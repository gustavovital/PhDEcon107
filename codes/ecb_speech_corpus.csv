Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, University College Cork Economics Society Conference 2025
Cork, 20 March 2025
It is a pleasure to participate in the annual conference of the UCC Economics Society. Today, I wish to discuss the digital euro, which is an important project at the ECB.[1]Draft legislation has been proposed by the European Commission and is currently under consideration by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.[2]
A few years ago, archaeologists excavated two silver coins at Carrignacurra Castle, not too far from here.[3]The first was a groat (a coin worth four pennies) from the 1200s depicting Henry III; the second was a coin from the 1400s featuring Edward IV. These two coins indicated a society that regarded precious metal as the embodiment of intrinsic value and closely associated money with sovereignty.
Over the centuries, the currency circulating in Ireland has changed multiple times. From 1927 until the launch of the euro, the Irish pound (the punt) was the national currency of Ireland. The punt was not backed by a precious metal, such as gold or silver. Rather, it was a fiat currency that derived its value from government regulation, the assets backing the currency and trust in the issuing authority, the Central Bank of Ireland and its forerunner the Currency Commission. Until 1979, the punt was pegged to the British pound sterling at a 1:1 exchange rate, reflecting the historical linkages with the United Kingdom and the significant bilateral trade volumes. It operated as legal tender until around a quarter century ago, when Ireland along with ten other EU Member States introduced the euro (twenty countries are now members of the euro area). By adopting the euro, Ireland reinforced its commitment to European integration, while also reducing its dependence on the UK monetary and financial system.
The developments in Ireland’s currency over time demonstrate how monetary systems are shaped by broader societal and economic transformations. For instance, the history of Irish money includes two episodes of free-banking money, whereby private banks issued banknotes that were used by the public as means of payment.[4]In this aspect, the monetary history of Ireland resembles that of Scotland, England and the United States. This history can shed some light on the current debate about the new forms of private money that are emerging today, such as stablecoins in the context of a digitalising society – a trend that has become more pronounced in recent years.[5]
In an increasingly digitalised society, in which the role of physical banknotes issued by the central bank is receding, the question arises whether the European Central Bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the euro area.[6]
Today, I will explain why it is imperative for the ECB to introduce a digital euro.[7]I will first discuss the roles of central bank money and commercial bank money over time, before describing a range of scenarios that suggest a digital euro is necessary to preserve the monetary autonomy of Europe. Finally, before concluding, I will outline the benefits of the digital euro for Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union.
Our current monetary system
Let me begin by recalling the three main characteristics of money: (i) it serves as a unit of account, (ii) it provides a medium of exchange, and (iii) it is a store of value.
The unit of account property solves a basic coordination problem in any economy: it is a lot easier to set prices and wages vis-a-vis a single benchmark (a loaf of bread is priced at, say, €2) rather than firms and households resorting to a diversity of benchmarks (a loaf of bread is priced at 10 apples). Through its interest rate and balance sheet policies, the central bank can provide overall price stability by ensuring that average prices do not rise by more than two per cent per year over the medium term.
The medium of exchange function reflects the superiority of monetary exchange to barter-type alternative systems.  Suppose someone earns income by working as a university professor but wishes to consume a wide range of goods and services: it is a lot simpler to receive her salary in euro and pay for her desired goods and services in euro rather than searching for suppliers that might be willing to exchange a particular good or service for a customised university lecture.  A huge volume of transactions occurs every day, with firms and household buying and selling products in exchange for monetary payments. The central bank anchors the payment systems that process these transactions. In particular, a request by a customer with an account in Bank A to make a €100 payment to a merchant with an account in Bank B is settled through an interbank transaction in which €100 is deducted from the reserve account of Bank A at the central bank and €100 is credited to the reserve account of Bank B at the central bank.
Money also acts a store of value.  Alongside other financial and non-financial assets, households also hold bank deposits and banknotes in order to transfer purchasing power from one period to the next. Since overnight bank deposits (current accounts) pay nil or very little interest and banknotes do not pay interest, money is typically dominated by other assets in relation to long-term saving and investment plans.[8]At the same time, money provides a highly-liquid store of value and its roles as a unit of account and medium of exchange are closely connected to its role in preserving liquidity from one period to the next.
In essence, our monetary system consists of two layers: “central bank money” and “commercial bank money”. The use of the term “money” here does not mean that we are speaking about two independent types of money. In practice, central bank money and commercial bank money are intertwined: indeed, it is essential that households and firms view these as equivalent. The label simply refers to the type of entity that issues the respective components of the aggregate money supply.More general terms for these two layers underline how money is created and distributed in the economy: since central bank money (banknotes and the central bank reserves held by commercial banks) is issued by the central bank, it originates outside the private sector and is referred to as“outside” money. By contrast, commercial bank money (bank deposits) originates from, and circulates within, the private sector and is called “inside” money(seen from the perspective of the private sector).
As central bank money is issued directly by the central bank, from an accounting perspective, it is backed by the assets of the central bank. That is, the Eurosystem can increase the supply of euro “outside” money by crediting the reserve accounts held by commercial banks at the central bank in exchange for assets. This can be done by providing a loan to a bank (strictly, a temporary collateralised loan under its refinancing operations) or by acquiring bonds.[9]As noted above, the reserve accounts held by commercial banks at the central bank are an essential component of the overall monetary system, since most monetary transactions involve an interbank transfer from the customer’s bank to the merchant’s bank whereby funds are deducted from the reserve account of the customer’s bank and credited to the reserve account of the merchant’s bank. In turn, this implies that a commercial bank can only efficiently provide banking services to its customers (and maintain the trust of its counterparts) if it has sufficient central bank reserves to meet payment and withdrawal requests. Currently, commercial banks hold about €3 trillion in reserve accounts in the Eurosystem (corresponding to about 20 per cent of euro area GDP). As euro liabilities of the central bank, these reserves are the ultimate safe asset: there is zero credit risk. Moreover, reserves are the highest form of liquidity (one euro is always one euro), which is the foundation for reserves as the settlement asset for inter-bank transactions.
The supply of euro “outside” money also includes about €1.6 trillion in banknotes (about 10 per cent of euro area GDP). Mechanically, banknotes are supplied via the banking system: an individual bank might request €10 million in banknotes to feed its ATMs or in response to the currency demands of its corporate customers and its reserve account with the Eurosystem is duly debited for this amount. If the bank does not have enough reserves for that operation, it must borrow them either from another bank or from the central bank itself. In the aggregate, this means the central bank also funds its acquisition of assets by issuing banknotes.
Unlike standard liabilities of other institutions, central bank money is not redeemable for commodities (such as gold) or alternative means of payment or stores of value. Instead, its intrinsic value comes from its acceptance as currency, which is deeply connected to the credibility of the monetary policy of the central bank in maintaining its value in terms of purchasing power (that is, maintaining price stability). This credibility is crucial because it shapes public trust in the currency and its stability.
In turn, the authority and credibility of the central bank are intrinsically linked to its sovereign foundations. In national currency systems, the central bank is established by the nation state as the monopoly provider of “outside” money.[10]In the euro area, the ECB was established by the Treaty on European Union and controls the issue of euro as a currency, with the mandate to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem (comprising the ECB and the national central banks of those EU Member States whose currency is the euro) decides and implements monetary policy decisions.
By contrast, commercial bank money is created through the lending and intermediation activities of commercial banks. Mechanically, when a bank makes a loan to a firm or household, it creates a deposit in the account of the borrower, thereby increasing the overall money supply (the sum of outside and inside money). The value of commercial bank money – mainly bank deposits – is pegged to central bank money: a €50 deposit has the same value as a €50 banknote. In turn, this means that retail transactions can be settled either by transferring funds from the bank account of the customer to the bank account of the merchant or by paying in banknotes.[11]The equivalence of bank deposits and banknotes is maintained through the promise of convertibility of bank deposits into banknotes (and vice versa): in particular, customers always have the outside option to withdraw their deposits in favour of banknotes that are backed by the central bank.
While banknotes (and coins) are still widely used to purchase goods and services, the central role played by commercial banks in an efficient payment system reflects the transactions services provided by banks to their depositors: inside money is particularly attractive as a means of payment, especially for large-scale transactions.[12][13]For all these reasons, commercial bank money today accounts for the bulk of the money in circulation. For instance, in the euro area, the size of our broad monetary aggregate M3 is ten times that of the banknotes in circulation.[14]
Inside money is ultimately backed by the assets of the commercial bank, primarily loans and, to a lesser extent, bonds. Put differently, commercial bank money is not completely “information insensitive” in the following sense: its value is conditional on the creditworthiness of borrowers and the financial health of banks. For this precise reason, commercial banks are heavily regulated and closely supervised.  In addition, deposit insurance limits the risk that a liquidity shortage may hamper the capacity of the bank to convert deposits into cash in full and on demand, while central banks typically respond to systemic stress events by elastically providing liquidity to the banking system. While these safeguards are extensive, the traditional ability of customers to convert bank deposits into banknotes has played a foundational role in ensuring that the value of inside money is anchored by the value of outside money. In particular, outside money is entirely “information insensitive” since it is the central bank that statutorily issues currency, which is the ultimate means for discharging liabilities in the economy. Furthermore, the direct access of the general public to outside money in the form of banknotes has underpinned the stability of the unit of account: in this way, everyone in society has had a personal (and, indeed, emotional) connection to central bank money.
This two-tier monetary system emerged gradually over the centuries.
The coins that were discovered in the nearby excavations in Cork are clear examples of state money – complete with depictions of a sovereign that reinforced the authority of the state backing the coins. Of course, the emergence of state money goes further back. In ancient civilisations such as the Roman Empire or imperial China, state money provided a degree of standardisation in terms of weight, metal content and design that ensured trust in the value of the coins.[15]This way, state-issued coins were recognised and accepted across the vast territories of the empire; these were “information insensitive” – facilitating trade and taxation and, in general, monetary exchanges. The standardisation was a public good which generated widespread benefits that individual agents could have not easily produced on their own, thus improving social welfare. A broadly accepted means of payment facilitated the local exchange of goods and fostered trade over longer distances. As indicated earlier, this contrasts with the disadvantages of the direct exchange of goods (or barter), which requires the “double coincidence of wants”.[16]
The need for more efficient financial instruments to support the expanding trade networks and economic activities in those economically dynamic empires also gave rise to the origins of inside money. In the China of the Tang Dynasty (the High Middle Ages in western chronology), the “feiqian” or “flying cash” was developed to solve the challenges of long-distance trade. The “feiqian” functioned as a promissory note, allowing the holder to redeem it for cash at a designated location. That experience paved the way for the issuance of “jiaozi”, the first exchange notes, which appeared before the end of the first millennium. These circulated freely in the market, becoming the first paper money, which helped China overcome challenges such as coin shortages in the context of a rapidly growing economy.[17]Moreover, it is worth noting that Song China’s paper money was initially freely issued by private merchants and later taken over by the government to ensure stability and trust. The lessons from China’s monetary history do not end there: over-issuance brought paper money to an end during the 15th century (Ming dynasty).[18]
The complex societies of Rome and imperial China also generated early forms of banking.[19]However, the economic revival of late medieval and Renaissance Europe recreated banking in a way that expanded its activities to accepting deposits, making loans and engaging in trade remittance, with a proliferation of letters of exchange. All that came with a simple, but crucial, technological innovation affecting ledgers: double-entry bookkeeping improved the accuracy, transparency and reliability of financial records.[20]
Nevertheless, Renaissance Europe experienced challenges related to the complexity and fragmentation of the system, with numerous kingdoms, principalities and city states each issuing their own currency. In certain cases, this gave rise to a sort of “currency substitution”, with a widespread acceptance and use of certain currencies well beyond their issuing region due to their perceived stability, the economic and political power of their issuers and the trust these commanded in international trade.[21]
Still, the public deposit banks of that period, which were precursors of central banks as we know them today, contributed to the stability to the monetary system and reduced its complexity. These public deposit banks offered settlement of payments in their accounts and some of them were pioneers in creating certificates of deposits that could be used as proto-banknotes.[22]Indeed, it was that government backing that helped the banknotes issued by the Swedish Riksbank (founded in 1668) and by the Bank of England (founded in 1694), the oldest central banks that still operate today, to achieve widespread acceptance in the course of the 18th century.[23]
The popularity of banknotes reflected a tacit acknowledgement that a monetary system solely consisting of precious metals was not only inconvenient but could not keep pace with the rapidly growing needs of commerce.[24]Without a government monopoly in the issuance of banknotes, private institutions not linked to the government also started issuing banknotes, as had already occurred in China almost a millennium earlier. The apex of that development occurred during the free-banking experiences in the 19th century, a system characterised by competitive note issuance with low legal barriers to entry, and little or no central control of the assets backing these banknotes.[25]At that time, these assets mainly consisted of scarce commodities such as gold or of certain securities deemed to have low enough risk.
However, repeated panics and banking crises during the century led early central banks such as the Bank of England and the Riksbank to de facto assume the role of lender of last resort – one of the classical tasks of a modern central bank, as articulated in Walter Bagehot’sLombard Street: a description of the money marketin 1873.[26][27]By ensuring that banks had sufficient liquidity to meet requests to exchange bank deposits for cash, the frequency and severity of banking crises were reduced and the resulting system helped bridge the gap between outside and inside money. The gap was further closed by the growing moves towards the central bank’s monopoly as sole issuer of banknotes and the legal establishment of state-backed paper money as legal tender.[28]
However, at the time, central banks and governments had not yet developed the institutional frameworks and policy tools necessary to manage such fiat currencies effectively.[29]Rather, credibility relied on backing currency with metallic standards. The straitjacket of a metallic standard constrained their ability to flexibly respond to macroeconomic fluctuations and financial crises – as evident, for instance, during the gold standard period.[30]
As the twentieth century progressed, the monetary system evolved beyond the constraints of metallic standards. The comprehensive regulation of banks, the establishment of deposit guarantee schemes and the abandonment of the gold standard, particularly after the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the early 1970s, permitted the transition to our layered fiat currency system. In that system, privately-issued means of payment in the form of scriptural inside money is valued to the extent that there is sufficient confidence that it can always be converted in full and upon demand into what has become the foundation of the whole monetary architecture: unbacked outside money issued, in the form of paper banknotes or electronic reserves held by commercial banks, by a sovereign or a central bank acting in the public interest.[31][32]
Modern central banks now operate within institutional frameworks that prioritise transparency, independence, and accountability. By relying on these flexible and credible setups, and within the guardrails of their statutes that mandate them to the pursuit of clear objectives, central banks have acquired and retained the tools for managing the currency in a way that fosters price stability and balanced growth.
The historical evolution of our monetary system highlights several key lessons. Central banks, by ensuring standardisation of outside money, trust in its value, and fungibility, provide an important public good: price stability as the prerequisite for macroeconomic stability. At the same time, inside money enhances the efficiency of the monetary system by addressing practical challenges, leveraging technological innovations, and meeting the liquidity and transaction needs of complex economies. The lesson of history is that inside money is best safeguarded through regulation and supervision of banks, the provision of deposit insurance and the willingness of the central bank to act as the lender of last resort in the event of a systemic liquidity crisis. In summary, an optimal combination of both inside money and outside money creates an efficient and resilient monetary system that can adapt to changing technological and economic conditions while maintaining stability and public trust in the currency.
CBDC as a robust response to digitalisation
This evolution has brought us to the stable two-tier monetary system that I highlighted earlier. Central bank money serves as the monetary anchor: the central bank has full sovereignty over monetary policy; all forms of commercial bank money are convertible at par with central bank money; and payments can be made with both inside and outside money.
We are now witnessing a profound technological revolution that is reshaping economies worldwide. Naturally, as has always been the case, money will adapt to these shifts. I am referring to three trends in particular.
First, the increasing digitalisation of our economy is changing payment methods and behaviours. For instance, e-commerce now accounts for around one third of non-recurring payments in the euro area. Similarly, e-payment solutions (e-payment wallets and mobile apps) are gaining traction, growing at double-digit rates.[33]These developments highlight the diminishing role of physical banknotes as a means of payment in an increasingly digital world.[34]
Second, entirely new forms of financial assets are emerging in in the wake of this digital transformation. Decentralised finance applications and crypto-assets such as bitcoin aim to bypass traditional financial intermediation. Of particular relevance as a medium of exchange are stablecoins. The proponents of stablecoins seek to combine the advantages of distributed ledger technologies with a stable conversion rate into traditional currencies. By contrast, crypto-assets such as bitcoin are not well suited to performing the medium of exchange function due to high price volatility and an incapacity to process high volumes of transactions at speed.
Third, digital ecosystems – platforms such as Alibaba and Alipay that integrate proprietary forms of money with other services – are creating closed environments that encourage consumers to remain within specific systems.[35]
These technological advances offer opportunities, such as a more efficient and innovative financial system, but also pose challenges. These have the potential to disrupt the delicate balance of the two-tier monetary system and could threaten the sovereignty of central banks over monetary policy. Taking a forward-looking perspective is crucial because network effects heavily influence how money and payment systems evolve. The more widely a form of money or payment application is used, the more attractive it becomes to others – a dynamic that can entrench suboptimal developments if these take hold. For instance, once the adoption of a payment system or a communication app reaches a certain threshold, people tend to continue using it because others are also using it, which makes it more convenient but also “locks in” users. At that point, reversing the adoption trend becomes exceedingly difficult.
It follows that we need to anticipate this type of development and be prepared if it materialises, because our responsibility is to ensure that the foundations of a monetary system that has proved its value are preserved for the future. I would like to explore the three trends that I have just identified in more detail and understand their implications. Those trends are likely to occur simultaneously and to various degrees, and are likely to interact with each other. Nevertheless, to simplify the analysis, let me analyse these trends one by one.
Within an ever-expanding digital economy, there is an increasing share of online transactions. The ECB remains committed to continue providing physical cash in the future and ensuring cash acceptance throughout the euro area. At the same time, the more transactions are made online, the lower the possibility for consumers to pay with physical banknotes, which are the legal tender and – together with their electronic counterparts, the central-bank-issued euro reserves held by banks – constitute the current form of central bank money.[36]This is obviously a natural technological progression, but it raises profound questions about the role of central bank money and the stability of the monetary system.
Will monetary policy remain effective and the monetary system cohesive if that trend continues? Traditionally, cash has played a critical role in maintaining trust in the convertibility of commercial bank money into central bank money and supporting effective monetary policy. Cash issued by the central bank acts as a “glue” and vivid reminder that all forms of money – whether commercial bank deposits or other forms of inside money – owe their wide acceptance in commerce to their convertibility into central bank money at par. This possibility of convertibility fosters trust in the value of deposits and helps to contain the “information sensitivity” of commercial bank money to a minimum, such that transactions of goods and services are fluid and unhampered by a constant need to verify the standing of the means of payment offered in exchange.
Conversely, the absence of such a monetary anchor could slow down and fragment the web of daily transactions that form the modern-day multi-trillion payment system. In addition to fostering trust, having public access to central bank money serves as a disciplining mechanism, providing a reliable fallback option to using commercial bank money.[37]In turn, the option of using central bank money for payments limits the scope for commercial payment systems to exploit monopoly power to charge excessive payment fees.[38]As the share of online transactions increases, the extent to which the option to make payments in cash can act as a disciplinary tool against market power decreases.
The convertibility stipulation that lies at the foundation of our layered monetary system necessitates that commercial banks are granted access to central bank money in sufficient amounts to always be able to convert deposits into banknotes upon demand. As noted earlier, the central bank creates reserves – an electronic form of cash that can only be held by commercial banks – by making loans to the banks or by purchasing assets. Together with the interest rates charged on loans to banks, the interest rate paid on the reserves held by banks is the lever through which a modern central bank influences interest rates across the financial system, thereby affecting monetary conditions across the economy.[39]
Without positive demand for central bank money, this link would weaken or disappear, undermining the ability of the central bank to guide monetary conditions.As inflation is determined over the medium term by monetary policy, dwindling demand for central bank money could threaten the control of the monetary authority over inflation and risk price indeterminacy.[40]
Even if there was zero demand for banknotes and the general public did not directly hold money issued by the central bank, there would still be demand from commercial banks for the electronic cash (reserves) issued by the central bank in order to have sufficient liquidity to cope with high and volatile volumes of interbank payments and to be in a position to meet deposit withdrawal requests.[41]In principle, under normal conditions, the central bank could continue to deliver price stability by raising or lowering the interest rates paid on the reserve deposits held by commercial banks and the interest rates charged to supply extra reserves through making loans to commercial banks.
However, if the general public did not directly hold central bank money, an important and historic safeguard would no longer be available, namely the ability of firms and households to make direct payments in central bank money – banknotes. Moreover, the absence of a default central bank payments option that sits outside the commercial banking system could also endanger the capacity of the central bank to deliver price stability, especially under stressed conditions. In particular, if the payments system were to be totally dependent on the soundness of commercial banks, this would further raise the stakes in scenarios in which liquidity provision to commercial banks might run against the appropriate monetary policy stance. In summary, while the private incentives of individual commercial banks and the array of safeguards discussed above go a long way in underpinning monetary stability, the weakening of the effective capacity of the general public to transact in central bank money directionally increases risk in the monetary system.
What are the challenges facing our monetary system in an era of rapid technological change? Intuitively, distributed ledger technologies can provide the technological platform for a decentralised system in which private issuers could offer to settle transactions in secure and apparently “information insensitive” forms of money outside traditional central bank systems. For example, bearer-based stablecoins – digital representations of private electronic banknotes that are designed to be backed by safe assets such as government bonds or bank deposits – could bypass settlement via central bank reserves altogether, thereby creating a monetary ecosystem that flies under the radar of central bank oversight.[42]
In particular, central bank money would play a much-diminished role in the payments system, if households and firms were to maintain their primary transaction accounts in stablecoins and only use commercial bank accounts to upload and download funds from these transaction accounts.[43]In a sense, a stablecoin provider would resemble a so-called narrow bank that only holds high quality liquid assets and promises to maintain a stable value of its liabilities (the funds held by customers in their stablecoin accounts). While the pros and cons of narrow banking have been much debated over the decades, a material decline in the volume of deposits held in commercial banks would disrupt the role of commercial banks in credit provision, which is especially prominent in the bank-based European financial system. Moreover, even if stablecoins were fully backed by deposits in the commercial banking system (that is the stablecoin provider would match stablecoin liabilities with deposit assets), these deposits would effectively constitute “wholesale” deposits rather than “retail” deposits, resulting in a lower liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).[44]
Indeed, stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of assets, have already gained a significant foothold in the crypto-asset universe.[45][46]Their appeal lies in their ease of use and innovative features and in the possibility for fast, low-cost transactions.[47]While stablecoins play a central role in settling transactions in other crypto assets, it is clear that stablecoins are also attracting interest in the facilitating low-cost cross-border transactions in the “traditional” economy and financial system.
In particular, despite significant technological progress, cross-border trade between countries remains to this day costly and inefficient, with large-value payments going through the correspondent banking network, which can take days to settle. There are unrealised positive network externalities, which are particularly evident to companies that maintain global supply chains.[48]Subject to being credibly backed by high-quality liquid assets, stablecoins can acquire a degree of global acceptability in wholesale transactions that can, in principle, address the inefficiencies that merchants face when making large cross-border payments through banks.
At the same time, as these digital assets continue to evolve and gather pace, one has to carefully assess their potential spillovers for domestic retail payments and consider the implications for the monetary system more broadly. In particular, as noted earlier, an equilibrium could emerge in which households and firms maintain transaction accounts with stablecoin providers, causing bank deposits and banknotes to lose relevance as a medium of exchange. Indeed, it is possible to imagine workers receiving salary payments in stablecoins (or immediately transferring salary payments from bank deposits to stablecoin accounts).
Let’s consider two potential situations.
To start, imagine a situation in which euro-based stablecoins assert themselves as new dominant players. Imagine the pool of safe assets backing the stablecoins being directly or indirectly backed by the reserve accounts of commercial banks with the Eurosystem. These new instruments would essentially represent a novel form of inside money within our euro-based monetary system. Their strength would lie in their accessibility and transferability, potentially increasing the efficiency of the monetary system, especially in cross-border transactions or in facilitating so-called smart contracts.[49]Unlike traditional money market funds, such stablecoins could seamlessly serve as both savings and payment instruments.[50]Critically, the ultimate nature of the two-layered system I was describing before would be preserved, with euro reserves issued by the Eurosystem providing the foundation of the new monetary order: the commercial banks that stablecoin providers deposit their funds with would need to hold larger reserve accounts to accommodate withdrawal requests from the stablecoin provider.
Still, a two-layer monetary architecture in which “inside money” transactions are dominated by stablecoins rather than by commercial banks would pose new challenges. First, the new form of money would be less “information insensitive” than the inside money created in the current institutional environment. The reason for this is essentially inadequate regulation and supervision. Recent experience has shown that, given the regulatory and supervisory vacuum in which these operate, some stablecoins can fail to maintain their intended stability, deviating (sometimes in dramatic fashion) from par value with their underlying reference asset.[51]While this risk would be minimal if the assets backing stablecoins were exclusively composed of deposits in the commercial banking system, stablecoin providers would naturally be tempted to hold higher-yielding but riskier securities in their asset portfolio. If the conversion rate between inside money – the stablecoins – and the anchoring asset can change, it is up to the holder and the payee in a transaction to verify whether parity holds. This process is costly and prone to changes in sentiment. A change in sentiment about the capacity of the issuer to redeem the stablecoins at par could lead to systemic shocks and runs of the sort seen in the era of free banking, when private banks were given the authority to issue their own currency backed by Treasury bonds.[52]In summary, while the “moneyness” of stablecoins relies on one-to-one convertibility into currency, this promise carries less credibility for stablecoin providers, which do not perform bank-like tasks such as credit provision to the economy and are not supervised or back-stopped by the central bank.
Second, as funds shift towards these new instruments, the stability of the financial system could be affected. At least part of the asset pool providing collateral for the stablecoins would be in the form of bank deposits.[53]However, as indicated above, this recycling of household and firm deposits back into the banking sector would only partially compensate the losses that banks would suffer in the first place as those cheap and more stable deposits migrate to the stablecoins domain. This shift would increase bank funding costs and negatively affect credit supply. Additionally, large stablecoin issuers would likely concentrate their holdings in safer, more liquid banks, further intensifying the effects for other banks in the economy. As stablecoin-managed assets grow, competition for liquid resources would increase their scarcity and price, resulting in still-higher costs for banks to maintain their buffers of liquid assets.
A second scenario imagines a new world with an increasing prevalence of stablecoins that are effectively backed by assets denominated in a foreign currency.[54]Given that the majority of existing stablecoins are linked to the US dollar, this is not a purely hypothetical scenario.[55]At some level, dollar stablecoins make it easier for European households to acquire low-risk dollar assets (typically, it is not easy to open a dollar bank account for European residents). The macro-financial implications of lower frictions in international capital mobility are well understood, both in “normal” times and “crisis” times. However, the open question is whether dollar stablecoins could also gain a foothold in domestic transactions in the euro area, whereby the domestic payments system becomes directly or indirectly anchored by the dollar rather than the euro.[56][57]
While the likelihood of this scenario is hard to quantify, a full risk assessment warrants inspection of even tail-type scenarios. A growing prevalence of digital dollarisation would undermine monetary sovereignty by compromising the ability to control the unit of account within its jurisdiction. This means the domestic currency would risk losing its status as the dominant currency for expressing prices and settling most trades. Although ‘dominant’ lacks a precise defining threshold, as the share of transactions settled in the domestic currency decreases, the capacity of the central bank to implement effective monetary policy and maintain price stability is significantly impaired.[58]For the euro area, the erosion of monetary sovereignty would also have a historic symbolic meaning. Such an erosion would affect the euro as a symbol of European identity and the perceived cohesion of the entire monetary system.[59]
The challenges and risks associated with a potential fading role of currencies anchored in a public function are amplified if one considers the closed and captive environments in which private digital alternatives are sometimes created. Many privately-issued forms of digital money are offered within ecosystems that are designed to generate such powerful network effects as to make it difficult for users to seek alternatives.[60]By bundling payments with other services and restricting interoperability, platforms can establish so-called walled gardens, leveraging network effects to lock in users and making the loss of convenience or the cost of leaving the platform prohibitively high.[61]Transaction accounts would be reduced to a “club good” offered in return for the payment of a fee or membership of a platform. In addition to the loss of monetary sovereignty, if combined with monetisation of payment data, such a scenario would entail the build-up of market power imbalances, inefficiencies and, ultimately, an unprecedented degradation of a competition-based economy.[62][63]
The trends I have outlined highlight the potential for technological innovation to disrupt monetary transmission, monetary sovereignty, the singleness of money, and the welfare and fairness of society. Central banks have a mandate to safeguard monetary stability in all circumstances. This responsibility calls for a cautious yet forward-looking approach, ensuring we are ready to address challenges and forestall risks before they materialise.
A powerful and forward-looking response to these challenges lies in the issuance of a digital euro – a digital form of cash that would be available to the general public. Following a prudent risk management approach, introducing a digital euro would minimise the likelihood of adverse economic outcomes in the future and ensure the resilience of our monetary system in an increasingly digital world.
In a scenario in which the use of physical cash declines substantially, the digital euro can preserve public access to “information insensitive” central bank money and protect the capacity of the central bank to deliver its macroeconomic mandate in a digital world.
The digital euro is also an effective tool to limit the dominance of foreign digital currencies, including the monetary sovereignty risks created by widely-adopted foreign-currency stablecoins.[64]Furthermore, in a world dominated by platform-based payment systems, where payments are bundled with other services in closed ecosystems, a digital euro would provide an open and interoperable alternative, preventing the fragmentation and limited interoperability of money. A digital euro could help to ensure a socially optimal level of data protection and would enable citizens to transact in the digital economy while enjoying the privacy benefits associated with cash.[65]With appropriate design features, the digital euro can deliver these benefits without destabilising financial institutions or disrupting monetary policy implementation or transmission. For example, appropriately calibrated limits on digital euro holdings can prevent excessive outflows from commercial banks while still providing individuals with access to secure digital money.[66]
In essence, issuing the digital euro is not just about adapting to technological change. It is about safeguarding the core principles that underpin our monetary system – stability, trust, and inclusivity – in an era of rapid transformation.
Securing the future of the euro area: the strategic importance of the digital euro
For the multi-country euro area, the benefits of a CBDC are more extensive compared to the calculus for an individual nation state with its own currency. It addresses challenges unique to our monetary union, while strengthening the position of the euro in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical world.
In particular, let me now turn my attention to the domestic payments system in the euro area. The payments system is multi-layered: a customer might pay her mortgage, rent and utilities bills by direct debit from her account but will typically use a card or e-wallet for electronic transactions in-store or online. In this multi-layered system, the customer pre-loads funds onto a card or into an e-wallet, or has a line of credit (as with a credit card).[67]These cards and e-wallets offer many advantages but also pose some risks, especially if the intermediaries offering cards and e-wallets are not European.
Against this backdrop, the digital euro presents a unique opportunity to overcome the persistent fragmentation in retail payment systems acrossthe euro area. Unlike single-nation currency systems, the monetary union faces distinct challenges due  to diverse legacy national standards and a non-unified retail payment system.[68]This fragmentation has led to a shortage of pan-European payment options, creating barriers for customers and businesses engaging in cross-border transactions within the euro area.[69]While some of these frictions are so embedded to the point of near-invisibility from the point of view of many households, it is not cost free that customers must generally rely on non-European card or e-wallet providers to make payments across the euro area, with the partial exceptions of some domestic-only or regional card/e-wallet schemes in some countries or if a customer and a merchant happen to both have accounts with a particular fintech firm.
This has inadvertently strengthened the dominance of foreign companies in our payments landscape, especially for card payments, which currently account for the majority of retail payment transactions by value.[70]This fragmented landscape undermines competition, limits consumer choice, drives up costs and restricts the ability of the euro area to fully harness the advantages of digitalisation for its citizens and businesses.[71][72]
By mandating acceptance of the digital euro (by extending the legal tender status of banknotes to the digital world), we can create instant network effects that unify our fragmented market. Moreover, a standardised, pan-European platform would enable private payment providers to innovate, while benefiting from economies of scale, ultimately reducing costs for consumers and businesses alike. While, in principle, an integrated area-wide “fast payment system” (FPS) could alternatively be developed by forceful regulatory initiatives and highly-coordinated investments across the universe of private payment providers, this is less feasible in the context of a multi-country monetary union with possibly non-aligned interests across different legacy payment systems.[73]
For banks and payment service providers, the digital euro would serve as a catalyst for collaboration. It provides an economic incentive for these institutions to join forces to build a unified and innovative payment system that spans all retail use cases – whether peer-to-peer, point-of-sale transactions, or e-commerce. In particular, by linking customers and merchants across the euro area via the system of digital euro accounts, card and e-wallet providers could focus on providing additional payment services under which the underlying payments “travel” via the digital euro system. This unified approach would strengthen the financial ecosystem of the euro area, enabling it to compete more effectively with large foreign technology firms by delivering innovative products at scale and at competitive prices.[74]As a not-for-profit venture, the digital euro would reduce costs for merchants and businesses, thereby increasing bargaining power vis-à-vis international card schemes, both for physical stores and in e-commerce.
Importantly, unlike private entities that often monetise payment data for commercial purposes, the digital euro prioritises user privacy, ensuring that citizens can transact securely in a digital economy without compromising their privacy.[75]
The digital euro would also play a crucial role in strengthening the strategic autonomy of Europe in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. We are witnessing a global shift towards a more multipolar monetary system, with payments systems and currencies increasingly wielded as instruments of geopolitical influence and competing jurisdictions seek to assert their independence from foreign monetary powers.[76]
The rise of cryptocurrencies that enable direct, intermediary-free transactions, challenges the traditional financial system. In addition, China’s development of the digital yuan, the exploration by the BRICS nations of a platform to link their central bank digital initiatives (the BRICS Bridge), and the mBridge project, involving China, Thailand, Hong Kong and the UAE exemplify how digital currencies can offer efficient cross-border payments. These are clear indicators of the ongoing global multipolar monetary trend.[77]
In this context, Europe faces significant vulnerabilities. In the absence of attractive pan-European digital payment solutions, Europe’s reliance on foreign payment providers has reached striking levels. International card schemes such as Visa and Mastercard now process sixty-five per cent of euro area card payments. In thirteen out of the twenty euro area countries, national card schemes have been entirely replaced by these international alternatives.[78]In addition, mobile app payments, dominated by non-European tech firms (such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal), now account for nearly a tenth of retail transactions and are showing double-digit annual growth.
This dependence exposes Europe to risks of economic pressure and coercion and has implications for our strategic autonomy, limiting our ability to control critical aspects of our financial infrastructure.[79]When we rely on international cards, apps or stablecoins, we effectively outsource our payment infrastructure. This leaves European payments vulnerable to changing terms of use or to service withdrawal threats.[80]As discussed in the previous section, these risks could be further compounded by the growing dominance of foreign technology companies and a potential increase in the holdings of foreign-currency stablecoins. Currently, ninety-nine per cent of the stablecoin market is linked to the US dollar, and European interest in these instruments is increasing rapidly.[81][82]
The digital euro is a promising solution to counter these risks and ensure the euro area retains control over its financial future. It would provide a secure, universally-accepted digital payment option under European governance, reducing reliance on foreign providers. From a strategic perspective, the digital euro would curtail the risk that domestic-currency stablecoins might gain a significant market share in the domestic payments system, which would be highly disruptive for the banking system and credit intermediation. Likewise, the availability of the digital euro would also limit the likelihood of foreign-currency stablecoins gaining a foothold as a medium of exchange in the euro area.[83]However, especially taking into account the power of network externalities, these risks would increase if there were delays in launching a digital euro.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The monetary system – and the currencies within that system – has seen a substantial transformation over the centuries. This transformation continues today. As societies become increasingly digital, central banks are exploring the benefits of introducing CBDCs to align with the needs of consumers and keep the monetary system fit for purpose in the digital age. The case for a CBDC is especially strong for a monetary union, especially in the context of a fragmented and externally-dependent payments system.
At a time of geopolitical uncertainty and shocks, the euro has maintained its reputation as a strong and stable currency. Well over three-quarters of citizens in the euro area now support the single currency – a record high.[84]And at eighty-nine per cent, Irish support for the euro is among the highest in the euro area.[85]However, as technology and the economy evolve, we need to ensure that we retain the monetary autonomy to preserve monetary stability under all circumstances.
The digital euro is not just about making sure our monetary system adapts to the digital age. It is about ensuring that Europe controls its monetary and financial destiny, against a backdrop of increasing geopolitical fragmentation."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 20 March 2025
It is a pleasure to be back in Brussels for our regular exchange.
Since we last met in December, the new US administration has taken office and embarked on a new course in domestic and foreign policy. This has far-reaching implications for the global economic and political landscape, and it forces Europe to address both long-standing and new challenges in trade, economic competitiveness and defence. It is clear that the world is not waiting for us.
In this context, your chosen topic of trade policies is pertinent and extremely timely. However, before we discuss that topic in more detail, let me start by updating you on the euro area economic outlook and the ECB’s monetary policy stance.
The outlook for the euro area
In 2024 the euro area economy recovered despite many headwinds. Euro area GDP grew by 0.9% on average, about twice as much as it did in 2023. Growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2024, however, and the first months of this year have seen a continuation of many of last year’s underlying patterns. Manufacturing is still contracting, although survey indicators are improving. High domestic and global policy uncertainty is holding back investment, and competitiveness challenges are weighing on exports. At the same time, services remain resilient. Moreover, rising household incomes and a robust labour market are supporting a gradual pick-up in consumption.
Heightened uncertainty is likely to dampen investment and exports more than previously anticipated. However, growth is expected to be supported by higher incomes and lower borrowing costs. Additionally, exports should benefit from rising global demand, though this remains contingent on developments in international trade policies. The latest ECB staff projections expect the economy to grow by 0.9% in 2025, 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027.[1]These estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, also owing to the trade policy environment, which I will discuss in the second part of my statement.
Turning to price developments, the disinflation process is well on track. Headline inflation decreased from 2.5% in January to 2.3% in February, mainly on account of a drop in energy inflation. Core inflation – excluding energy and food – also declined slightly from 2.7% in January to 2.6% in February, reflecting lower services inflation. Domestic inflation edged down in February but remains high, as wages and services prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge.
Nominal wage growth moderated over the course of 2024. It is expected to continue decelerating in the coming months as real wages have caught up with levels seen before the surge in inflation, leading to fewer demands for inflation compensation.
The ECB staff projections see inflation moderating slightly in the coming months and then hovering around our 2% target as of the first quarter of 2026. Headline inflation is expected to average 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027.
The ECB’s monetary policy stance
Let me now turn to our monetary policy stance.
Earlier this month we lowered our key interest rates by another 25 basis points. Inflation is developing broadly as expected, with most measures of underlying inflation suggesting that inflation will settle at around our 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis.
The deposit facility rate now stands at 2.50% – 150 basis points below the 2024 peak. Our monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive. New borrowing is becoming less expensive for firms and households, while loan growth is picking up. At the same time, past interest rate hikes are still being transmitted to the stock of loans, and lending remains subdued overall.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-term target. Especially in current conditions of rising uncertainty, we will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
The impact of a shift in US trade policies
Let me now turn to the second topic of this hearing – the impact of the shift in US trade policies on the euro area.
The new US administration is changing direction in several policy areas, with trade being a focal point. As a result, uncertainty about the future path of trade policy has soared to exceptionally high levels.
In our interconnected world, increased trade frictions are detrimental to global growth and welfare.[2]They raise costs, disrupt production and often lead to an adjustment of supply chains.[3]This also encourages “tit-for-tat” retaliatory policies, further undermining the benefits of free trade.
The euro area, which is very open to trade and deeply integrated into global supply chains, especially with the United States, is particularly exposed to shifts in trade policies.[4]
As regards the impact of specific trade measures, the situation is of course still evolving, and any estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. That said, ECB analysis suggests that a US tariff of 25% on imports from Europe would lower euro area growth by about 0.3 percentage points in the first year. A European response in the form of raising tariffs on US imports would further increase this to about half a percentage point. The brunt of the impact on economic growth would concentrate around the first year after the rise in tariffs; it would then diminish over time, however leaving a persistent negative effect on the level of output.
In such a scenario, the inflation outlook would become significantly more uncertain. In the near term, EU retaliatory measures and a weaker euro exchange rate – resulting from lower US demand for European products – could lift inflation by around half a percentage point. The effect would ease in the medium term due to lower economic activity dampening inflationary pressures.
Let me stress again that these estimates are subject to very high uncertainty given that the impact of tariff increases may be non-linear, for instance due to a significant reconfiguration of global supply chains. Of course, the high level of policy uncertainty requires us to remain vigilant and ready to act to protect price stability.
Crucially, the answer to the current shift in US trade policies should be more, not less, trade integration, both with trade partners around the globe and within the EU. Trade integration, including free trade agreements, has been a driver of economic prosperity and can protect against unilateral trade measures. In fact, ECB analysis indicates that closer integration with the rest of the world could more than offset losses incurred from unilateral tariffs, including retaliation. In such a scenario only countries engaging in isolationist policies stand to lose. It is therefore important that the EU remains open to trade, and swiftly finalising recent trade agreements with other international partners would be a powerful signal.
We must also use these developments as a catalyst for deepening trade between EU Member States. The Single Market is estimated to have added between 12% and 22% to long-run EU GDP in its first 30 years,[5]and the level of trade between Member States has doubled since its creation.[6]
A deeper Single Market is crucial for reducing trade barriers within Europe and creating the scale necessary for firms to thrive. In addition, the more we exploit our own market, the more resilient Europe is to the impact of global fragmentation and external shocks more generally. With its Competitiveness Compass, the European Commission has put forward a concrete roadmap that should be urgently implemented. In this context, the plan for the savings and investment union presented yesterday is another crucial step.
By enhancing our strategic autonomy and increasing our economic clout, Europe negotiates with trade partners from a position of greater strength – strength that we can only gain collectively.
At the ECB, we will continue to carefully monitor global trade developments and take their impact into account in our monetary policy deliberations. In the current environment, it is important that we anticipate and assess implications of potential trade policy changes.[7]Careful analysis and communication are key, and we are exploring both aspects further as part of our ongoing strategy assessment.
Conclusion
To conclude – in today’s turbulent environment, only a united Europe is a stronger Europe.
Jean Monnet once said “make men –and might I also add women– work together; show them that, beyond their differences and geographical boundaries, there lies a common interest”.
This common interest is the prosperity of people in the EU. To achieve it, we must continue to uphold free trade, and we must strengthen our union.
The Single Market enables this, as it can contain the impact of global trade fragmentation. Let us continue to strengthen this precious tool and forge our own destiny in the interest of all Europeans.
Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to your questions."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference
London, 19 March 2025
We are living in unprecedented, turbulent times. Not a single week goes by without significant shifts in the global economy. We are seeing a surge in tariffs, an unravelling of global trade and a growing transatlantic divide leading to new geopolitical realities, all while wars continue right on our doorstep.
Meanwhile, the debate on financial regulation is also intensifying. Some have raised the question as to whether regulation and supervision have become too conservative that they may be hindering competitiveness. Perhaps some of the investors and bankers here in this room are asking themselves the very same question.
In my remarks today, I will highlight that, particularly in an era of heightened economic uncertainty and geopolitical shifts, we need competitive banks that ensure the flow of finance into investment and innovation. I will argue, however, that a vital pre-condition for banks to play their fundamentally important role of financing the real economy is that they remain resilient. Because a banking system that cannot withstand shocks cannot reliably finance the economy, especially when it matters most. And while there are merits in removing undue complexity from the regulatory framework without compromising resilience, the debate on competitiveness should not be used as a pretext for watering down regulation. Rather than reducing complexity by lowering regulatory requirements, it would be more effective to achieve simplification through European harmonisation: don’t cut rules, harmonise them.
Resilience of the European banking sector
Let me start with resilience. Over the past decade European banks have become significantly stronger. Thanks to robust regulatory guardrails and rigorous supervision, today’s banking sector is far more resilient than it was ten years ago. This is reflected in higher capital and liquidity buffers, improved risk management and better governance.
Euro area significant banks are currently in a good financial position, with the aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 ratio standing at 15.7% in the third quarter of 2024. Similarly, the leverage ratio stands comfortably above regulatory requirements at 5.8%. I anticipate that the data for the fourth quarter of 2024, due for release tomorrow, will confirm this overall trend.[1]
Liquidity ratios also remain well above regulatory requirements, with the liquidity coverage ratio standing at 158.5% and the net stable funding ratio at 126.9%.
This resilience is not a coincidence, but a testament to the joint efforts undertaken by regulators, supervisors and banks over the last decade.
It is worth remembering that the strong regulatory and pan-European supervisory framework was put in place as a response to the great financial crisis, which remains the biggest growth-destroying event in modern economic history.[2]The aim of legislators was clear: never again should we let excessive risk-taking, insufficient regulation and “light touch” supervision fuel another crisis like the one that affected millions of Europeans and resulted in average output losses of 8.5% of GDP in EU countries.
Encouragingly, Europe can look back on a decade of financial stability. Building on this renewed resilience, euro area banks are now in a much better position to support households and companies.
To ensure banks can continue to play this crucial role, their ability to earn sustainable profits is an indispensable component of resilience: without profits, banks cannot organically generate capital, make the necessary investment in future-proof IT systems, finance their clients’ growth projects and remain attractive to investors.[3]Encouragingly, the profitability of euro area significant banks has notably improved, with the aggregate annualised return on equity (RoE) standing at 10.2% in the third quarter of 2024. Despite this improvement, the positive effect of higher net interest income seems to have already peaked.Moreover, although banks have seen their return on equity increase, it is still barely higher than their own cost of equity estimates.[4]This shows that banks must keep a close eye on their operating efficiency.
One possible way of improving operating efficiency would be to reap economies of scale. Scaling up would enable banks to arrive at the investment budgets they need for digitalisation and cybersecurity.
In a highly fragmented European banking system, these economies of scale could also be achieved through market consolidation. We have repeatedly stressed that from a supervisory perspective, we see benefits in cross-border mergers and will not stand in the way of consolidation. What matters is that the acquisition results in safe and sound banks, regardless of who the proposed acquirer is or whether it concerns a domestic or cross-border acquisition.Our supervisory assessment is limited to the prudential grounds and criteria laid down in a limitative manner in the law. This means ensuring that new entities resulting from business combinations have sustainable business models, comply with regulatory and supervisory requirements and have sound governance and risk management arrangements in place.[5]Back in 2021, to be as transparent as possible about our approach for the benefit of market participants, we published a guide to consolidation in the banking sector clearly setting out our supervisory expectations.
Risk outlook
Resilience must, however, not lead to complacency. The risk environment is changing in ways that demand our continued vigilance.
Although euro area GDP growth improved slightly to 0.7% in 2024, it remains subdued. In addition to the risks to the GDP outlook being tilted to the downside, structural trends are developing that may cause significant bottlenecks in global and European economies in the period ahead.[6]
For example, geopolitical tensions are not expected to subside, we are seeing economic fragmentation along geopolitical fault lines and protectionist measures are growing. And while all of this is happening, the climate and nature crises – although lately it seems less fashionable in certain circles to point out this undeniable fact – are getting worse, and natural disasters are becoming ever more frequent, severe and costly.[7]
The macro-financial context is having an impact on both the financial and non-financial risks that banks are facing.
Let me start by looking at the financial risks, focusing first of all on credit risk. Currently, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio stands close to historical lows at 2.3%. However, corporate insolvencies are on the rise, potentially leading to higher credit risk. Moreover, downside risks may materialise in sectors that are particularly sensitive to current macroeconomic trends.
In fact, we can see early signs of weakening asset quality, particularly in vulnerable sectors, such as commercial real estate, and in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Worryingly, banks’ provisions do not appear to sufficiently reflect downside risks, confirming some persistent shortcomings in their International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) provisioning frameworks.
Against this backdrop, European banking supervision made banks’ credit risk management one of its key supervisory priorities for 2025-27, spurring on banks to pay close attention to the bread and butter task of sound credit risk management.
For example, this means that instead of kicking the can down the road, banks should recognise deteriorations in asset quality in a timely manner and ensure their provisioning develops in lockstep with decreasing asset quality.
Banks are also advised to identify borrowers that may experience structural repayment difficulties in sectors of the economy that are particularly sensitive to current macroeconomic trends.That is also why we are continuing our supervisory work on vulnerable sectors, by focusing for instance on banks’ preparedness in dealing with potential economic deterioration across the full value chain of the automotive sector.
Moving on to non-financial risks, let me stress that – especially in the current risk environment – strong governance and sound risk culture are crucially important.[8]Banks’ management bodies must ensure the effective and prudent management of their bank[9], and are therefore ultimately responsible for ensuring that banks are prepared for the challenges of today’s risk landscape.
However, good governance, financial resilience and sound risk management are essential but not enough in themselves to ensure that banks always remain at the service of the economy. To do so, they must also be operationally resilient. Why is that?
Let’s take the example of Amsterdam Trade Bank (ATB), which filed for bankruptcy even though it had ample capital and liquidity. What went wrong? Due to sanctions, ATB had lost access to its IT systems, which were run by third-party providers. There were no adequate contingency arrangements in place, so this well-capitalised, liquid, but operationally insufficiently resilient bank had to close.
Another example is last summer’s CrowdStrike incident, which caused the operating system of a major provider to crash, displaying the so-called blue screen of death. This led to significant disruptions across sectors, including banks.
Lastly, we can also see that the number of significant cyber incidents reported to the ECB more than doubled between 2022 and 2024.
Worryingly, we see a clear increase in attacks on third-party providers to which banks have outsourced certain services. Let me be clear: there are very good reasons for banks to outsource certain activities. For example, if they want to take advantage of cost efficiencies, or be more agile and optimise their own resources and expertise.[10]However, as the rising number of cyber incidents highlights, outsourcing also comes with risks that banks should assess thoroughly to ensure business continuity. Considering that European banks are highly dependent on third-party providers, particular vigilance is needed, especially in times of rapid geopolitical change. Banks may want to consider revisiting past risk management decisions when (re-)assessing their outsourcing arrangements.
The examples that I just mentioned illustrate a fundamental point: in times of increasing digitalisation and geopolitical tensions which are fuelling cyberattacks, operational resilience is more important than ever.
However, unlike financial resilience, operational resilience can’t be built up by accumulating Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1). Instead, boosting operational resilience requires investment. Given the current rise in banks’ profitability, the time is right to continue investing in operational resilience. The more banks invest with strategic foresight, the better they will be operationally prepared if and when a cyberattack hits, for example.
Moreover, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which became applicable in the EU earlier this year, will help to further boost operational resilience as it provides a robust framework that requires banks to foster a culture of continuous IT and cyber risk management.[11]
What’s more, neither cyber risks nor other risks stop at borders. Given the interconnectedness of the international financial system, international cooperation is vitally important. The good news is that we have well-established existing global institutions and fora such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board and the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System, which remain essential for financial stability, especially in the current risk context.
Hence, as we navigate through a complex risk environment with heightened uncertainties, vigilance, prudence and resilience are more important than ever. But resilience – whether financial or operational – isn’t just about protecting banks from shocks. It’s also a foundation for long-term competitiveness. A bank that is robust in times of crisis is also a bank that is robust at all times so that it can invest and compete to the benefit households and firms.
Competitiveness and financial sector resilience are closely interlinked
And this brings us to a broader question in the debate on competitiveness: how does one ensure a strong and competitive banking sector without compromising financial stability?
Let me be clear: framing financial stability and competitiveness as opposing forces is a fundamental misconception. Evidence shows that stronger, better capitalised banks are more competitive and – most importantly – better equipped to lend to the real economy.[12]Impact assessments of the post-crisis reforms in the banking sector show that the benefits clearly outweigh any potential unintended side effects.[13]Hence, competitiveness and financial sector resilience are closely interlinked. Neither can exist without the other.
Having said that, we generally support simplifying the regulatory framework where possible, as long as the current level of resilience of the banking sector is maintained and any changes are based on prior, sound impact assessments and cost-benefit analyses. After all, if we all agree that it only makes sense to legislate after solid ex ante impact assessments and sound analyses show that the benefits of certain rules outweigh their costs, then it must make just as much sense to rigorously perform these same assessments and analyses before scrapping those very same rules.
We must ensure that any short-term gains in simplification do not actually result in any long-term loss of resilience prudently built up over the last decade. We also need to ensure that simplification efforts do not leave pockets of risk unaddressed.
Let me illustrate this with an example. As prudential supervisors, our true north is that no material risk remains unaddressed. An important precondition for banks to be able to prudently manage their risks is that they have accurate risk data and information from their customers. The financial risks stemming from the ongoing climate and nature crises are no exception to that principle. It is therefore vitally important that any attempts to simplify sustainability reporting for companies do not result in critically important data points needed by banks to adequately manage their climate and nature-related risks no longer being disclosed in a harmonised manner. If this were to happen, banks would either no longer be able to conduct adequate risk management, or they would have to resort to requiring additional data from their clients on top of the current regulatory regime, which would be burdensome both for banks and their clients.
The economist Hyman Minsky wisely stated that, as memories of past crises fade, attitudes towards regulation change. Let me add that if such attitudes lead to confusing simplification and deregulation, memories of past crises could return with a vengeance.
The last thing we should do, especially as we go through times of high uncertainty, is to let our guard down as regards resilience and hamper banks’ ability to manage their risks, thinking that “this time will be different’’, the phrase so poignantly coined in Rogoff’s and Reinhard’s “Eight Centuries of Financial Folly”.[14]Let us, for once, avoid such folly and sidestep that all-too-attractive trap.
Instead, let me point to an often overlooked yet crucially important aspect that has significant simplification potential and does not come at the expense of resilience: a primary root cause of complexity in the European framework lies in the persistent fragmentation of rules at national level. For example, many facets of the current prudential framework do not actually consist of a single European regulation but of a patchwork of nationally transposed directives. To truly reduce complexity, we need more harmonisation at EU level through directly applicable regulations which would achieve a truly unified single rulebook. I would even go as far as to say that a more integrated and European approach is the most effective way forward to ensure that our regulatory framework is simpler and more effective. Financial markets would also greatly benefit from the harmonisation of corporate insolvency rules, accounting frameworks and securities laws, as well as from better disclosure of financial information by EU corporates. To make progress in these areas, alternatives methods could be envisaged, such as the introduction of a 28th regime, which would be a practical and very welcome intermediate step towards further harmonisation within the EU.
A completed banking union, including the establishment of a European deposit insurance scheme and a fully integrated capital markets union, would help eliminate barriers that still hinder market integration and would ensure that the financial system fosters both stability and growth. The path to greater competitiveness does not therefore lie in deregulation but in further European integration.
Moreover, as far as European banking supervision is concerned, we continuously apply a risk-based approach to simplify and reduce complexity and cost factors that unduly inhibit our task of keeping banks sound.
One example of our drive for “simplification without compromising resilience” is the comprehensive reform of our annual health check of banks, the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, which we recently made leaner, more risk based and more efficient.
The recent, fast-track approval process for standardised securitisations is another excellent example of how, in close dialogue with the industry, processes can be simplified within the existing regulatory framework. By leveraging product standardisation for sufficiently simple significant risk transfer transactions, the fast-track process will lead to efficiency gains without – crucially – weakening our focus on relevant risks. I sincerely hope that together we can identify and pursue more initiatives of this kind.
We will also continue to reduce processing times by making better use of supervisory technology tools that use cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence. For example, since March 2023 we have been machine reading and pre-screening all our fit and proper applications, which speeds up supervisory assessments and, in turn, the responsiveness to banks.[15]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The progress made over the past decade has made European banks more resilient. Banks have evolved from shock propagators to shock absorbers.
As we navigate through the storms brewing over today’s increasingly complex risk landscape, stable banks are more important than ever.
Rolling back on safety and soundness would not only undermine financial stability but also weaken banks’ ability to finance the real economy.
Does that mean that there is no room for regulatory simplification? Does it mean that there is no room for any efficiency gains in the way we supervise? Of course not.
But let us stay on course while we explore how to simplify and harmonise the regulatory framework.
Let us stay on course while we continue to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our supervision.
And let us stay on course in ensuring that the European banking system remains resilient.
Because resilient banks are nothing less than the bedrock of competitiveness and growth.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at 25th ""ECB and Its Watchers"" conference organised by the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.
Frankfurt am Main, 12 March 2025
Paul Valéry wrote that “the trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be”.
Our expectations have indeed been swept aside in the last few years, and in the last few weeks in particular.
Established certainties about the international order have been upended. Some alliances have become strained while others have drawn closer. We have seen political decisions that would have been unthinkable only a few months ago.
The level of uncertainty we are facing is exceptionally high.
An index of trade policy uncertainty currently stands at close to 350, more than six times its average value since 2021.[1]And indicators of geopolitical risk stand at levels not seen since the Cold War, outside of wars and major terrorist attacks.[2]
This new environment raises fundamental questions for monetary policy. How can we deliver price stability in a new geopolitical era?
Our strategy assessment is ongoing, as you know, and I will naturally not cover every issue in my speech today. I will focus on the factors I consider to be particularly relevant in this new era.
I will ask three questions: how is the environment in which we operate changing? What do these changes imply for our reaction function? And what do the changes imply for our policy communication?
My main message is that in an environment of uncertainty, a strong commitment to maintaining price stability over the medium term is more important than ever.
This commitment will require agility to respond to new shocks, albeit within a well-defined framework that limits short-sighted reactions and unbridled discretion.
As a result, we will need to continue steering the public’s expectations. People will be looking to us – and other policymakers – to understand how we will navigate this more volatile era and help reduce, rather than amplify, uncertainty.
So, agility needs to be combined with clarity. Even when we cannot provide certainty about the rate path, we can provide clarity about our reaction function.
The environment
When we last reviewed our strategy, the main challenge we faced was a prolonged environment of too-low inflation. Although the review provided lessons that are relevant under any circumstances, its main focus was on understanding the causes of too-low inflation and how to ensure that it did not become embedded.
The environment we are facing now is a different one. Three key changes stand out.
First, the direction of shocks is much harder to predict.
In the decade before our last strategy review, we faced a range of structural and cyclical forces that were almost uniformly disinflationary. Now, we are seeing notable shifts in the drivers of inflation.
We still face structural factors like ageing and digitalisation that will probably be disinflationary in the coming years.[3]But we are also now facing new, two-sided shocks – mainly linked to trade and defence, as well as climate change – which can amplify or counteract the existing forces.
Trade fragmentation[4]and higher defence spending in a capacity-constrained sector could in principle push up inflation. Yet US tariffs could also lower demand for EU exports and redirect excess capacity from China into Europe, which could push inflation down.
Second, the size of the shocks to inflation could potentially change.
In the period from the great financial crisis to our last strategy review, we faced some very large negative shocks to growth. The effect of these shocks on inflation, however, took time to materialise. We saw a slow-moving downward drift in inflation that eventually seeped into inflation expectations.
But looking ahead, shocks might feed into inflation more directly and increase volatility. And this risk may be particularly acute for the euro area, as we are highly exposed to some of the new types of shock.
For example, the euro area is very open to trade and part of integrated supply chains. Hence, trade fragmentation is likely to lead to larger, more disruptive relative price changes.[5]In a similar vein, the euro area is highly dependent on energy imports.[6]Geopolitical risks are likely to drive greater volatility in exchange rates and energy and commodity prices, as we have seen in recent weeks.
Third, if the shocks do become larger, the persistence of inflation could in some circumstances be greater.
One feature of the recent inflation shock was an increase in the frequency of price changes.[7]This can lead to a steepening of the Phillips curve and, more generally, to a proportionally stronger impact of large shocks on inflation. A model developed at the ECB suggests that inflation behaves in a visibly non-linear way: it reacts disproportionately more strongly to large shocks, whereas small shocks trigger no significant reactions.[8]
If such state-dependent pricing becomes standard when the economy is hit by large shocks, but the frequency of wage-setting remains below that of price adjustment, we could see inflation becoming more persistent.[9]Large shocks would lead to a faster pass-through to inflation, and then wages would have to catch up with prices in a staggered way.
As an illustration, energy inflation peaked in October 2022, while services inflation only peaked in July 2023 and is still being pushed up by past shocks today, mainly through their delayed impact on wage adjustments.
In this environment of more uncertain, larger and possibly more persistent shocks, the way we have formulated our inflation target matters – that is, we aim for 2% inflation, our target is symmetric and we work to achieve it over the medium term.
This symmetric target has served us well during the recent inflation surge, helping to coordinate expectations and guide the inflation process back down towards 2%.
But the formulation does not mean that headline inflation will always be at 2%, which is impossible in the kind of environment we are facing now. It means that, regardless of the shocks we face, we must set our policy appropriately so that inflation isalways converging back towards 2% over the medium term.
So, how can we do that? This brings me to the second area: the reaction function.
The reaction function
Our reaction function has always been state-dependent. In other words, policy should react differently depending on the context and the origin, size and persistence of shocks.
Our medium-term orientation enables us to avoid reacting to small or passing shocks that will have faded by the time the effects of a policy change kick in. And it allows us to flexibly adjust the horizon within which we must return inflation to target.
Classically, monetary policy reacts more forcefully to demand shocks where output and inflation move together, and “looks through” or reacts less to supply shocks that push output and inflation in opposite directions – if they are sufficiently small and transitory.
Empirical evidence based on the last two decades finds that the ECB has largely followed this prescription. Generally, it has reacted more strongly to demand shocks than to supply shocks. But it has responded to supply shocks more forcefully when these shocks were persistent and inflation was high.[10]
The new environment requires us to emphasise two factors.
The first is the anchoring of inflation expectations.
For the ECB, “looking through” has always been conditional on inflation expectations remaining well anchored. The recent inflation surge has confirmed just how critical maintaining a strong anchoring is to successfully navigate a more volatile world.
Our analysis finds that, if inflation expectations had been as poorly anchored as they were in the 1970s, policy rates would have had to rise to 8% at the peak of the recent tightening cycle to tame inflation, with very high costs for the economy.[11]With well-anchored expectations, recent disinflation has instead been achieved at a relatively low cost compared with similar episodes in the past.[12]
This experience can, in some ways, give us confidence for the challenges ahead: the relative stability of longer-term inflation expectations during a massive inflation surge suggests that our inflation target has a high degree of credibility, which was reinforced by the decisive actions we took to keep inflation expectations anchored.[13]
At the same time, our starting point for the recent inflation episode was a decade of too-low inflation and correspondingly subdued inflation expectations. This meant the public were initially inattentive to inflation and took time to update their views.
But there is some evidence that public awareness has been awakened by recent experience. Once consumers took notice of rising inflation, their inflation perceptions responded quickly but reduced more sluggishly when inflation started to fall. This sluggish response has contributed to the slow adjustment of consumer inflation expectations, especially one year ahead.
We will only know through careful observation how long these memories will last, and consequently how sensitive inflation expectations will be to new shocks. But in all scenarios, close monitoring of inflation expectations – across markets, analysts, forecasters, households and firms – will be central to our policy reaction function.
Once the anchoring of inflation expectations is assured, the second factor we need to assess is how the current environment affects the optimal policy reaction to different type of shocks.
If the Phillips curve becomes steeper at higher levels of inflation, meaning inflation responds faster to changes in activity, then it should also be easier for monetary policy to bring inflation down without imposing heavy costs on the economy. This would weaken one of the main rationales for “looking through” large supply shocks.[14]
At the same time, there may be risks in generalising from recent experience where disinflation was relatively painless.
Alongside well-anchored inflation expectations, the relatively low “sacrifice ratio” during this disinflation episode may reflect a unique set of conditions that will not be applicable to future shocks. In particular, the fact that we faced a series of negative shocks to income reduced the extent to which demand needed to be dampened by monetary tightening.[15]
Any future shocks we face – such as energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions or a large increase in spending on defence or infrastructure – will therefore have to be assessed through this framework.
All told, simple policy prescriptions will not be appropriate in the environment we now face. Within a well-articulated strategy and an unwavering commitment to price stability, we will need to retain agility to respond to complex circumstances as they arise.
This has implications for our policy communication, which brings me to the third area.
Policy communication
Maintaining agility affects how we can talk about the future. And this applies particularly to our ability to give detailed guidance on the future path of interest rates.
Forward guidance about the rate path is particularly useful under two circumstances.
First, when the economy is faced with one-sided, persistent shocks pushing it towards the effective lower bound. In this setting, it gives the public confidence that monetary policy will be sufficiently persistent to dislodge those shocks and deliver on its target, while also helping insulate monetary conditions from spillovers from abroad.
These benefits were all visible in the euro area from 2013 onwards when we first introduced rate forward guidance.
Second, forward guidance can be useful when shocks become two-sided following a long time at the lower bound. In this case, it can help to lay out the conditions for rate lift-off in a way that hedges against false positives and prevents a premature tightening, and thereby reduces uncertainty about the future path of rates.
However, one of the lessons of the recent period is that such guidance can become less helpful when uncertainty about the nature of the shocks is rising. In particular, some of the lift-off criteria we applied to our 2021 rate forward guidance were tied to the baseline inflation projections, but the projections were slow in catching on to the reality of a much more persistent inflation shock.
The combination of factors that created this shock – a worldwide pandemic producing bottlenecks in various sectors upon reopening and a major energy crisis – had not been seen since the end of the World War One. But with hindsight, it would have been beneficial in our forward guidance to explicitly account for the risks and uncertainty surrounding the baseline.
A general conclusion emerges: when the size and distribution of shocks becomes highly uncertain, we cannot provide certainty by committing to a particular rate path. Otherwise, forward guidance may constrain policy agility in the face of abrupt changes to the inflation environment.
But we can provide clarity about our reaction function. We can still help the public to understand how we will navigate the new environment.
First, we can clarify how we are likely to be affected by different states of the world.
Since the pandemic, the ECB has been making greater use of scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis precisely to make our policy more robust to changing circumstances. These exercises, together with our discussion of the balance of risks, are designed to ensure that policymaking can remain forward-looking and stay ahead of the shocks to come.
At present, we are considering various scenarios related to tariffs and fiscal policy changes, and what they will imply for growth and inflation.[16]
Second, we can clarify what kind of data we will look at to make our decisions, which helps the public to distinguish signals from noise. This is why in March 2023 we set out three key inputs for policy decisions: the inflation outlook – comprising both the baseline and risks around it – the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
In the early phase of our rate tightening, before these criteria were introduced, we saw large monetary policy shocks – linked both to rate decisions and indications on future rates – as markets were looking for orientation. But after March 2023, market moves were less pronounced despite similar levels of interest rate uncertainty, which suggests that the markets better understood our reaction function.
We also saw increased sensitivity to new data releases in the early tightening phase. But this diminished as markets understood which data we were focusing on and, especially, that data dependence should not be confused with “data-point dependence”.[17]
The lesson I draw is that laying out a clear reaction function is critical to tempering volatility in a world of exceptional uncertainty. The public must understand the distribution of possible outcomes ahead and how the central bank will react once it is sufficiently confident about which scenario it is facing.
In this way, clarity on the reaction function can be seen as providingframework guidance– i.e. a type of guidance that comes from the discipline implicit in a monetary policy framework – without pre-committing to any particular rate path, as the latter would excessively constrain agility.
The three inputs we are currently using are designed to deliver robust policy in the face of the particular constellation of shocks that have hit the euro in recent years, especially the staggered pass-through of a large inflation surge to wages. Whether we continue to use those same inputs in future will depend on the nature of the shocks that confront us.
Our strategy assessment should nonetheless commit to integrating risk and uncertainty about key factors into our reaction function. The data we draw on should capture not only our central projection for the economy, but also the uncertainty surrounding that projection and a rich, diverse set of risks.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Thomas Jefferson said that “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”. The same can be said of stability.
Maintaining stability in a new era will be a formidable task. It will require an absolute commitment to our inflation target, the ability to parse which types of shocks will require a monetary reaction and the agility to react appropriately.
Our response to the recent inflation episode should give the public confidence that we will always do whatever is necessary to deliver price stability – and that our policy frameworks can adapt to new circumstances.
Central bankers will need to show agility to adjust their stance and their tools to changing circumstances, and they will need intellectual curiosity to challenge established principles and conventional wisdom."

Keynote speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Bank of England’s 2025 BEAR Conference
London, 25 February 2025
Over the past few years, global bond investors have fundamentally reappraised the expected future course of monetary policy.
Even as inflation has receded and policy restriction has been dialled back, current market prices suggest that maintaining price stability will require higher real interest rates in the future than before the pandemic.
In my remarks today, I will argue that the shift in market expectations about the level of r* – the rate to which the economy is expected to converge in the long run once current shocks have run their course – is consistent with two sets of observations.
The first is that the era during which risks to inflation have persistently been to the downside is likely to have come to an end.
Growing geopolitical fragmentation, climate change and labour scarcity pose measurable upside risks to inflation over the medium to long term. This is especially true as the recent inflation surge may have permanently scarred consumers’ inflation expectations and may have lowered the bar for firms to pass through adverse cost-push shocks to consumer prices.
The second observation is that we are transitioning from a global “savings glut” towards a global “bond glut”.
Persistently large fiscal deficits and central bank balance sheet normalisation are gradually reducing the safety and liquidity premia that investors have long been willing to pay to hold scarce government bonds. The fall in the “convenience yield”, in turn, reverses a key factor that had contributed to the decline in real long-term interest rates, and hence r*, during the 2010s.
The implications for monetary policy are threefold.
First, a higher r* calls for careful monitoring of when monetary policy ceases to be restrictive. Second, central bank balance sheet policies may themselves affect the level of r* through the convenience yield, making them potentially less effective than previously thought. Third, because central bank reserves also offer convenience services to banks, it is optimal to provide reserves elastically on demand as quantitative tightening reduces excess liquidity.
Upward shift in r* signals lasting change in the inflation regime
Starting in 2021, long-term government bond yields rose measurably across advanced economies. Today, the ten-year yield of a German government bond is about two and a half percentage points higher than in late 2021 (Slide 2, left-hand side).
What is remarkable about the rise in nominal bond yields in the euro area over this period is that it was not driven by a change in inflation compensation. Investors’ views about future inflation prospects are broadly the same today as they were three years ago (Slide 2, right-hand side).
Rather, nominal interest rates rose becauserealinterest rates increased. Euro area real long-term rates are now trading at a level that is substantially higher than the level prevailing during most of the post-2008 global financial crisis period (Slide 3, left-hand side).
Part of the rise in real long-term interest rates is a mechanical response to the tightening of monetary policy.
Long-term interest rates are an average of expected short-term interest rates over the lifetime of the bond, plus a term premium. So, when we raised our key policy rates in response to the surge in inflation, the average real rate expected to prevail over the next ten years increased.[1]
What is more striking, however, is that investors also fundamentally revised the real short-term rate expected to prevail once inflation has sustainably returned to our target. This rate is typically taken as a proxy for the natural rate of interest, or r*.
The real one-year rate expected in four years (1y4y), for example, is now at the highest level since the sovereign debt crisis (Slide 3, right-hand side). Even at very distant horizons, such as in nine years, the expected real short-term rate (1y9y) has increased measurably in recent years.
To a significant extent, these developments reflect a genuine reappraisal of the real equilibrium interest rate that is consistent with our 2% inflation target. A rise in the term premium, which is the excess return investors demand for the uncertainty surrounding the future interest rate path, can explain less than half of the change in the real 1y4y rate.[2]
These forward rates have also remained surprisingly stable since 2023, with a standard deviation of around just 15 basis points, despite the measurable decline in inflation, the protracted weakness in aggregate demand and the series of structural headwinds facing the euro area.
We are seeing a similar upward shift in model-based estimates of r*. According to estimates by ECB economists, the natural rate of interest in the euro area has increased appreciably over the past two years, and even more so than what market-based real forward rates would suggest (Slide 4).[3]
This result is robust across many models and even holds when accounting for the significant uncertainty surrounding these estimates. In other words, for drawing conclusions about the directional change of r* from the rise in market and model-based measures, the actual ratelevelis largely irrelevant.
What matters is the direction of travel. And that is unambiguous: we are unlikely to return to the pre-pandemic macroeconomic environment in which central banks had to bring real rates into deeply negative territory to deliver on their price stability mandate. This suggests that the nature of the inflation process is likely to have changed lastingly.
Real interest rates are only loosely tied to trend growth
Why do markets expect such a trend reversal for real interest rates in the euro area?
One answer is that some of the forces that weighed on inflation during the 2010s are now reversing.
Globalisation is a case in point. The integration of China and other emerging market economies into the global production network and the broad-based decline in tariff and non-tariff barriers were important factors reducing price pressures in advanced economies over several decades.[4]
Today, protectionist policies, the weaponisation of critical raw materials and geopolitical fragmentation are increasingly dismantling the foundations on which trade improved the welfare of consumers worldwide.
These forces can be expected to have first-order effects on inflation.
European gas prices, for example, are up by 65% compared with a year ago despite the significant decline over recent days. Oil prices, too, have increased since September of last year, in part reflecting the marked depreciation of the euro.
While commodity prices are inherently volatile, and may reverse quickly, other deglobalisation factors, such as reshoring and the lengthening of supply chains, are likely to increase price pressures more lastingly.
And yet, the persistent rise in real forward rates poses a conundrum in the euro area.
The reason is that increases in long-term real interest rates are typically thought of as being associated with improvements on the supply side of the economy, such as productivity growth, the labour force and the capital stock.
At present, however, these factors do not point towards an increase in r* in the euro area.
Potential growth has generally been revised lower, not higher, as many of the factors currently holding back consumption and especially investment are likely to be structural in nature, such as a rapidly ageing population and deteriorating competitiveness.
The weak link between the structural factors driving potential growth and r* is, however, not exceptional from a historical perspective.
Indeed, over time there has been little evidence of a stable relationship between real interest rates and drivers of potential growth, such as demographics and productivity.[5]They have had the expected relationship in some subsamples but not in others.[6]
Similarly, in the most popular framework for estimating r*, the seminal model by Laubach and Williams, potential growth has played an increasingly subordinated role in explaining why the natural rate of interest has remained at a depressed level in the United States following the global financial crisis (Slide 5, left-hand side).[7]
Rather, the persistence in the decline in r* is explained to a large extent by a residual factor, which lacks economic interpretation.
Moreover, if growth was the main driver of r*, then one would expect all real rates in the economy to adjust in a similar way. But while real rates on safe assets have declined since the early 1990s, the return on private capital has remained relatively constant.[8]
Decline in the convenience yield is pushing r* up
A growing body of research attempts to reconcile these puzzles. Many studies attribute a significant role to the money-like convenience services that safe and liquid assets, such as government bonds, provide to market participants.
The yield that investors are willing to forgo in equilibrium for these services is what economists call the “convenience yield”.[9]
This yield, in turn, critically depends on the net supply of safe assets: When these are scarce, investors are willing to pay a premium to hold them, depressing the real equilibrium rate of interest. And when they are abundant, the premium falls, putting upward pressure on r*.
New research by economists at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shows how incorporating the convenience yield into the Laubach and Williams framework significantly improves the explanatory power of the model.[10]
In fact, the convenience yield can explain most of the residual factor and is estimated to have caused a large part of the secular decline in the real natural rate in the United States (Slide 5, right-hand side).
Liquidity requirements that regulators imposed on banks in the wake of the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policies and the integration of many large emerging market economies into the global economy have led to an unprecedented increase in the demand for safe and liquid assets, driving up their convenience yield.[11]
These findings are in line with earlier research showing that the convenience yield has played an equally important role in depressing the real equilibrium rate in many other advanced economies, including the euro area, during the 2010s.[12]
This process is now reversing. According to the work by the Federal Reserve economists, r* has recently increased visibly, contrary to what the model without a convenience yield would suggest.
Asset swap spreads are a good indicator of the convenience yield. Both interest rate swaps and government bonds are essentially risk-free assets, so they should in principle yield the same return.
For a long time, this has been the case: before the start of quantitative easing (QE) in the euro area in 2015, the spread between a ten-year German Bund and a swap of equivalent maturity was close to zero on average (Slide 6, left-hand side).
Over time, however, with the start of QE and the parallel fiscal consolidation by governments reducing the net supply of government bonds in the market, the premium that investors were willing to pay to secure their convenience services rose measurably. At the peak, ten-year Bunds were trading nearly 80 basis points below swap rates.
But since about mid-2022 the asset swap spread has persistently narrowed. In October of last year it turned positive for the first time in ten years, and it now stands close to the pre-QE average again.
Other measures of the convenience yield paint a similar picture. The spread between ten-year bonds issued by the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) and German Bunds has narrowed from about-80 basis points in October 2022 to just -30 basis points today (Slide 6, right-hand side).[13]
Furthermore, in the repo market, we have observed a steady and measurable rise in overnight rates and a convergence across collateral classes (Slide 7, left-hand side).[14]
Over the past few years, transactions secured by German government collateral, in particular, were trading at a significant premium over others. This premium has declined considerably, reflecting a reduction in collateral scarcity.
Finally, in the United States, the spread between AAA corporate bonds and US Treasuries has declined from almost 100 basis points in 2022 to 40 basis points today (Slide 7, right-hand side). It currently stands close to its historical low.
Global savings glut has turned into a global bond glut
All this suggests that, today, market participants value the liquidity and safety services of government bonds less than they did in the past, as the net supply of government bonds has increased and continues to increase at a notable pace.
In Germany and the United States, for example, the sovereign bond free float as a share of the outstanding volume has increased by more than ten percentage points over the past three years (Slide 8, left-hand side). It is projected to steadily increase further in the coming years.
So, the global savings glut appears to have turned into a global bond glut, which reduces the marginal benefit of holding government bonds.
There are several factors contributing to the rise in the bond free float.[15]
First, and most importantly, net borrowing by governments remains substantial. The public deficit is estimated to have been around 5% of GDP across advanced economies last year, and it is expected to decline only marginally in the coming years (Slide 8, right-hand side).
Second, rising geopolitical fragmentation is likely to be contributing to a drop in demand for government bonds in some parts of the world.
In the United States, for example, there has been a marked decline in the share of foreign official holdings of US Treasury securities since the global financial crisis (Slide 9, left-hand side). It is now at its lowest level in more than 20 years.[16]The US Administration’s attempt to reduce the current account deficit is bound to further depress foreign holdings of US Treasuries.
Third, central banks are in the process of normalising their balance sheets (Slide 9, right-hand side). Unlike when central banks announced large-scale asset purchases, the effects of quantitative tightening (QT) on yields are likely to materialise only over time, as many central banks take a gradual approach when reducing the size of their balance sheets.
Higher r* calls for cautious approach to rate easing
These developments have three important implications for monetary policy.
One is that central banks are dialling back policy restriction in an environment in which structural factors are putting upward pressure on the real equilibrium rate. Recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), for example, suggests that a fall in the convenience yield to pre-2000 average levels could raise natural rates by about 70 basis points.[17]
While a significant part of these effects may have already materialised, other factors could push real rates up further over the medium term. The IMF projects that, in the coming years, overall global investment – public and private – will reach the highest share of GDP since the 1980s, also reflecting borrowing needs associated with the digital and green transitions as well as defence spending.
Recent global initiatives aimed at boosting the development and use of artificial intelligence underscore these projections. Overall, these forces may well be larger than those that continue to weigh on the real equilibrium rate, such as an ageing population.
Central banks, therefore, need to proceed cautiously. We do not fully understand how the pervasive changes to our economies are affecting the steady state, or what the path to the new steady state will look like.
In this environment, the most appropriate way to conduct monetary policy is to look at the incoming data to assess how fast, and to what extent, changes to our key policy rates are being transmitted to the economy.
For the euro area, this assessment suggests that, over the past year, the degree of policy restraint has declined appreciably – to a point where we can no longer say with confidence that our policy is restrictive.
According to the most recent bank lending survey, for example, 90% of banks say that the general level of interest rates has no impact on the demand for corporate loans, with 8% saying that it contributes to boosting credit demand (Slide 10, left-hand side). This is a marked shift from a year ago when a third of all banks reported that interest rates were weighing on credit demand.
For mortgages, the evidence is even more striking. Today almost half of the banks report that the level of interest rates supports loan demand, while a year ago more than 40% said the opposite. As a result, a net 42% of banks report an increase in the demand for mortgages, close to the historical high.
Survey evidence is gradually showing up in actual lending data. Credit to firms expanded by 1.5% in December, the highest rate in a year and a half, and credit to households for house purchases grew by 1.1% (Slide 10, right-hand side).
Strong bank balance sheets are contributing to the recovery and, given the lags in policy transmission, further easing is still in the pipeline.
Lending conditions are also relatively favourable from the perspective of borrowers. The spread between the composite cost of borrowing for households and sovereign bond yields is well below the level seen over most of the 2010s and is now close to the historical average (Slide 11).[18]
And while some maturing loans from the period of very low interest rates will still need to be refinanced at higher rates, over time this debt has declined in real terms and interest payments as a fraction of net income are buffered by rising nominal wages.
Overall, therefore, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that current financing conditions are materially holding back consumption and investment. The fact that growth remains subdued cannot and should not be taken as evidence that policy is restrictive.
As the ECB’s most recent corporate telephone survey suggests, the continued weakness in manufacturing is increasingly viewed by firms as structural, reflecting a combination of high energy and labour costs, an overly inhibitive and uncertain regulatory environment and increased import competition, especially from China.[19]
Such structural headwinds reduce the economy’s sensitivity to changes in monetary policy.
QE’s impact on r* is reducing its effectiveness
The second implication from the impact of the convenience yield on r* is related to the use of balance sheet policies.
If QE raises the convenience yield by reducing the net supply of government bonds, it may ultimately lower the real equilibrium interest rate. Importantly, this channel – the convenience yield channel – is distinct from the term premium channel.[20]
So, doing QE could be like chasing a moving target.
It reduces long-run rates by compressing the term premium.[21]But by making investors willing to pay a higher safety premium when the supply of safe assets shrinks, it may also reduce the interest rate level below which monetary policy stimulates growth and inflation.
This can also be seen by looking at how QE changes the balance of savings and investments. Fiscal deficits absorb private savings and thereby increase r*. By doing QE, central banks absorb fiscal deficits and thereby lower r*.
In other words, central bank balance sheet policies may be less effective than previously thought.[22]This could be an additional factor explaining why large-scale asset purchases did not succeed in bringing inflation back to 2% before the pandemic.
Of course, the same logic holds true when central banks reduce their balance sheets.
If QE contributed to depressing r*, QT will raise it. Any rise in real rates may then be less consequential for growth and inflation. It would then be misguided to compensate for higher long-term interest rates resulting from QT with lower short-term rates.
This is indeed what recent research suggests: QT announcements tend to cause a significant decline in the convenience yield of safe assets.[23]
There is one caveat, however.
QE and QT are implemented by issuing and absorbing central bank reserves, which themselves are safe assets – in fact, reserves are the economy’s ultimate safe asset because they are free of liquidity and interest rate risk.[24]
Banks therefore highly value the convenience services of central bank reserves. So, when evaluating the effects of central bank balance sheet policies on r*, it is necessary to consider both the asset and liability side.
Research by economists from the Bank of England does exactly that.[25]They show that the effects of QT on the real equilibrium rate depend on the relative strength of two factors.
One is the effect on thebondconvenience yield, which causes r* to rise as the supply of government bonds increases.
The other is the effect on the convenience yield ofreserves. That effect is highly non-linear: when reserves are scarce, banks are willing to pay a high mark-up on wholesale interest rates, as was evident in the United States in 2019 when repo rates surged strongly.
So, if QT leads to a scarcity of reserves, it may cause the overall convenience yield to rise, and hence equilibrium rates to fall.
Convenience of reserves and the ECB’s operational framework
At the ECB, we took this factor into account when we reviewed our operational framework last year.[26]This is the third implication for monetary policy.
The new framework allows banks to demand as many reserves as they find optimal at a spread that is 15 basis points above the rate which the ECB pays to banks when they deposit their excess reserves with us. So, the opportunity cost of holding reserves is comparatively small, given the convenience services reserves provide to banks.
In addition, our framework allows banks themselves to generate an increase in safe assets – by pledging non-high quality liquid assets (non-HQLA) in our lending operations.In doing so, banks on average generate € 0.92 of net HQLA for every euro that they borrow from the Eurosystem.[27]
Our framework therefore recognises that years of crises, more stringent regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than they historically have done.
Supplying central bank reserves elastically will ensure that reserves will not become scarce as balance sheet normalisation proceeds. And if banks access our standard refinancing operations when they are in need of liquidity, they will also not have to adjust their lending activities in response to the decline in reserves, as is sometimes feared.[28]
For now, the recourse to our lending operations has been limited, as there is still ample excess liquidity. But as we transition over the coming years to a world in which reserves are less abundant, banks will increasingly start borrowing reserves via our operations.
Three ideas could be explored to make this transition as smooth as possible.
First, regular testing requirements in the counterparty framework could help ensure operational readiness while also allowing counterparties to become more comfortable with participating in our operations. A lack of operational readiness was one of the factors contributing to the March 2023 turmoil in the United States.[29]
Second, and related, obtaining central bank funding requires thorough collateral management, especially if the collateral framework is as broad as the Eurosystem’s. For non-HQLA collateral, in particular, the pricing and due diligence process can be operationally complex and time-consuming.
For this reason, central banks sometimes require counterparties to pre-position collateral to ensure that funding can be readily obtained.[30]In the euro area, some banks already pre-position collateral voluntarily, in particular non-marketable collateral which cannot be used in private repo markets (Slide 12, left-hand side).
Banks could be further encouraged to mobilise with the central bank the collateral that is eligible but currently stays idle on their balance sheets. This would increase operational readiness, mitigate financial stability risks and reduce precautionary reserve demand as banks would have higher certainty that they can access central bank liquidity at short notice.
In the Eurosystem, given its broad collateral framework, such an approach may be more effective in helping banks adapt their liquidity management to the characteristics of a demand-driven operational framework compared with a blanket requirement to pre-position collateral.
Finally, in some jurisdictions central bank operations are fully integrated into the platforms commonly used by banks to operate in private repo markets.
This offers banks a number of advantages, including seamless access to transactions with the market and with the central bank, and – depending on the design of clearing arrangements and accounting rules – it could potentially allow banks to net out their positions, thereby freeing up valuable balance sheet space.
Offering banks the possibility to access Eurosystem refinancing operations through a centrally cleared infrastructure could contribute to making our operations more economical in an environment in which dealer balance sheets are increasingly constrained (Slide 12, right-hand side).[31]
The design of such arrangements should preserve equal treatment across our diverse range of counterparties, regardless of their size, jurisdiction and business model, maintain the possibility to mobilise a broad range of collateral and be compatible with our risk control framework.
Further reflection is needed on these considerations, including a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and costs.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The shocks experienced since the pandemic led to an abrupt end of the secular downward trend in real interest rates. Whether this will be merely an interlude, or the beginning of a new era, is inherently difficult to predict.
But looking at the ongoing transformational shifts in the balance of global savings and investments, as well as at the fundamental challenges facing our societies today, higher real interest rates seem to be the most likely scenario for the future.
This has implications for our monetary policy. Central banks will need to adjust to the new environment, both to secure price stability over the medium term and to implement monetary policy efficiently.
Thank you."

Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an MNI Connect webcast
Frankfurt am Main, 18 February 2025
Today I would like to discuss the ECB’s balance sheet and its implications for our monetary policy.
In recent years, the monetary policy debate has mainly focused on our interest rate decisions. This is for good reason. In response to the biggest inflation shock in a generation, we embarked on the fastest tightening of monetary policy in the ECB’s history through rate hikes.
During this tightening phase, we used policy rates as the primary tool for setting our monetary policy stance, while normalising our balance sheet in a measured and predictable way. We initiated the gradual unwinding of our asset purchase programmes and recalibrated our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).[1]As a result, the size of our balance sheet has fallen by more than a quarter from its peak.
Policy rates remain our primary instrument and will therefore continue to attract the most attention. But we should not underestimate the important role that our balance sheet policies have played over time as a component of our overall monetary policy stance and in ensuring the smooth transmission of our monetary policy to the real economy. This still holds true today as we make our monetary policy less restrictive.
Inflation has now fallen substantially to levels close to 2%. Our latest projections foresee it converging towards our target over the medium term, and the risks to the inflation outlook – once sharply skewed to the upside – have now become more balanced.
At the same time, the euro area’s economic recovery remains weak – especially in the near term. The risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside and, if they materialise, may derail the recovery, with implications for the inflation outlook.
Against this background, the Governing Council has gradually been reducing the degree of monetary policy restriction by cutting policy rates towards neutral territory. While our direction is clear, we are very attentive to incoming information in view of the prevailing uncertainty about the economic environment. We continue to make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent basis. This gives us the option to adapt our interest rate path if necessary to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-term target.
However, given the importance of financial conditions in determining the inflation outlook, we also need to consider the role played by the reduction of our balance sheet. In the tightening phase our rate decisions and balance sheet policies complemented each other, but they are now going in opposing directions.
This divergence has important implications across at least two dimensions.
First, it contributes to a steepening of the yield curve. Our rate cuts exert downward pressure primarily at the short end of the yield curve. At the same time, the gradual runoff of our asset purchase portfolios exerts upward pressure on long-term and, to a lesser extent, intermediate yields. This has been compounded by recent spillovers from the US.[2]
Second, it may affect credit supply. Declining levels of central bank liquidity could constrain banks’ ability to extend credit, resulting in tighter credit conditions and potentially slowing down the investment and consumption that are critical for economic recovery.
In setting the policy stance, we therefore need to consider the impact of the overall set of financial conditions resulting from our interest rate and balance sheet policies. In other words, we need to strike the right balance if we are to achieve our inflation aim without an undue negative impact on incomes and employment. A rate cut has a more contained easing effect when the balance sheet is simultaneously reduced. This has implications when discussing the appropriate policy rate path.
We also need to consider the potential risks to the transmission of our monetary policy. In the past, abundant levels of liquidity have acted as a safeguard against spikes in liquidity needs that emerged regardless of where our rates stood. With this in mind, we need to carefully monitor the transition from abundant to less ample excess liquidity, mindful of the potential implications for financial stability.
Today, I would like to take stock of the ECB’s experience with balance sheet policies, explaining why they remain a vital part of our monetary policy toolbox. I will then discuss the implications of the ECB’s balance sheet for our monetary policy in the current environment.
The ECB’s experience with balance sheet policies
At the ECB, balance sheet policies have served a dual purpose over time, allowing us to deliver on our price stability mandate amid exceptionally difficult circumstances.
First, during periods when interest rates approached their effective lower bound and inflation remained below target, the ECB used asset purchases to support an accommodative monetary policy stance.
For instance, the ECB launched its asset purchase programme (APP) in 2015 to stimulate the economy and inflation at a time when deflationary threats loomed large. Asset purchases and the associated provision of central bank liquidity worked in several ways – including through the portfolio rebalancing, exchange rate and credit channels – to generate a significant upward effect on both economic activity and inflation.[3]
Second, balance sheet policies have been pivotal to ensuring the smooth transmission of our monetary policy to the real economy, in both tightening and easing phases.
At times when we were lowering our policy rates, our TLTROs, launched in 2014, provided banks with long-term funding on favourable terms to incentivise them to lend to firms and households. This led to a persistent compression in lending rates and an increase in loan volumes over time.[4]
But balance sheet policies were also instrumental in ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy at times when we were increasing our policy rates. The announcement of our Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in 2022 allowed us to embark on the fastest rate hiking cycle in our history without sparking financial fragmentation in the euro area.
Of course, the stance and transmission functions of our balance sheet policies do not operate in isolation. There can be beneficial interactions between the two.
As rates increased, for example, euro area banks had sufficient liquidity to manage any maturity mismatches that arose. This – alongside strengthened regulation and supervision – helped them to emerge unscathed from the market turbulence in March 2023 that saw the collapse of three regional banks in the United States.
The proportionate use of balance sheet policies in an evolving economic landscape
The substantial expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet required careful monitoring of potential side effects. That is why the principle of proportionality lies at the core of how we use our balance sheet instruments.[5]
In its 2021 strategy review, the Governing Council assessed that its use of balance sheet measures – alongside negative interest rates and forward guidance – had indeed been proportionate, taking into account any side effects, for instance on inequality and the financial sector.[6]
Some concerns, however, require a more nuanced perspective.
For example, there is little evidence to suggest that excessive risk appetite may be attributable to larger central bank balance sheets. If this were the case, we should have seen less risk-taking in markets as central banks began to withdraw their market footprint.
But the opposite has been the case. Today equity markets are near all-time highs. This may be due to “animal spirits”[7], which have also been observed outside periods of central bank balance sheet growth. We saw them at play, for instance, during the dot-com bubble – a period when the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio hit its historic peak and central bank balance sheets were distinctly lean.
Moreover, as the Eurosystem gradually reduces its footprint in sovereign bond markets by reducing its holdings of euro area government bonds, concerns about the size of the balance sheet are becoming less and less justified (Chart 1).[8]
Going forward, an evolving economic landscape suggests that balance sheet policies could be increasingly useful as monetary policy instruments. Let me highlight two developments that are particularly relevant here.
First, the non-bank financial sector has grown considerably over time and is becoming increasingly relevant in the funding of the real economy.
In the euro area, the financial assets of non-banks have more than doubled since the global financial crisis.[9]Compared with banks, non-banks are more responsive to monetary policy measures that influence longer-term interest rates, such as asset purchases.[10]Given that non-banks adjust their portfolios more actively in response to changes in interest rates, this also increases the need for sufficient liquidity in the system to facilitate these adjustments.
Second, geopolitical fragmentation means that the global economy is becoming more shock prone and subject to higher levels of uncertainty (Chart 2).
In this environment, we need to remember that the euro area is subject to fragmentation risk. A key lesson from the sovereign debt crisis is that balance sheet policies have been instrumental in making the euro area a more “normal” jurisdiction from the perspective of monetary policy.
As we navigate an increasingly complex economic landscape, the transition from abundant to less ample excess liquidity represents an inflection point that also requires close monitoring.
In this environment, banks’ liquidity needs are met via a broad mix of instruments under our new operational framework. These include our short-term main refinancing operations (MROs) and three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and will also include – at a later stage – structural longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio of securities.[11]
However, the decline in excess liquidity warrants careful monitoring, as it could exert additional tightening pressures on financial and financing conditions, potentially exceeding the intended policy stance.
The implications of the ECB’s balance sheet for monetary policy in the current environment
It is in this context that I would like to talk about the implications of our balance sheet for monetary policy in the current environment.
The ECB’s balance sheet has been reduced at a faster pace than those of central banks in other major economies during their tightening cycles (Chart 3). So far, much of this decline can be attributed to banks’ repayments of TLTRO loans.[12]
Looking ahead, however, any further reduction in the size of our balance sheet will stem from the gradual unwinding of our asset purchase portfolios, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.
As in the past, the normalisation of our balance sheet has implications for our monetary policy stance and the possible risks to monetary policy transmission.
Let me start with the implications for our monetary policy stance.
Our reaction function for rate decisions is built around three well-known criteria: (i) the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Inflation has fallen by around three-quarters from its peak in late 2022 (Chart 4). The disinflation process is well on track, and our staff projections see inflation averaging 2.1% this year, 1.9% next year and 2.1% in 2027.
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. In particular, the ECB’s measure of the persistent and common component of inflation (PCCI)[13]– a more forward-looking indicator of underlying inflationary pressures that tends to better predict future inflation – stood at 2.1% in December, and 2.0% when excluding energy.
Domestic inflation remains high, as wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. But our wage tracker is signalling a significant moderation in wage growth, and profits are partially buffering the impact on inflation.
It is the third leg of our reaction function – the strength of monetary policy transmission – that I would like to discuss in more detail, however.
As we cut interest rates, new borrowing for firms and households is becoming less expensive. But financing conditions continue to be tight – in part because our monetary policy remains restrictive and past rate hikes are still working their way through the economy.[14]
While credit continues to expand, lending to firms and households remains subdued by historical standards. In December, the annual growth rate of lending to firms was roughly two-thirds below its historical average.[15]Growth in housing loans increased gradually but also remained muted overall, at around one-fifth of its long-term average (Chart 5).[16]
At the same time, the recent gradual recovery in lending has not kept pace with the nominal growth of the economy, as reflected in the continued decline of the loan-to-GDP ratio (Chart 6).
While policy rates remain our primary instrument for adjusting our monetary policy stance, the normalisation of our balance sheet may also affect the stance through two key channels.
First, while our rate cuts exert downward pressure primarily at the short end of the yield curve, our quantitative tightening exerts upward pressure on long-term maturities and, to a lesser extent, intermediate ones. This serves to tighten financial conditions.[17]
Indeed, the runoff of the asset portfolios of central banks has arguably been one of several factors contributing to a steepening of sovereign yield curves in recent months –akin to a reversal of the duration risk channel previously associated with central banks through quantitative easing (Chart 7).
At its peak, the impact of current and expected Eurosystem bond holdings in our asset portfolios lowered ten-year sovereign bond yields by around 175 basis points.[18]Due to quantitative tightening, however, the easing impact has now fallen to around 75 basis points and is expected to further reduce over time (Chart 8).
According to ECB research, an expected€1 trillion reduction in bond holdings may raise long-term risk-free interest rates by about 35 basis points (Chart 9).[19]
Second, an environment marked by declining levels of central bank liquidity may constrain banks’ ability to extend credit.
Research documents the strong relationship between loan supply and structural sources of liquidity, such as reserves obtained through credit easing programmes or those injected through quantitative easing interventions.
More specifically, a €1 change in non-borrowed reserves or credit easing reserves is associated with a corresponding change in credit of approximately 15 cents or 10 cents respectively.[20]In other words, a €500 billion drop in non-borrowed reserves – similar to the one expected in 2025 as a result of the decline in our APP and PEPP holdings – is associated with a €75 billion decline in credit supply, equivalent to about 0.6 percentage points of downward pressure on loans to the non-financial private sector.[21]
Accordingly, as central bank liquidity declines, we may see tighter credit conditions in the economy. This could slow down investment and consumption, with firms cutting back on capital expenditure and consumers reducing purchases of big-ticket items that require financing.[22]
Incoming data suggest that euro area GDP growth will remain subdued in the short term. Industrial production decreased notably in December and surveys indicate that manufacturing is continuing to contract, whereas services activity is expanding at a moderate pace (Chart 10).
Given the uncertain economic environment, we are yet to see a sustained rebound in investment (Chart 11).[23]And while we continue to expect consumption to be the main driver of the recovery, rising real incomes have not yet encouraged households to increase their spending in a commensurate manner (Chart 12).[24]In the face of subdued domestic demand, our latest staff projections forecast a slower economic recovery than had been forecast in the September projections.[25]
Moreover, geopolitical risks may create further headwinds for the recovery, which we will need to monitor carefully. Forthcoming findings from the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) suggest that consumers’ concerns about geopolitical risks are negatively affecting economic sentiment – leading to more pessimistic expectations, more elevated income uncertainty and, ultimately, a lower propensity to consume.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-term target. As we gradually cut rates towards neutral territory, we need to be mindful of the fact that we now have two monetary policy tools working in opposing directions, given our ongoing quantitative tightening. This is a first in our history at the ECB.
We therefore need to ensure that we factor in the tightening of our balance sheet when calibrating our rate cuts to achieve our inflation aim. This is because the stance effects stemming from our rate cuts will be somewhat dampened by the tightening induced by the normalisation of our balance sheet.
This is an important consideration when discussing the appropriate policy rate path.
Similarly, we need to be mindful of the possible risks to the transmission of our monetary policy to the real economy in view of the prevailing uncertainty and potential risks to financial stability.
This cautious approach is crucial, especially given historical precedents where central banks faced unexpected challenges.
In late 2019, for instance, the Federal Reserve System was unexpectedly forced to temporarily reverse its balance sheet retrenchment due to liquidity challenges in financial markets.[26]In 2022 the Bank of England halted quantitative tightening and launched emergency gilt purchases to safeguard financial stability after pension funds’ liability-driven investment strategies exposed systemic risks.[27]
Recent bouts of market volatility also underscore that we should remain alert to the emergence of financial stability risks that may endanger transmission. Last August several factors converged to spark substantial market volatility.[28]The VIX, a market index that measures the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index, recorded its largest ever one-day spike (Chart 13).[29]
Faced with such episodes of volatility, the further decline in our balance sheet must remain on a gradual and predictable path to avoid financial amplification effects.[30]This is especially important in an environment where euro area banks are already tightening their credit standards, especially for firms and consumer credit, due to higher perceived risks related to the economic outlook (Chart 14).[31]
Our balance sheet policy instruments continue to be a crucial item in our toolbox. The expectation that we will use them if necessary protects the smooth transmission of our monetary policy and reduces the likelihood that we will need to use these tools in the first place.
Moreover, in an environment of heightened uncertainty, even in the context of excess liquidity, we need to remain prudent and be ready to step in should another shock emerge. We should maintain the flexibility to swiftly expand liquidity facilities if stressful conditions arise.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The ECB’s experience with balance sheet policies to date demonstrates their importance both for the monetary policy stance and for the transmission of our monetary policy to the real economy. They are a vital part of our toolkit.
While policy rates remain our primary instrument for adjusting the monetary policy stance, we should also consider the role played by quantitative tightening in influencing overall financial and financing conditions – be it through the yield curve or through the bank lending channel.
To strike the right balance, we should ensure that our rate decisions adequately compensate for the tightening induced by the reduction of our balance sheet.
Thank you."

Introductory remarks by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the MNI Webcast on Climate Change: Impact on Monetary Policy and Bank Supervision
Frankfurt am Main, 12 February 2025
Central banks and supervisors are not climate and nature policymakers.
Central banks and supervisors are climate and nature policy takers.
And we face an ever-increasing volume of climate and nature-related factors that we must take into account in order to successfully deliver on our mandate.
This is the fundamental principle that underpins all our climate and nature-related activities at the European Central Bank.
It is a principle grounded in irrefutable facts established by the scientific community and transposed to make their implications clear for the economy and financial system. At the ECB, we have translated this principle into our monetary policy and supervisory work as a strategic commitment to account for the ongoing climate and nature crises, irrespective of shifts in the macroeconomic tides and no matter what direction the political winds may blow.
This is why, both in our monetary policy and in our banking supervision, we have meticulously formulated strategies that are robust and resilient in all weathers. In the face of changing climates, be they macroeconomic, political or indeed at the level of our planetary ecosystem, we will continue to deliver on our mandate to keep prices stable and ensure Europe’s banks are safe and sound.
Climate and nature in monetary policy
Let me start with what we our doing when it comes to accounting for climate and nature in our monetary policy.
When the ECB concluded its strategy review in the summer of 2021, our new strategy explicitly acknowledged the profound implications of climate change for the economy and therefore its relevance for monetary policy. In our strategy, we also formulated a concrete action plan, and we are delivering on that plan.
First, we have made significant progress in improving our ability to take climate considerations into account in the macroeconomic analyses that inform our policy discussions.
Second, with respect to our monetary policy instruments, we started tilting our purchases of corporate bonds towards issuers with a better climate performance to avoid undue exposures to climate-related risks. While the last remaining purchases were suspended at the start of this year, if any corporate bond purchases were to be needed for monetary policy purposes in the future, the established direction of the tilt would set the minimum benchmark. With respect to the collateral we require for our lending operations, further technical work on incorporating climate change collateral considerations is still ongoing.
Our current actions aim to support a high degree of confidence in the alignment of our activities, within our mandate, with the goals set by the Paris Agreement. We have committed to regularly reviewing all our measures to assess their impact. If necessary, we will adapt them to ensure they continue to fulfil their monetary policy objectives and support the decarbonisation path to reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate neutrality objectives. Within our mandate, we will also look into addressing additional nature-related challenges.
Climate and nature in banking supervision
Let me move to the steps we have taken in banking supervision.
Our supervisory strategy was formulated after we learnt in 2019 that less than a quarter of the banks under our supervision had demonstrably reflected on how the climate and nature crises were affecting their risk management. This observation was obviously concerning, so in 2020 we published a guide setting out our supervisory expectations. These expectations outline the ECB’s understanding of the safe and prudent management of climate and nature-related risks under the prevailing prudential framework. Since then, we have consistently taken these risks into account in our supervisory work.
Considering the requirements clearly set out in the Capital Requirements Directive as implemented in national law, and the need for banks to implement a regular process for identifying all material risks, banks must ensure that practices are in place for the sound management of climate and nature-related risks. They had to achieve this by the end of last year and, in the run-up to that deadline, we also set interim deadlines for banks to remediate certain shortcomings related to the management of these risks. These deadlines were informed by what the banks themselves considered reasonable when we first started discussing climate and nature-related risk management with them.
We are still following up on the two earlier interim deadlines while we begin assessing banks’ practices in light of their final end-2024 deadline.
After the first interim deadline back in March 2023, we saw that many banks still had not implemented an adequate materiality assessment of the impact of climate and nature-related risks across their portfolios. The ECB imposed binding supervisory decisions on 28 banks, with 22 of them being told that if they did not remedy their shortcomings by a certain date, they would incur a periodic penalty payment for each day they remained in breach of our requirements. Encouragingly, almost all banks submitted an adequate materiality assessment in time, which shows that our supervisory efforts have been effective in almost all cases. For a few banks, the process to determine whether penalties have been incurred is ongoing.
For the second interim deadline of the end of 2023, we asked banks to clearly include climate and nature-related risks in their governance, strategy and risk management. As with the first interim deadline, we found weaknesses in banks’ practices that we communicated to them in the form of further feedback letters. In a small group of outliers, foundational elements for the adequate management of climate and nature-related risks are still missing. These banks received binding supervisory decisions in autumn 2024, again outlining the potential imposition of periodic penalty payments if they fail to meet the requirements in a timely manner.
To avoid any doubt, we will proceed in exactly the same way with respect to the third and final deadline that fell due at the turn of the year. We want to see evidence that banks’ risk management practices ensure the sound management of climate and nature-related risks across all areas of our supervisory expectations. For instance, this means that banks need to consider these risks in their stress-testing frameworks, including in plausible baseline and adverse scenarios that are in line with scientific evidence. Thereafter, banks will have to keep updating their practices in accordance with advances in data availability, methodologies and legislative and regulatory requirements. Banks need to ensure that their risk management practices remain commensurate with the magnitude of the climate and nature-related risks that they face. As supervisors, it is our job to make sure they do. To deliver on this, we will use – obviously always in a proportionate way – all supervisory instruments that we have at our disposal.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
While the fundamental principle – that climate and nature are relevant for both monetary policy and banking supervision and, therefore, must be taken into account in the exercise of our tasks – is independent of the actions of climate and nature policymakers, the intensity and configuration of the risks that will ultimately materialise is not. The choices that climate and nature policymakers make will determine what combination of transition and physical risks materialises in the years to come. Regrettably, the prevailing consensus among climate scientists is that the goal of limiting global heating to 2 degrees Celsius, as set out in the Paris Agreement, is not currently being met. Last October the UN Emissions Gap Report concluded that the world is on track for an average increase of 3.1 degrees.[1]And even that dramatic number will only be achieved if all governments stick with their current policies. The physical risks of climate and nature hazards are currently materialising at an ever-increasing scale and frequency.[2]These physical risks will continue increasing or transition policies will have to be implemented more abruptly to secure a timely transition which will cause an increase in transition risks.
To identify climate and nature-related risks, central banks, supervisors and the banks we supervise are reliant on good data. Reporting requirements in the EU’s sustainable finance framework will improve the availability of reliable and comparable data that are needed to identify and manage financial risks. This is essential to ensure that the broader sustainable finance framework can serve its purpose of unlocking finance for the green transition and thereby contributing to Europe’s competitiveness agenda.
It is inevitable that climate and nature-related risks will increase. Concealing them will not make them disappear. And ignoring them will not make them less threatening for monetary policy and banking supervision. This is why we are delivering on our strategic commitment to take them into account in our work.
Robust to any shifting tides or changing winds.
Faithful to our mandate.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the plenary session of the European Parliament
Strasbourg, 10 February 2025
It is a great pleasure to take part in this plenary session and discuss your draft resolution on the ECB’s Annual Report.
At the ECB, we are deeply committed to transparency and accountability, particularly in how we communicate with the public and their elected representatives in the European Parliament. In fact, in the last parliamentary term we interacted with this Parliament even more frequently than in previous terms.[1]
At the same time, we greatly value the opportunity to hear the Parliament’s views. Your resolution and debate are an important pillar of the ECB’s accountability framework and a key channel for you to share your views with us – and we listen. For instance, next week will mark ten years since the ECB started publishing the accounts of the Governing Council’s monetary policy meetings[2], a major step in enhancing our monetary policy communication and one that this Parliament had called for.
This year’s draft resolution covers key issues that are central to the ECB’s mandate and the future of the euro area, including our response to inflation, the digital euro and the ECB’s role in supporting the EU’s broader economic policies. It also reflects the dynamic challenges we face in Europe today, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on all of these issues and having a constructive dialogue with you.
But let me first start by outlining our view on the current economic situation in the euro area and our monetary policy stance. I will then address the broader economic challenges we are facing and their implications for monetary policy.
The euro area economy grew modestly in 2024. While output stagnated in the fourth quarter, it was still 0.9% higher than at the end of 2023. Surveys indicate that manufacturing continues to contract while services activity is expanding. Consumer confidence is fragile and, despite rising real incomes, households are hesitant to spend more.
Nevertheless, the conditions for a recovery remain in place. A solid job market and higher incomes should strengthen consumer confidence and allow spending to rise. More affordable credit should boost consumption and investment over time.Exports should also support the recovery as global demand rises, although this is conditional on developments in international trade policies.
Inflation stood at 2.5% in January and has recently developed broadly in line with staff projections. Core inflation has remained at 2.7% in recent months, reflecting a sideways movement in both services and goods inflation. Wage growth is moderating as expected, although it remains elevated, while profits are partially buffering the impact of wage increases on inflation.
Inflation is set to return to our 2% medium-term target in the course of this year, with risks on both the upside and the downside. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more uncertain.
In total, the ECB has lowered interest rates by 125 basis points since last June, and the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – now stands at 2.75%. At our last meeting in January, we decided to lower our key interest rates by 25 basis points, based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In particular, the disinflation process in the euro area is well on track. Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our target on a sustained basis. And while financing conditions continue to be tight, our recent interest rate cuts are gradually making borrowing less expensive.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-term target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
Let me now turn to the broader economic environment and its implications for monetary policy.
Europe has faced a series of unprecedented challenges in recent years, each with its own far-reaching impact. From the COVID-19 pandemic to surging energy prices and the geopolitical upheaval caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have navigated our way through a storm of supply shocks. As we look ahead, the frequency of these shocks is likely to remain high.
While we have weathered these crises, the past few years have also revealed missed opportunities and underinvestment in areas such as the digital transformation and the green transition – and the uncertainty surrounding trade and economic policy continues to weigh on consumption and investment.[3]As a result, and as highlighted in reports by Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi, Europe finds itself lagging behind international competitors in productivity and growth.
In a world driven by shifting global dynamics and rapid technological change, Europe must strike a delicate balance between achieving strategic autonomy and preserving its openness to the global economy. As President Ursula von der Leyen and I highlighted in a recent article, Europe’s response to these challenges must be bold and strategic. While the outlook may seem daunting, the prospects are more promising than they might appear.[4]
One of Europe’s first priorities should be to deepen the Internal Market. By removing remaining barriers within the Single Market – barriers that effectively function like tariffs – we can unlock economies of scale, encourage innovation and reduce costs for consumers and producers alike. We are already home to a wealth of ideas and innovators. Our challenge is to transform these ideas into technologies that fuel economic growth. To do so, we need to reduce administrative burdens and foster an innovation-friendly environment.
Another critical area is enhancing Europe’s autonomy in payments, which form the backbone of our economy and our single currency. At present, a few foreign providers dominate Europe’s payments landscape, leaving us vulnerable to external pressures. As we face an increasingly digital future, we must prepare the ground for a digital euro. This will ensure the resilience and public good nature of our payment systems. It will also provide a platform for private innovation in digital payments.
With substantial savings at its disposal, Europe must channel more resources into private investment and scale up financing to support its innovators. A genuine capital markets union designed for citizens and businesses alike will be instrumental here.
More broadly, investment must be the cornerstone of Europe’s economic transformation. The focus must be on investing in physical and digital infrastructure, research and development, and green technologies. These are not optional but essential investments required to drive productivity and guarantee Europe’s competitiveness on the global stage. Moreover, they will address our energy dependence and help us meet our climate goals – both pressing imperatives.
In this regard, we welcome the European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass as a concrete roadmap for action, which will also support the ECB in maintaining price stability by reducing Europe’s susceptibility to supply shocks.
That said, the ECB is not standing idle. We are committed to learning from the experiences of recent years. As part of the ongoing assessment of our monetary policy strategy, we are preparing for the risk of an increasingly volatile future. We are taking stock of a changed inflation environment and economic context. We are also focusing on the implications for monetary policy, our experiences with our evolving policy toolkit, our reaction function and how to better deal with risk and uncertainty in policy setting and communications. While the ECB continuously evaluates and adapts its economic models – a topic raised in your resolution – assessing new analytical needs will be one component of this assessment.
Let me conclude.
The challenges facing Europe are immense, but solutions are within our reach. Our opportunity lies in more Europe.
As Konrad Adenauer said 70 years ago, “European unity was the dream of a few. It became the hope for many. Today it is a necessity for all of us.” This sentiment rings true today more than ever.
To jointly tackle Europe’s challenges, I am counting on the Parliament’s commitment. Within its mandate, the ECB will play its part. Ever since the introduction of the euro, the ECB has continuously adapted to changing economic environments to fulfil its mandate. We remain fully committed to delivering on this mandate. We are equally committed to maintaining our active and meaningful dialogue with the Parliament.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE)
Washington, D.C., 5 February 2025
It is a pleasure to be here at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE): your impressive research on a wide range of topics is extremely valuable for policymakers.[1]
At last week’s monetary policy meeting, the ECB’s Governing Council decided to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – by 25 basis points from 3.0 per cent to 2.75 per cent. In cumulative terms, the deposit facility rate has declined by 125 basis points since last June. The decision reflected our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
In what follows, I will explain in more detail the basis for this decision. I will review inflation developments, economic developments, our risk assessment, and financial and monetary conditions. Finally, I explain why pursuing a middle path for monetary policy is best suited to the current environment.
Inflation developments
The disinflation process remains well on track. Inflation has continued to develop broadly in line with the staff projections and is set to return to our two per cent medium-term target in the course of this year. Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our target on a sustained basis. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which has the best predictive power among underlying inflation indicators for future headline inflation, continued to hover around two per cent in the December data, indicating that headline inflation is set to stabilise around our target.
Domestic inflation, at 4.2 per cent, stayed well above all the other indicators in December mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. However, the PCCI for services, which should act as an underlying attractor for services inflation and domestic inflation, fell to 2.3 per cent.
The anticipation of a downward shift in services inflation in the coming months also relates to the expected deceleration in wage growth in the course of 2025. Wages have been adjusting to the past inflation surges with a substantial delay, but the ECB wage tracker and the latest surveys point to a significant moderation in wage pressures this year. According to the latest results of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), firms expect wages to grow by 3.3 per cent on average over the next twelve months, down from 4.5 per cent this time last year. Similarly, the latest Corporate Telephone Survey indicates that wage growth should decelerate from 4.3 per cent in 2024 to 3.6 per cent in 2025 and 2.7 per cent in 2026. This assessment is shared broadly among forecasters. Consensus Economics, for example, foresees a decline in wage growth by about one percentage point between 2024 and 2025.
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around two per cent, despite an uptick at shorter horizons that may reflect the recent rise in energy prices. While the inflation expectations of firms have stabilised at three per cent across horizons, according to the SAFE, larger firms that are aware of the ECB’s inflation target show convergence towards two per cent. Consumer inflation expectations have edged up recently, especially for the near term, which can at least be partly explained by their higher sensitivity to the recent uptick in realised inflation. Inflation expectations of professionals – as captured by the latest vintages of the Survey of Professional Forecasters and Survey of Monetary Analysts – as well as market-based measures of inflation compensation have ticked up for the near term but, over longer horizons, remain stable at levels consistent with our medium-term target of two per cent.
Economic developments
On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, the 2024 growth rate came in at 0.9 per cent, constituting a material improvement in momentum relative to the 2023 growth rate of 0.1 per cent. While 2024 saw a modest recovery in consumption, investment remained weak and exporters continued to suffer competitiveness challenges. In terms of the quarterly profile, growth stagnated in the final quarter following a comparatively robust third quarter.
The incoming survey indicators suggest that the euro area economy is set to remain subdued in the near term. While unemployment remained low at 6.3 per cent in December, there has been some softening in labour demand, as reflected in lower vacancies and lower employment growth.
At the same time, our baseline assessment is that the conditions for a recovery remain in place. Higher incomes, lower interest rates and stronger household balance sheets should allow a faster pick-up in consumption. More affordable credit should also boost housing and business investment over time. Exports should also support the recovery as global demand rises, although this is highly conditional on developments in international trade policies.
Financial and monetary conditions
Global and euro area bond yields have increased significantly since our last meeting. Amongst other factors, the spillover impact of the rise in US and global longer-term rates has contributed to the steepening of the euro area yield curve.
Our past interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow. The cost of borrowing for firms has declined by 92 basis points and mortgage rates have declined by 62 basis points since their peaks in autumn 2023. However, the interest rates on existing corporate and household loan books remain high, especially in real terms, with pre-2022 debt still re-pricing at higher rates as fixation periods expire.
In overall terms, financing conditions remain tight. While credit is expanding, lending to firms and households remains subdued relative to historical norms. Growth in bank lending to firms rose to 1.5 per cent in December. In part, the pick-up in December reflects firms substituting market-based long-term financing for bank-based borrowing amidst tightening market conditions and increasing upcoming redemptions of long-term corporate bonds. Overall external debt financing of firms increased by 1.9 per cent in December, but remained well below the historical average of 4.9 per cent.[2]Loans to households continued to rise gradually, driven by mortgages, but remained muted overall, with an annual growth rate of 1.1 per cent in December, notably below the long-term average of 4.2 per cent.
According to the latest bank lending survey, the demand for loans by firms increased slightly in the fourth quarter. At the same time, credit standards for loans to firms have tightened again, after having broadly stabilised over the previous four quarters. The renewed tightening of credit standards for firms was driven by the fact that banks see higher risks to the economic outlook and have lower tolerance for taking on credit risk. This finding is consistent with the results from the SAFE, in which firms reported a small decline in the availability of bank loans and more demanding non-rate lending conditions. In terms of households, the demand for mortgages increased strongly, mostly on the back of more attractive interest rates and better prospects for the property market. Credit standards for housing loans remained unchanged overall.
Risk assessment
Risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. In addition to trade policy uncertainty, lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and further weigh on global trade. Growth could also be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. In the other direction, growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster.
We take a two-sided approach to assessing inflation risk. Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more uncertain.
A middle path for monetary policy
Taken together, the incoming data since our previous meeting meant that it was clear that we should take a further step in monetary easing by lowering the deposit facility rate to 2.75 per cent. By excessively dampening demand, the alternative of holding the deposit facility rate at the level of 3.0 per cent would not have been consistent with the set of rate paths that would best ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. At the same time, the new level for the deposit facility rate at 2.75 per cent preserves considerable optionality in responding to shocks. In particular, the rate path can adjust as appropriate in the event of material upside or downside shocks to the inflation outlook and/or to economic momentum.
While our baseline is that inflation should decline from 2.5 per cent in January to around our target in the coming months, it is still important to take into account that this deceleration might take longer than expected and that new upside risks to inflation could emerge, including due to external developments. These considerations explain why we have taken a step-by-step approach to rate cutting since last June.
At the same time, an excessive abundance of caution in monetary easing could threaten the recovery in domestic demand that is needed to support the pricing environment compatible with our medium-term two per cent target. Under this too-cautious path, a below-target inflation dynamic could take hold, which would then require a more sizeable policy response to ensure inflation returns to our symmetric two per cent medium-term target.
Balancing these considerations suggest a middle path is appropriate, which neither over-weighs upside risk nor over-weighs downside risk. That is, a robust monetary policy approach should balance the risks of moving too slowly against the risks of moving too quickly. Accordingly, it is prudent to maintain agility in adjusting the stance as appropriate on a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting basis and to not pre-commit to any particular rate path.
In closing, let me comment on two much-discussed concepts: restrictiveness and neutrality.
When inflation is materially above target and requires a monetary response to ensure that it returns to target in a timely manner and that inflation expectations remain anchored, the monetary stance must be clearly restrictive. As inflation returns close to target, policymakers need to shift their focus to adjusting monetary policy in line with the incoming economic and financial data and the evolving risk assessment to deliver the two per cent target over the medium term. In other words, policymakers should deliver the monetary stance that is appropriate to the situation.
In exiting a restrictive phase, much energy could be diverted towards creating a summary “restrictiveness” index. Any such index would have to incorporate at least nine factors: (i) the still-important rolling off of super-cheap debt that was taken out in the “low for long” era that is now being re-financed at higher rates; (ii) in the other direction, the transmission of the easing since the peak of the hiking cycle; (iii) the impact of the anticipation of future rate cuts on current financing conditions; (iv) the evolving contribution of quasi-exogenous influences on financing conditions (such as global upward pressure on term premia); (v) the dynamics of bond and equity risk premia; (vi) the evolution of credit standards in bank lending; (vii) the different timelines for market-based and bank-based transmission; (viii) the responsiveness of consumption and investment to shifting monetary conditions; and (ix) the responsiveness of price setting to shifting monetary conditions.
All of these factors enter our calibration of monetary policy (our assessment of the strength of monetary policy transmission has been highlighted as central to our reaction function) and cannot be summarised by a single indicator such as comparing the prevailing policy rate to a highly-uncertain estimate of the so-called neutral rate.[3]
In terms of policy making, uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate and, more generally, about the strength of monetary transmission inescapably sits alongside uncertainty about the inflation outlook and uncertainty about the economic outlook.
This is why our 2021 monetary policy strategy statement highlights that our decisions are based on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. Over the last two years, we have emphasised in particular the importance of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission as particularly relevant in complementing our analysis of the inflation outlook.  More generally, it is essential that all relevant risks are incorporated in monetary policy decisions."

Lamfalussy Lecture by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Lamfalussy Lectures Conference organised by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank, pre-recorded in Frankfurt am Main on 15 January 2025
Budapest, 27 January 2025
In his later years, Alexandre Lamfalussy was once asked what his fundamental motivation in life was. He recalled the experience of his turbulent youth, surrounded by the destruction caused by the Second World War.[1]“In the aftermath of the war,” Lamfalussy said, “I decided to serve the community in the rebuilding of Europe.”[2]
He went on to do just that. A member of the Delors Committee and the first President of the European Monetary Institute, Lamfalussy helped pave the way for Europe’s monetary union and the establishment of the ECB.
His generation had also been scarred by the difficulties of the “Great Inflation” in the 1970s.[3]And so Lamfalussy – alongside other architects of the euro[4]– ensured that the ECB would have sufficient powers to prevent a scenario where inflationary expectations once again became embedded in the economy.
We can see proof of this today, as advanced economies emerge from the largest inflation shock in a generation.
As in the 1970s, a series of shocks contributed to high and persistent inflation. But unlike the 1970s, inflation has since fallen relatively fast across advanced economies – and expectations have remained firmly anchored throughout.
This hard-won progress has been in large part due to the independence of central banks, which has given them the ability to take difficult but necessary monetary policy decisions in pursuit of stable prices.
The rise of central bank independence
In the late twentieth century, central bank independence spread rapidly around the world.
A strong social consensus about its benefits – emerging from the negative experience of the 1970s – sparked what Lamfalussy would later call a “sea change” in monetary policymaking.[5]
By one account, over 80% of the world’s central banks became operationally independent by the turn of the millennium.[6]And price stability had been adopted as the primary objective of monetary policy frameworks across almost all advanced economies and many emerging market economies.[7]
Moreover, independent central banks both contributed to – and benefited from – a period of low macroeconomic volatility.
In their famous paper, Alesina and Summers found a positive relationship between the degree of independence of central banks and lower and less volatile inflation outcomes.[8]At the same time, substantial structural changes were afoot in the global economy, which also helped to reduce macroeconomic volatility – an era that soon came to be known as the Great Moderation.[9]
Globalisation led to an enormous increase in both global labour supply and production capacity, which meant that prices and wages were often little affected even in the face of strong demand. And the oil crises of the 1970s had sparked a wave of change in global energy markets, resulting in a more elastic energy supply.
The upshot of the Great Moderationwas avirtuous circle.
An environment of low macroeconomic volatility made it easier for independent central banks to deliver on their price stability mandates. That, in turn, solidified the social consensus in support of central bank independence and helped ensure its growing adoption around the world – further contributing to lowering levels of volatility.
The era of volatility
The end of the Great Moderation came suddenly and unexpectedly in 2008 with the arrival of the global financial crisis. And over the last years in particular, our world has changed dramatically.
Indeed, the two forces that fostered the spread of central bank independence – a strong social consensus and growing pools of global supply – are now coming under increasing pressure.
While recent research suggests thatde jurecentral bank independence has never been more prevalent than it is today[10], there is no doubt that thede factoindependence of central banks is being called into question in several parts of the world.
One study examining 118 central banks in the 2010s shows that around 10% of them faced political pressure in an average year – even those central banks with a high degree ofde jureindependence.[11]Another paper finds that between 2018 and 2020 alone,de factocentral bank independence deteriorated for almost half of those central banks in jurisdictions accounting for 75% of global GDP.[12]
There is evidence to suggest that political influence on central bank decisions can also contribute substantially to macroeconomic volatility. For instance, persistent political pressure on a central bank has been found to affect the level and the volatility of exchange rates, bond yields and the risk premium.[13]
At the same time, geopolitical tensions threaten to amplify volatility by increasing the frequency of shocks hitting the global economy.
We have already seen the impact of geopolitical tensions play out in Europe. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, average output growth volatility in the euro area surged by 60% compared with before the global financial crisis, while average inflation volatility shot up by 280%.[14]
An environment of heightened volatility could make the task of maintaining price stability more difficult to achieve.[15]This could raise concerns that independent central banks are failing to deliver on their mandates, which could undermine the social consensus and further amplify volatility in the economy.
So, the question that comes to the fore is: will the current era of volatility turn the virtuous circle that facilitated the rise of central bank independence into a vicious circle that leads to it being undermined?
The benefits of central bank independence in today’s world
All things considered, I would argue that this is unlikely to happen.
A volatile macroeconomic environment actually makes the benefits of central bank independence all the greater. We saw this during the recent inflation shock.
In OECD countries, average annual inflation surged to 9.6% in 2022 as they faced a variety of shocks that compounded each other.[16]In response, independent central banks sharply increased policy rates.
These actions led to a rapid decline and convergence in the respective inflation paths of major economies – despite all these economies facing different shocks. Moreover, inflation expectations have remained firmly anchored, suggesting that the public continues to have faith in independent central banks’ commitment to price stability over the long run.[17]
In today’s world, central bank independence offers two key advantages.
First, it acts as a headwind to volatility in these unpredictable times.
As we emerge from a period of very high inflation, the issue of time inconsistency is more relevant than ever.[18]Compared with the pre-pandemic era of low inflation, central banks may need to contend with lower levels of rational inattention.[19]
In this environment, credible policy regimes become even more important for maintaining trust in central banks. Research finds that higher trust in the ECB lowers inflation expectations on average and significantly reduces uncertainty about future inflation.[20]
Second, central bank independence also contributes to regional strength in a world increasingly defined by geopolitical rivalries.
Price stability provides the foundation upon which other strategic goals can be achieved. Regions with stable prices tend to have more efficient resource allocation and higher levels of competitiveness, and they attract greater levels of investment. At heart, strong economic institutions are the fundamental cause of long-run economic growth and development differences between regions.[21]
Conclusion
Lamfalussy once described the task of launching the euro as “navigating in uncharted waters”.[22]In an era of volatility, independent central banks now also find themselves in unfamiliar waters.
While inflation has fallen sharply, central banks are still likely to face a more volatile macroeconomic environment compared with the Great Moderation.
It therefore remains imperative that central banks have the independence to fully deliver on their price stability mandates.
Thank you."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 15th edition of Spain Investors Day
Madrid, 15 January 2025
It is a pleasure to speak here again this year.[1]In my remarks last year, I expanded on monetary policy in the face of high inflation risks. The outlook was then still being shaped by the easing of pandemic-related supply constraints and by the energy price shock. Inflation had fallen rapidly from its peak in autumn 2022, but we needed to keep monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely and sustainable return of inflation to our 2% target.
Today, the euro area is in a very different place. Having cut interest rates four times since last June, by a total of 100 basis points, we have made substantial progress in bringing inflation back to target. At the same time, the balance of macroeconomic risks has shifted from concerns about high inflation to concerns about low growth. The outlook is clouded by even higher uncertainty, driven by potential global trade frictions, macroeconomic fragmentation, geopolitical tensions and fiscal policy concerns in the euro area. As the new year starts, it is imperative to work towards resolving the various conflicts happening in the world.
Today I will outline how the Governing Council is taking this uncertainty into account in its assessment of the inflation and growth outlook, and how a sound financial system is vital in supporting monetary policy. I will then explain the rationale behind the monetary policy decisions that we took in December and how we will approach policy decisions over the coming months.
Inflation
The good news is that the disinflation process is well on track. Headline inflation came down quickly in 2023 from the double-digit figures we saw at the end of 2022, as the impact of energy and supply-side shocks faded. The decline in 2024 was more gradual but clearly in the right direction, with inflation averaging 2.4% over the year. The slight increase in inflation in December owing to energy-related base effects had been expected. Core inflation also declined over the past two years, falling from 5% in 2023 to 2.8% in 2024.
Most measures of underlying inflation continue to suggest that inflation will settle near our 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. One of these measures, our Persistent and Common Component of Inflation, for example, which has the best predictive power for headline inflation over the one to two-year ahead horizon, has been around 2% for more than a year. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, has edged down, but it remains high (at more than 4%) mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation with a delay. Wage growth has also been moderating.
The December Eurosystem staff projections expect inflation to average 2.1% in 2025 and to return sustainably to our target rather early in the projection horizon.
Economic activity
The outlook for the euro area economy, however, remains weak and subject to significant uncertainty. Output grew above expectations in the third quarter of 2024. This was mainly driven by an increase in consumption, which partly reflect one-off factors that boosted tourism over the summer, and by firms building up inventories. The latest information suggests that the economy is losing momentum. Surveys indicate that manufacturing is still contracting and growth in services is slowing, as still-high energy prices, regulatory costs and the lagged effects of previous monetary policy tightening continue to bite. Firms are holding back on investments, and exports remain weak, with some European industries struggling to remain competitive. The labour market remains resilient, with employment growing in the third quarter of 2024, again by more than expected, and the unemployment rate remaining at its historical low of 6.3% in October. Overall, the December projections see growth in 2024 at 0.7%.
Looking ahead, the conditions are in place for growth to strengthen over the projection horizon, although less than was forecast in previous rounds. As the catching up of wages continues and as inflation falls, rising real wages should lead to stronger household spending. More affordable credit should boost consumption and investment. Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should also support the recovery as global demand rises. Growth is projected to be just above 1% in 2025 and to move slightly up to modest levels in 2026 and 2027.
Nevertheless, the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. In particular, the outlook is characterised by high uncertainty around future trade policies in the United States, political and fiscal policy uncertainty in some large euro area countries as well as global geopolitical risks. In fact, over the past year the European Commission’s uncertainty index has reached its highest level to date. Furthermore, with formal budget submissions from several euro area countries still pending, projecting the future fiscal policy stance is challenging.
This environment of very high uncertainty could dent confidence and dampen the recovery in consumption and investment. Such pessimismis visible, for instance, in consumer expectations. While real household income increased both in 2023 and 2024 according to national accounts, only little more than a third of respondents to our latest Consumer Expectations Survey see their real income as having increased or at least stayed the same. Whereas only about 10% of households indicate an increase in perceived real income, in reality more than half of the households surveyed experienced an increase in their real income, when inflation is netted out from their self-reported nominal income.[2]
Financial stability
In this volatile economic environment, we see elevated financial stability vulnerabilities.
High valuations and concentrated risks leave financial markets vulnerable to adverse dynamics, which could be exacerbated by non-banks. Non-bank financial intermediaries have remained resilient to recent bouts of market volatility, supporting market-based finance in the euro area. However, broader market shocks could trigger sudden investment fund outflows or margin calls on derivative exposures. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales amplifying the fall in asset prices. While generally limited, pockets of elevated financial and synthetic leverage in some entities, like hedge funds, may add to spillover risks.
Simultaneously, sovereign vulnerabilities are increasing. Despite recent reductions in debt-to-GDP ratios in some euro area countries, fiscal challenges persist in several others. They are exacerbated by heightened policy and geopolitical uncertainty and structural issues such as sluggish potential growth. We therefore need to keep monitoring risks to financial stability carefully, including those stemming from recent increases in sovereign yields in the United States, the United Kingdom and, though more moderate, in the euro area.
On a more positive note, euro area banks are strong. Their resilience has been underpinned by solid capital ratios, robust liquidity buffers and high bank profitability. The latter may have reached its peak, however, as net interest margins are already declining while credit losses are gradually rising.
In this uncertain macro-financial environment, preserving bank resilience remains crucial. Existing releasable macroprudential capital buffer requirements and adequate borrower-based measures should be maintained to ensure that banks can absorb any future shocks. At the same time, the policy framework for non-banks should be improved from a macroprudential perspective to strengthen the sector’s resilience. Finally, to mitigate the current risks to sovereign debt sustainability, it is important to implement the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully, transparently and without delay. Given the structural challenges related to low potential growth, the consolidation of public finances will need to be designed in a growth-friendly way.[3]
Conclusion
Let me conclude. In December we decided to further moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction, lowering the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are also continuing the process of balance sheet normalisation. In December the last repayment of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations was completed and reinvestments were discontinued.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-term target. Given the high level of uncertainty, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. The high level of uncertainty calls for prudence. In particular, severe global trade frictions could increase the fragmentation of the world economy, uncertainty about fiscal policy and its present challenges could weigh on borrowing costs, and renewed geopolitical tensions could affect energy prices. We are therefore not pre-committing to a particular rate path. If the incoming data confirm our baseline, the policy trajectory is clear, and we expect to continue to further reduce the restrictiveness of monetary policy."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, MNI Webcast
Frankfurt am Main, 18 December 2024
Introduction
The Governing Council last week decided to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – from 3.25 per cent to 3.0 per cent. This decision was justified by our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In my remarks, I would like to discuss these three elements of our reaction function.[1][2]
The inflation outlook
The December Eurosystem staff projections expect headline inflation to average 2.4 per cent in 2024, 2.1 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026. It is then projected to increase to 2.1 per cent in 2027 as a result of the expanded EU Emissions Trading System. The projections continue to foresee a rapid decline in core inflation, from 2.9 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 2027. Compared to the September 2024 macroeconomic projections exercise (MPE), the projections have been revised down by 0.1 percentage points in 2024 and 2025 for headline inflation, and in 2026 for core inflation.
The latest Survey of Monetary Analysts is broadly in line with the December projections for headline inflation. Market-based indicators of inflation compensation are also consistent with a timely return of inflation to target, while also showing a marked compression in inflation risk premia. This may suggest that markets have revised downwards the risk of future adverse supply shocks and revised upwards the risk of future adverse demand shocks.
The economic outlook plays a central role in determining the inflation outlook. The incoming information suggests a slowdown in the near term. Looking ahead, conditions are in place for growth to strengthen over the forecast horizon. According to the staff assessment, while structural factors have weighed on the euro area economy, especially the manufacturing sector, the weak productivity growth since 2022 has also included a significant cyclical component, largely driven by the past tightening of monetary policy and weak external demand. Domestic demand should therefore benefit from rising real wages, the gradual fading of the effects of restrictive monetary policy and the ongoing recovery in the global economy. Although fiscal policies are set to remain on a consolidation path overall, funds from the Next Generation EU programme will still support investment in the next two years.
On the external side, euro area export growth is expected to benefit from strengthening foreign demand. At the same time, trade uncertainty has increased materially and the effects of a potential increase in tariffs on the euro area economy will depend on the extent, timing and magnitude of tariff and non-tariff measures, as well as on the responses of the EU and other countries.
The labour market remains resilient. Employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, again surprising to the upside, and the unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.3 per cent in October. However, labour demand continues to soften. The job vacancy rate declined to 2.5 per cent in the third quarter, 0.8 percentage points below its peak, and surveys also point to fewer jobs being created in the current quarter.
According to the December Eurosystem staff projections, real GDP growth is expected to average 0.7 per cent in 2024, 1.1 per cent in 2025, 1.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.3 per cent in 2027. Compared to the September projections, real GDP growth has been revised down by 0.1 percentage points in 2024 and 2025. The latest Survey of Monetary Analysts indicates a lower growth profile than the staff projections for 2025, 2026 and 2027.
The inflation outlook also encompasses the assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline path. The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Growth could also be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. It could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster, which would also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks.
Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly could drive up food prices by more than expected. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more uncertain.
Underlying inflation
The indicators of underlying inflation with the highest predictive power are developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to target; in particular, the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) measure remains at around 2.0 per cent. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, again eased somewhat in October. But at 4.2 per cent, it remained high, reflecting strong wage pressures and the fact that some services prices have still been adjusting to the past inflation surge.
At the same time, the incoming information points to a moderation in services inflation dynamics, which should support an easing of domestic inflation. The three-month-on-three-month seasonally adjusted services inflation rate fell to 2.6 per cent in November from 3.4 per cent in October, indicating a further softening in momentum. Meanwhile, the sizeable gap between services inflation and its medium-term underlying trend – captured by the PCCI for services, which stands at 2.5 per cent – suggests there should be further downward adjustment in services inflation in the coming months.
The incoming wage data broadly confirm our previous assessment of elevated but easing wage pressures. The growth rate of compensation per employee moderated to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7 per cent in the second quarter, 0.1 percentage points below the December projection. The growth rate of unit labour costs eased to 4.3 per cent from 5.2 per cent. Profit margins continue to buffer the impact of elevated labour costs on inflation: annual growth in unit profits remained negative in the third quarter. Forward-looking wage trackers continue to point to a material easing of wage growth in 2025.
The strength of monetary policy transmission
Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the perceived worsening of the economic outlook and the consequent repricing of policy rate expectations. Our past interest rate cuts – together with the anticipation of future cuts – are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow. The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a percentage point below its peak a year earlier. The cost of issuing market-based debt has fallen by more than a percentage point since its peak. The average rate on new mortgages has also come down, to 3.6 per cent in October, around half a percentage point below its peak in 2023.
But financing conditions remain restrictive. The cost of new credit for firms is elevated in historical comparison, particularly in real terms, and the cumulative tightening of credit standards since the beginning of the hiking cycle remains elevated. The average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is set to rise as loans granted at fixed rates reprice at higher levels. Bank lending to firms has only gradually picked up, from subdued levels, with the annual rate of increase rising to 1.2 per cent in October. The annual growth rate of debt securities issued by firms stood at 3.1 per cent in October, remaining within the narrow range observed over recent months. Mortgage lending continued to drift up gradually, to an annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent in October.
Conclusion
In summary, the incoming information and the latest staff projections indicate that the disinflation process remains well on track. While domestic inflation is still high, it should come down as services inflation dynamics moderate and labour cost pressures ease. Recent policy rate cuts are also gradually transmitting to funding costs, but financing conditions along the entire transmission chain, starting with the level of our policy rate and including the market interest rates that financial intermediaries charge on credit to households and firms, remain restrictive.
This assessment explains the decision to lower the deposit facility rate by 25 basis points. Looking to the future, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty, it is prudent to maintain agility on a meeting-by-meeting basis and not pre-commit to any particular rate path. In terms of risk management, monetary easing can proceed more slowly compared to the interest rate path embedded in the December projections in the event of upside shocks to the inflation outlook and/or to economic momentum. Equally, in the event of downside shocks to the inflation outlook and/or to economic momentum, monetary easing can proceed more quickly. All else equal, the rate path will also be influenced by our ongoing assessment of underlying inflation dynamics and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path."

Keynote speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the CEPR Paris Symposium 2024 hosted by the Banque de France
Paris, 16 December 2024
Monetary policy is at a critical juncture.
Growing confidence in a sustainable decline of inflation towards our 2% target has allowed the Governing Council to remove substantial policy restriction over the past six months. With our decision last week to cut the three key policy rates by a further 25 basis points, the deposit facility rate is now at 3%, one percentage point below its peak.
Today I will argue that, with interest rates approaching neutral territory and with risks to the inflation outlook broadly balanced, monetary policy should proceed gradually and remain data-dependent.
In this way, we can ensure that disinflation does not stall above our 2% target, while avoiding unnecessary weakness in the labour market and the economy at large.
I will also argue that, once price stability has been restored, the challenges for monetary policy will change. As inflation becomes dominated by idiosyncratic shocks again, central banks can afford to be more tolerant of moderate deviations from target – in both directions.
Staff projections confirm nearing return to price stability
Incoming data and the new Eurosystem staff projections have confirmed that the disinflation process remains well on track.
Inflation is now expected to decline towards our 2% target in the course of 2025 and to oscillate around this level over the projection horizon, as domestic price pressures ease and base effects from energy prices fade (Slide 2, left-hand side).
Growth has been revised down but is still expected to accelerate next year, as consumption and investment recover on the back of rising real incomes and less restrictive financing conditions (Slide 2, right-hand side).
As ECB staff continue to project that the euro area economy will expand at a pace around its potential growth rate in the coming years, inflation should neither over- nor undershoot our 2% target materially over the projection horizon once past shocks have fully unwound.
Three factors support the assumptions underlying this projected recovery.
One is the upside surprise to growth in the third quarter, with private consumption picking up and inventories no longer weighing on growth (Slide 3, left-hand side). A turnaround in the inventory cycle would remove a significant drag on aggregate demand.
Second, confidence in the retail trade sector as well as consumer expectations for major purchases over the next twelve months continued to improve in November, while savings intentions declined somewhat (Slide 3, right-hand side).
Third, according to model-based analyses, over the next twelve months an economic expansion is still much more probable than a recession, despite the prospect of more trade barriers clouding the euro area economic outlook (Slide 4, left-hand side).
Although the baseline forecast does not incorporate the potential impact of concrete policy measures of the new Trump administration, as these remain uncertain, recent sentiment indicators are likely to partially reflect the surge in trade policy uncertainty already (Slide 4, right-hand side).
Empirical research suggests that, rather than the actual tariff increase itself, it is the rise in uncertainty that will be the main drag on growth. But these effects are often estimated to be short-lived, with growth rebounding sharply once uncertainty fades.[1]
Gradual removal of policy restriction remains appropriate
The staff projections are therefore consistent with bringing interest rates to a neutral setting as inflation stabilises sustainably around our 2% target.
The question then is how fast we should remove policy restriction.
Our decision last week to cut our key policy rates by 25 basis points reflects the conviction that a gradual and data-dependent approach remains the most appropriate strategy.[2]
There are three reasons for this.
First, while we are increasingly confident that price stability is within reach, an important part of disinflation has yet to materialise.
Services inflation, in particular, remains high at 3.9%. At the same time, momentum indicators, such as the three-month-on-three-month rate, suggest that price pressures have started to ease. But such signals critically depend on the way the seasonal adjustment is done.
For example, shifts in households’ consumption patterns in the wake of the pandemic may be making the seasonal adjustment more difficult. Estimates by financial market participants suggest that, when correcting for these potential shifts, momentum could be measurably higher than what our current estimates imply.[3]
Indeed, over the past two years, November has turned out to be a notable outlier in terms of the month-on-month change in services inflation (Slide 5, left-hand side).
Also, while the baseline scenario assumes a cyclical recovery in productivity growth that is expected to ease the growth in unit labour costs, hysteresis effects or other structural factors could weigh on productivity and investment over an extended period of time.
Recent scenario analysis conducted by ECB staff shows that, in that case, growth would be lower and inflation higher – 0.3 percentage points cumulatively by 2026 – than in the baseline (Slide 5, right-hand side).[4]These effects would rise notably if the forces weighing on productivity growth were more permanent.
So, even if most of the evidence points to continued disinflation, we should remain alert to signs that cast doubt on our baseline. A gradual approach allows us to react to such signs.
Second, new shocks keep hitting the euro area economy, many of them posing upside risks to inflation.
Gas prices, for example, have doubled since February (Slide 6, left-hand side). As a result, wholesale electricity prices have increased substantially. Food prices, too, have started rising at a concerning pace, at an annualised three-month-on-three-month rate of 4.6% in November, up from 0.9% in May (Slide 6, right-hand side).
Moreover, climate mitigation measures are increasingly affecting prices over the medium term.
In 2027, for example, Eurosystem staff expect inflation to rise above 2%, mainly due to the planned expansion of the EU emissions trading system to buildings, road transport and small industry (ETS2).[5]
In addition, while the direction and persistence of the various effects of potential tariffs on inflation are ambiguous, their net effect is often estimated to be positive.
While a decline in foreign demand for euro area goods as well as trade diversion, especially from China, are likely to be disinflationary, several channels could mitigate or even offset these forces.
For example, the EU may retaliate with tariffs of its own, as it did in 2018. Also, the parallel impulse to the US economy coming from expansionary fiscal and supply-side policies could support foreign demand, even as tariffs increase, because many products are not substitutable in the short run.
Finally, since the end of September the euro has depreciated by more than 6% against the US dollar, largely in anticipation of the incoming US administration’s economic policy intentions. This is already putting upward pressure on import prices.
Such inflationary shocks are of particular concern in the current environment, as people are paying more attention to inflation after recent experiences. The latest Eurobarometer reveals that inflation remains people’s biggest concern in most euro area countries.[6]This attention makes inflation expectations more vulnerable after a long period of high inflation.
Proceeding gradually allows us to respond to new shocks in an environment of elevated uncertainty and volatility.
Third, a gradual approach is the most appropriate course of action the closer we are getting to neutral territory.
There are two related sets of benchmarks for monetary policy.
One is simple Taylor-type policy rules that are used in most structural models to replicate the systematic response of monetary policy to movements in inflation and growth. While such rules need to be treated with caution, they are a useful policy benchmark.
As there are many ways such rules can be formulated and estimated, it is helpful to use a thick-modelling framework that reduces some of the data and model uncertainty.
Such a framework currently suggests that the median rule points to a gradual dialling back of policy restriction (Slide 7). It also suggests that the distribution of projected interest rate outcomes is skewed to the upside.
The second benchmark is the natural real rate of interest, r*. There is no consensus on what its main drivers are, or on how to best estimate it. As a result, the range of estimates is exceptionally large, both within and across models.
Recent analysis by ECB staff across a suite of models suggest that the point estimate of r* ranges from about -0.5% to 1%, or about 1.5% to 3% in nominal terms.[7]This is similar to recent estimates by economists from the Bank for International Settlements.[8]
Significant parameter uncertainty makes it even more challenging to use the natural rate as a guidepost for monetary policy.
In this uncertain environment, it is helpful to focus on what has changed in recent years to understand whether real equilibrium rates could be higher today than during the 2010s. An increase would warrant a more cautious approach by central banks removing policy restriction.
Changes in the demand for and supply of global savings suggest that equilibrium rates may have increased in recent years.
The pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other shocks have led to an increase in public debt around the world (Slide 8, left-hand side). Net borrowing by governments remains substantial. In 2024, the public deficit will be around 5% of GDP across advanced economies and it is expected to decline only marginally in the coming years, also reflecting borrowing requirements associated with the digital and green transitions (Slide 8, right-hand side).
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that, in the coming years, overall global investment – public and private – will reach the highest share in GDP since the 1980s.
It is likely that, as a result, real interest rates need to rise to clear the global market for savings. This may especially be the case as rising geopolitical fragmentation contributes to reducing the supply of savings, including those provided by price-insensitive investors.
In the United States, for example, the decline in the share of foreign official holdings of US Treasury securities has accelerated in recent years (Slide 9, left-hand side). It is now at the lowest level in more than twenty years.[9]
Incidentally, since about late 2022, asset swap spreads started to widen measurably in both the euro area and the United States, suggesting that investors are gradually demanding a higher return to warehouse the supply of global public bonds (Slide 9, right-hand side).[10]
These developments are contributing to the reversal of the global savings glut, which put notable downward pressure on real rates for the greater part of the 21st century.[11]
This has repercussions for the assessment of the monetary policy stance.
For example, given the notable increase in real short-term rates expected to prevail in the distant future, which are often taken as proxies for the natural rate, the policy stance today may already be in neutral territory, as real spot rates have started to fall below their equilibrium levels (Slide 10).
Other indicators point in a similar direction.
In our most recent bank lending survey, for example, 93% of banks report that the general level of interest rates no longer plays a role in explaining weak loan demand. This contrasts sharply with a year ago when almost half of the banks said that interest rates were a factor contributing to lower loan demand.
Similarly, the survey on the access to finance of enterprises shows that the pressure from interest expenses is gradually easing. The net percentage of firms indicating an increase in interest expenses fell from 36% to 19%, reaching similar levels to those recorded at the end of 2021.
Finally, among households, we have observed a notable turnaround in the demand for housing loans. A net 39% of banks reported higher demand in the third quarter, a share close to the historical peak of 45% and well above the historical average (Slide 11, left-hand side).
This increase in the demand for housing loans is broad-based across countries. Banks expect it to continue, reflecting both the decline in mortgage rates and improving housing market prospects. In the second quarter, the euro area house price index rose for the first time in more than a year (Slide 11, right-hand side).
Return to price stability requires different conduct of monetary policy
All this suggests that we should proceed with caution and remain data-dependent, assessing at each monetary policy meeting whether disinflation remains on track and whether, and to what extent, interest rates remain restrictive. In doing so, we can continuously cross-check the assumptions underlying the staff projections and thereby retain a forward-looking perspective.
This is especially important at a time when past pandemic-related shocks are starting to recede, and new shocks are increasingly driving price and wage dynamics.
This shift in regime – from a high-inflation environment to one where inflation is consistent with price stability – has two important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.[12]
One is that it has a direct impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy.
The success of central banks in paving the way towards restoring price stability after the recent inflation surge has a lot to do with how monetary policy works. In a high-inflation regime, price increases tend to reflect factors common to most goods and services.
This is what has happened in recent years. The common component of inflation rose sharply as firms reacted to the combination of higher energy prices, supply-side bottlenecks and pent-up demand after the pandemic-induced lockdowns. This was reflected in the rapid broadening of inflation pressures across the goods and services contained in the consumption basket (Slide 12).
Ultimately, these shocks affected all sectors of the economy, especially when second-round effects pushed wage demands higher across firms. Wage-price spirals are often the clearest sign of a regime shift, when changes in the general price level become a coordination device for price and wage setters.
As monetary policy affects aggregate demand as well as the inflation expectations of both firms and households, it is powerful in counteracting such common shocks (Slide 13, left-hand side).
As this process is nearing completion and we are re-entering a regime of price stability, idiosyncratic price shocks that reflect relative price changes, and that are mostly independent of each other, will again dominate in driving aggregate inflation.
This is reflected in the measurable decline of the common component.
Idiosyncratic price changes, however, tend to be less responsive to changes in aggregate demand and hence to changes in monetary policy (Slide 13, right-hand side). As a result, monetary policy becomes less effective in steering overall inflation.
Central banks then need to carefully weigh the benefits and costs of trying to lean against relative price shocks. The strongest case for acting is when prices start to co-move again, either because of a new large shock or a series of shocks that move prices in the same direction.
But in the absence of such shocks, policy should be careful not to overreact.
This is especially the case if idiosyncratic shocks reflect structural forces. While it is inherently difficult to separate cyclical from structural factors, surveys among firms suggest that a significant part of the current weakness in parts of our economy relates to forces outside the realm of monetary policy.
In our latest corporate telephone survey, for example, firms reported that the recent decline in business sentiment was driven by growing concerns about political developments, both in Europe and globally, and waning competitiveness amid high energy costs and the green transition.
Firms expressed concerns about rising regulatory costs, such as those resulting from the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). Compliance with these and other directives is seen as complex and resource-intensive, especially for smaller firms.[13]
In other cases, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, there is mounting concern that regulation is increasingly stifling innovation and competition, especially in important areas such as AI.[14]
Particularly in Germany and France, these structural headwinds are causing businesses to postpone, or even refrain from, transformative investments and focus instead on efficiency and cost-cutting, which, in turn, is weighing on consumer confidence and spending.
An expansionary monetary policy stance will change this dynamic only marginally, if at all.
Recent research by Òscar Jordà, Sanjay Singh and Alan Taylor corroborates this view.[15]It shows that, while the effects of tight monetary policy can be persistent, central banks cannot boost potential output by bringing rates into expansionary territory (Slide 14, left-hand side).
And while the benefits of using monetary policy to deal with idiosyncratic shocks are likely to be limited, the welfare costs that it has for society can be significant.
One of the costs is that relative price adjustments support the efficient allocation of resources within the economy. Leaning too strongly against them in the absence of clear risks to price stability may inhibit this process.
The other is that valuable policy space is lost and so will not be available to support employment and growth when the economy faces shocks that monetary policy can deal with more effectively.
This was the case when the pandemic hit. At that time, interest rates were already close to their effective lower bound. As a result, central banks needed to resort to unconventional policy instruments. However, the effectiveness of such measures in stimulating aggregate demand is more uncertain, while their potential side effects are larger.[16]
The second implication is that, when relative price shocks dominate, inflation is largely self-stabilising. As a result, central banks can have a greater tolerance for moderate deviations of inflation from target, in both directions.
The reason is that the impact of changes in aggregate demand on inflation is weaker in an environment in which price changes are largely independent from each other. That is, the Phillips curve is highly non-linear: its slope is often steep when inflation is high, and it is flat when inflation is low.[17]
In this environment, it takes a large shock to aggregate demand for inflation to measurably and persistently drift away from the economy’s nominal anchor – our 2% target. So there is less need for policy to respond to moderate shocks.
This is especially true for disinflationary shocks. Overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that nominal wage cuts are extremely rare and that the frequency at which firms adjust prices lower is highly stable over time (Slide 14, right-hand side).[18]
And when prices and wages do not chase each other as they did over the past years, inflation is largely self-stabilising. As such, the risk of falling into a truly harmful deflationary spiral is limited. Monetary policy can then be more patient and allow inflation to deviate from target for longer than in a situation in which risks of second-round effects are larger.[19]
This can also be seen in the historical properties of commodity price shocks.
When oil prices fell sharply and persistently in 2014, the pass-through to consumer prices and wages was moderate. Underlying inflation, while weak, never fundamentally drifted away from our 2% target.
But in 2022, when inflation was already rising on the back of the repercussions of the pandemic, firms raised their prices considerably and much more frequently than when inflation was low and stable.
Conclusion
Let me now conclude with three main take-aways.
First, price stability is within reach. Considering the risks and uncertainties we are still facing, lowering policy rates gradually towards a neutral level is the most appropriate course of action.
Second, once price stability has been restored in a sustainable manner, the behaviour of inflation will change such that central banks can afford to tolerate moderate deviations of inflation from target, in both directions.
Given limited policy space, monetary policy should focus on responding forcefully to shocks that have the capacity to destabilise inflation expectations by pushing inflation measurably and persistently away from our 2% target over the medium term.
Third, monetary policy is not a supply-side instrument. It cannot resolve structural issues that durably weigh on price pressures, as was the case during the 2010s, when a highly accommodative monetary policy stance over a long period was unable to lift the economy out of the low-growth, low-inflation environment. Structural policies are the responsibility of governments.
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Bank of Lithuania’s Annual Economics Conference on “Pillars of Resilience Amid Global Geopolitical Shifts”, on the occasion of the 10thanniversary of euro introduction, Vilnius, Lithuania
Vilnius, 16 December 2024
It is an honour to be here today to mark 10 years of Lithuania in the euro.
“Laisvė,Vienybė,Gerovė” – freedom, unity and well-being. These are core national values in Lithuania – and accordingly, they are engraved in the edge-lettering on Lithuania’s €2 coin.
Freedom, because of the liberation from Soviet occupation. Unity, because of the need for national solidarity. And well-being, expressing hope for economic and social prosperity.
These three words capture the spirit of the Lithuanian people. And I believe that being part of the euro has strengthened each of them.
The country is now an equal partner in setting monetary policy by one of the world’s most important central banks in the third largest economy, the euro area. That gives Lithuaniafreedomin charting its own macroeconomic destiny that smaller economies cannot typically claim, who often have to import the monetary policy of their larger neighbours.
Lithuania now also issues the world’s second most important reserve and invoicing currency. That providesunityin the face of a more volatile world, as foreign shocks do not penetrate the domestic economy as much, owing to domestic currency invoicing.
Lithuania is especially resilient on this front, invoicing 78% of its exports to non-member countries in euros last year, the fourth highest share across the EU.
And being part of the euro has increased thewell-beingof the Lithuanian people. When Lithuania joined the euro area in 2015, GDP per capita in purchasing power standard terms was around 70% of the euro area average. By 2023, it exceeded 83%.
But more recently, the country has dealt with very high inflation, peaking at 22.5% in September 2022 – more than double the peak seen in the euro area as a whole.
This high-inflation episode has led to a pronounced monetary policy cycle, with the ECB raising rates by 450 basis points, holding them steady for 9 months, and then cutting rates by 100 basis points since June as we entered the “dialling back” phase of our policy.
However, even in this “dialling back” phase, until recently we retained a restrictive bias in our future policy orientation. At our last meeting, we dropped that bias.
Today, I would like to explain what motivated this change and what it implies for the future.
In a nutshell, we have seen the environment change in three important ways that increase our confidence that inflation is returning to our target. These changes concern thepath of inflation, theshocks driving inflationand therisks to inflation.
The path of inflation
The first important change relates to thepath of inflation.
In the earlier part of our monetary policy cycle, the path of inflation was characterised by high uncertainty. We consistently saw the return of inflation to target in our projections being pushed back. At the same time, the incoming inflation data were surprising on the upside, casting further doubt on the accuracy of those projections.
ECB staff models using machine learning[1]indicate that in 2022 and 2023 uncertainty around inflation forecasts was around four to five times higher than in the long-term average.
This uncertainty about the inflation path had implications for the policy horizon – that is, the period within which we want to see inflation converging to our target.
Normally, the medium-term policy horizon is flexible and can be extended depending on the nature, size and persistence of the shocks. But if there is a risk of inflation expectations becoming de-anchored, the horizon must be shortened to the nearest possible date that monetary policy can take effect to prevent that risk materialising – which given normal transmission lags is around two years.
With inflation rising and its return to target continually being pushed back, at a certain point we considered that the risk of de-anchoring had become too high. So, in September 2022 we introduced the notion that the return of inflation to our target had to be “timely”. Our aim was to fix the policy horizon and thereby build confidence among the public that there would be no more delays.
Now, after a lengthy period of restrictive policy, our confidence that we are seeing a “timely” return to target has increased.
Since September last year, we have had six consecutive forecast rounds showing inflation returning to target in the course of 2025. And this arrival date has stayed constant even as we have drawn closer to it.
The uncertainty around these projections has decreased significantly. Our machine learning models now put the uncertainty bands at close to pre-pandemic levels.
The incoming data have, over time, validated the path laid out in the forecasts. Since early 2023, the accuracy of staff projections has returned to the levels seen pre-COVID, especially for headline inflation. While errors for core inflation have taken longer to normalise, this year they have also returned to historical standards.
And this confidence is confirmed in inflation expectations. Among households, median expectations for inflation three years ahead are close to 2%, and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have also fallen in recent months.
The shocks driving inflation
The second change in the environment relates to theshocks driving inflation.
The major challenge for monetary policy during this cycle is that we have faced a sequence of very large shocks which – given staggered wage- and price-setting in the euro area – have transmitted through the economy in persistent and hard-to-forecast ways.
So, even as our confidence in our projections increased, we had to be careful in making our policy stance less restrictive too quickly. We needed a policy framework that would allow us to better understand this complex inflation process. That is why we built our reaction function around our well-known three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission.
Focusing on the dynamics of underlying inflation allowed us to extract more robustly the trend in inflation based on the data we could see in front of us, complementing the information provided by our forecasts.
And for a given inflation path, assessing the strength of monetary transmission allowed us to judge whether our tightening impulse was being passed on through the transmission chain and was thus effective in steering inflation back towards 2%.
This forward-looking framework has provided a way of broadening our information set to capture the pace at which a very large past shock – 10.6% inflation at its peak – was running its course, and how our monetary policy stance was transmitting through the economy and affecting medium-term inflation.
For some time, the signals from underlying inflation were still flagging the risk that inflation might not decline as quickly as indicated in our forecasts. But recently this risk has declined and there is now greater alignment between our forecasts and underlying inflation.
The width of the range of measures of underlying inflation that we monitor has narrowed towards its historical average, with most indicators hovering between 2% and 2.8%, which we take as an indicator of receding uncertainty on future inflation dynamics. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which has the best predictive power for future inflation, has remained at around 2% since the end of last year.
There is one measure that is still above this range, which is domestic inflation, capturing items with a low import content. But this is a year-on-year measures that is made up 97% of services items, and so it is still registering repricing events that took place earlier this year that are keeping services inflation around 4%.
However, if we look at the PCCI for services, which strips out base effects, the measure currently stands at 2.5%. Inflation momentum for services has also dropped steeply recently. These data suggest that there is scope for a downward adjustment in services inflation, and thereby domestic inflation, in the coming months.
Confirming this picture, wage growth – which is the main cost factor driving services – is on a downward trajectory and continues to be buffered by negative growth in unit profits, buffering the pass-through of rising wages to prices.
The ECB wage tracker – which captures wage agreements in seven euro area countries representing around 85% of total wages in the euro area – sees wage growth slowing from 4.8% this year to around 3% in 2025, the level we generally consider to be consistent with our target.
The risks to inflation
The third change in the environment relates to therisks to inflation.
The fact that past shocks were expected to travel slowly along the pricing chain meant that, in recent years, the risks to inflation were mostly to the upside. And despite the progress we have seen in underlying inflation, these risks have not disappeared entirely.
The composition of inflation remains unbalanced, with the recent slowdown being driven mostly by energy inflation, which is particularly volatile, and industrial goods. The adjustment process for slower-moving services inflation is still unfinished. So, we will have to remain watchful until the downward adjustment in services inflation that we expect is confirmed by the data.
However, as past shocks fade, the risks to the inflation outlook have changed. And crucially, these risks are now related more to potential future shocks than to the transmission of past ones.
The main downside risks relate to the weaker-than-expected growth outlook and the increased uncertainty surrounding growth triggered by geopolitical events.
For some time now, we have been seeing small sequential downward revisions to the growth outlook which have cumulatively amounted to a quite significant downgrade over time. For example, if we go back to our June 2023 projections, we expected average growth of 1.5% in 2024. Now, we expect 0.7%.
One driver of this delayed recovery has been sluggish export growth, driven by the competitive challenges facing euro area companies. But the most important driver of our growth forecast misses has been the domestic economy. In fact, around half of the misses since end-2021 relate to investment and a quarter relate to consumption.
The behaviour of investment can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the stronger-than-expected impact of higher interest rates, higher energy prices and structural deterrents. The inertia in consumption has been striking given that the conditions for a recovery are in place. Employment is historically high and real incomes are rising. But households continue to save an unusually high share of their income and take a cautious approach to spending.
One reason for this caution is that many households have a perception of their real income growth that is well below measured data. Just 37% of households in our consumer survey believe that their real income has risen or stayed the same, even though 50% of all households have experienced actual increases. And these households have significantly lower consumption growth than those with correct perceptions.
This pessimism about real incomes is largely driven by past inflation, and so in principle it should dissipate as the high-inflation episode moves further into the rearview mirror.[2]But increasing geopolitical uncertainty could create new dents in household sentiment.
In particular, if the United States – our largest export market – takes a protectionist turn, growth in the euro area is likely to take a hit. Our exporters also specialise in capital goods that other countries use for export production, which makes them particularly sensitive to shifts in confidence about world trade.
The main upside risks we see in the future also relate to external shocks. A rise in geopolitical tensions could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term, while extreme weather events could drive up food prices. The net effect of trade fragmentation and tariffs on inflation remains uncertain, as it involves assumptions that are impossible to anticipate with precision. These include potential retaliatory actions as well as exchange rate and commodity price movements.
Implications for monetary policy
So what does this changing environment mean for our monetary policy? There are three main implications.
The first concerns our currentpolicy stanceand itsfuture orientation.
The current policy stance is restrictive. But if the incoming data continue to confirm our baseline, the direction of travel is clear and we expect to lower interest rates further.
In terms of the future orientation, we previously said that “we will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary”. This bias was necessary in an environment of high realised inflation and high uncertainty about future inflation. But it no longer reflects the evolving macroeconomic landscape, our outlook for inflation or the balance of risks around it.
With the disinflation process well on track, and downside risks to growth, this bias in our communication is no longer warranted. These considerations are reflected in the monetary policy statement adopted by the Governing Council last week. We no longer aim for “sufficiently restrictive” policy, but rather intend to deliver an “appropriate” policy stance.
The second implication for monetary policy concerns ourreaction function.
The high-inflation period has proven the value of the three criteria we have been using to take decisions, which is why the Governing Council confirmed this policy framework at last week’s meeting. And these criteria will be invaluable in the period ahead, even as the risks to inflation move from past shocks to future ones.
In an uncertain environment, we will need to continue complementing our baseline outlook with a rich distribution of possible risks derived from current data. But our framework is flexible, in the sense that we can change the weight we put on the different legs of our reaction function depending on the nature of the shocks we are facing.
For example, if we face large geopolitical shocks that significantly increase uncertainty about the inflation projections, we will need to draw on other sources of data to make the risk assessment surrounding our baseline outlook more robust.
At the same time, the purpose of monitoring underlying inflation is to help us differentiate noise in the inflation data from underlying trends. So, if underlying trends are not affected, it will help increase confidence in the baseline projection.
And assessing monetary transmission will continue to be important, as geopolitical uncertainty may affect monetary transmission by altering the risk appetite of investors, borrowers and financial intermediaries.
The third implication concerns thepolicy horizon.
Even though we are not there yet, we are close to achieving our target. So, we are no longer in a situation where we need to fix the policy horizon at the shortest possible transmission lag. We can return to a situation where the policy horizon can adjust depending on the nature, size and persistence of the shocks as needed.
This change explains why we have removed the notion of “timeliness” from our monetary policy statement, focusing instead on achieving “sustainable” inflation convergence. And it puts us in the best position to react to future shocks.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The Lithuanian poem “The Seasons” (Metai), written by Kristijonas Donelaitis, charts the cyclical nature of the rural life of Lithuanians.
The ECB is also moving through its monetary policy cycle, and we are now at a stage where the darkest days of winter look to be behind us, and we can start to look forward instead.
We certainly hope that the days ahead will be better. But winds are blowing in different directions and there is much uncertainty before us.
So, our monetary policy will be prepared for all scenarios to come.

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 4 December 2024
I am pleased to return to this Committee to discuss the ECB’s monetary policy at such a critical juncture for Europe.
We are witnessing a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape, but also enduring major structural challenges to our economic model.
Europe’s response must be swift. It should focus on spurring investment, fostering innovation and raising productivity. This will require bold policy action and, together with the new European Commission and the Council, this Parliament will have an important role to play.
In my remarks today, I will discuss an important element of this response – the new economic governance framework – which you have chosen as one of the topics of this hearing. But I would like to start by updating you on the ECB’s assessment of the euro area economy and our monetary policy stance.
The economic outlook and the ECB’s monetary policy stance
The euro area saw moderate growth in the first half of this year, following five quarters of stagnation. Real GDP growth was largely driven by exports and government consumption. Domestic private demand remained weak amid high economic policy uncertainty and the effects of past monetary policy tightening. More recently, in the third quarter, real GDP rose by 0.4%, driven in part by temporary factors such as the Paris Olympics. However, survey-based data suggest that growth will be weaker in the short term, on the back of slowing growth in the services sector and a continued contraction in manufacturing. Further ahead, the euro area’s economic recovery should start to gather some steam. Consumer spending is expected to pick up as real incomes rise, and investment is expected to recover as the impact of past monetary policy tightening fades.
The euro area labour market has so far proven resilient. The unemployment rate remained historically low at 6.3% in October, while employment expanded by 300,000 jobs in the third quarter. At the same time, surveys point to slowing employment growth and further moderation in the demand for labour.
The medium-term economic outlook is uncertain, however, and dominated by downside risks. Geopolitical risks are elevated, with growing threats to international trade. High degrees of trade openness and integration into global supply chains make the euro area vulnerable to foreign shocks, with potential trade barriers posing threats to manufacturing and investment.
Turning to inflation, headline inflation increased further to 2.3% in November from 2.0% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. The increase in the last two months – following a deceleration in previous months – was driven mainly by a moderation in the fall in energy prices and an increase in food inflation.
Core inflation – excluding energy and food – remained unchanged at 2.7% in November and is expected to hover around current levels until early 2025. Services inflation remains the biggest contributor to inflation and stood at 3.9% in November, driven in part by recent high wage growth. Overall, growth in labour costs has been moderating in recent quarters – notwithstanding the volatility of negotiated wage growth over the summer – and is set to continue easing. Domestic inflationary pressures are also receding as profits have been buffering still elevated labour cost developments.
Looking ahead, inflation is expected to temporarily increase in the fourth quarter of this year, as previous sharp falls in energy prices drop out of the annual rates, before declining to target in the course of next year.
Let me now turn to our monetary policy stance.
In October the ECB lowered its key interest rates by 25 basis points, following the previous rate cuts in June and September. The information available at our October meeting confirmed that the disinflationary process was well on track. Our deposit facility rate, the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance, now stands at 3.25%.
We will review our stance again next week, following our data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach. We are therefore not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
The new economic governance framework
Let me turn now to the second topic you have chosen for our hearing today – the EU’s new economic governance framework.
Fiscal policy is essential to address the multiple challenges Europe is currently facing, ranging from the green and digital transitions to economic security and defence. But for fiscal policy to be credible and powerful, it also needs to rest on strong foundations.
The EU’s new economic governance framework strikes a balance between ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability and fostering strategic investments and growth-enhancing reforms.
If implemented effectively, it will provide three major benefits.
First, it can help address the challenges related to elevated debt levels, which have partly arisen from policies designed to buffer the impact of recent crises across the economy. The framework focuses on debt sustainability, thereby also supporting monetary policy transmission.
Second, the framework strives to balance gradual and sustained fiscal consolidation with incentives for much-needed investment and structural reforms. It introduces the possibility of extending fiscal adjustment paths from four to seven years. Such extensions are contingent on growth-enhancing investments and reforms being implemented, which would in turn further strengthen debt sustainability by raising potential growth. Reducing high debt levels also increases the space for strategic investments at the national and European levels.
Third, the new framework can help to make the fiscal stance more countercyclical, smoothing out economic fluctuations and thereby supporting long-term growth in conditions of price stability.
Implementing the revised economic governance framework fully and transparently is thus key to safeguarding Member States’ capacity to invest now and in the future.
The challenges we face also require us to rethink the EU’s role in addressing strategic investment needs. As Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi observed in their reports, Europe is currently falling short of its potential.
A key idea running through the reports is that Europe is bigger than its constituent parts. Well-defined joint EU investments would boost potential growth and contribute to macroeconomic stability. They would allow us to harness economies of scale and address cross-border challenges, to the benefit of all Europeans, adding value beyond what national investments could achieve alone. They would also send a strong signal of unity to private investors within and outside the EU.
Such investments must be accompanied by coordinated and ambitious reform efforts. At the EU level, completing the capital markets union, which we discussed in my previous hearing before this committee, and deepening the Single Market are essential. Member States also play a crucial role in reducing obstacles to entrepreneurship, helping firms to innovate and grow and aiding the efficient allocation of capital and labour. Progress towards closer European integration paired with national reform efforts is essential for a more dynamic and competitive economy – one that supports citizens’ standards of living and enables businesses to thrive.
Conclusion
Let me now conclude.
Europe’s geopolitical and structural challenges require coordinated and determined action from policymakers. As the Greek storyteller Aesop wisely said, “In union there is strength”, and citizens’ trust in the European Union is at its highest level in over 15 years.[1]The Commission has set an ambitious policy agenda to tackle these challenges, which you have endorsed. It is now up to you to make it happen. The ECB will play its role in supporting Europe’s longer-term sustainable growth by fulfilling its mandate of price stability.
Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to your questions."

Remarks by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 25th Anniversary of the Euro50 Group event at the Banque de France
Paris, 28 November 2024
Let me start by congratulating the Euro50 Group on its 25th anniversary: since the start of the euro, the Euro50 Group has convened many important discussions about the development of the euro area as a monetary union and the euro as a single currency.
Looking back at the first quarter of a century of the Euro50 Group naturally invites speculation about the next 25 years: what will we be discussing at the 50th anniversary of the Euro50 Group?
Let me list four major structural factors that look set to shape the next 25 years:[1](a) the next wave of technological change (digitalisation, artificial intelligence, automation, robotification);[2](b) climate change, nature degradation and the green transition;[3](c) the shifting configuration of geo-economics and geo-politics;[4]and (d) demographic trends (increasing longevity, low fertility, migration patterns).[5]Of course, these structural factors interact with each other in many ways, such that it is essential to adopt a holistic approach in assessing their implications for societies, economies, political systems, governments, institutions – including central banks – and policymakers.[6]
Before turning to how a central bank should respond to these structural changes, I want first to emphasise that the common nature of these structural trends means that international coordination and collective action is the best approach to navigating these challenges. At the European level, there is considerable scope to work together as a European Union. In terms of economic and financial policy, the recent Draghi and Letta reports show how further integration can improve both the dynamism and the resilience of Europe, which would make it much easier to deal with the challenges I have just mentioned.[7]This includes the high potential gains in stepping up progress in relation the capital markets union and the banking union.[8]
First, a basic task is to analyse these developments: strong analytical foundations are a precondition for good policymaking. Of course, the primary focus of the analytical work should be to assess the implications of these structural trends for the central bank. This spans not only the implications for inflation dynamics but also the role of money in the economy and the financial system and the modalities of monetary policy implementation. The full arsenal of analytical firepower needs to be deployed: research projects to uncover evidence about structural change in the incoming data; a greater use of surveys to find out how households, firms and financial intermediaries are coping with structural change; and the tracing-out of various scenarios in the “laboratories” provided by macroeconomic models.[9]
Second, a forward-looking central bank should update and modify the tools and modalities of how it underpins the monetary system and implements monetary policy.
In relation to the former, the digital euro project is devoted to ensuring that the euro area can benefit from the full potential of a digitised financial system while preserving, even in the new digital world, the security and freedom provided by central bank money.[10]The gains from a digital euro extend far beyond the personal benefits that will be reaped by individual European citizens from a digital currency that can be used wherever digital payments are accepted, throughout the euro area. The digital euro will also introduce an alternative to the currently-dominant international payment solutions, both reducing our external dependencies and lowering costs for merchants. And it will provide the underlying infrastructural platform and acceptance network that can level the playing field for euro area banks, payment providers and payment schemes in offering a wide range of financial services across the euro area.
In relation to the latter, the ECB is working to ensure that its policy toolkit and implementation framework are aligned with the EU policy commitments to the green transition.[11]It goes without saying that we closely assess the various elements of this work programme to make sure these do not compromise our commitment to delivering our primary mandate of price stability.[12]
Third, a central bank should work through the implications of structural change for price stability. Structural changes can affect not only inflation dynamics, but also the natural rate of interest, and therefore can have important consequences for the central bank’s price stability mandate.[13]At a heuristic level, it is important to differentiate between different pathways. Without trying to be comprehensive, let’s consider a few scenarios:
Scenario A: This may have little impact on inflation: loosely speaking, if demand and supply adapt at the same speed, the net impact on inflation is limited.
Scenario B: news arrives about a future structural shift. If the news is good – future supply capacity improves – this can stimulate investment and raise consumption today, in line with the permanent income hypothesis. Since demand improves but short-run supply is limited, this may create a burst of short-run inflation. In the other direction, if the news is bad – future supply capacity declines – this constitutes a negative demand shock today, which is disinflationary. In either case, whether monetary policy should respond will depend on the expected size and duration of the inflation shock, together with an assessment of the fragility of the inflation anchor to the shock.
Scenario C: a disruptive event occurs today. This could be an adverse disruptive event (a pandemic, a trade war, an actual war) that generates an unexpected contraction in supply capacity. In the other direction, it could also take the form of a faster-than-expected roll-out of a general purpose technology, such as the 1990s internet boom in the United States). In the case of an adverse shock, supply falling more quickly than demand creates inflationary pressure; in the case of a positive shock, supply increasing more quickly than demand eases inflationary pressure. Of course, both types of disruptive event may also have implications for financial stability, in view of the associated implications for asset pricing.
In essence, the challenge for central bankers will be to calculate and re-calculate the appropriate monetary policy stance that is robust to the emergence of these various scenarios or combinations of scenarios: at any given time, there may be elements of scenarios A, B and C operating in different sectors and in different countries, given the wide variety of structural changes that are underway.[14]"

Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Bank of England Watchers’ Conference 2024, King’s College London
London, 25 November 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to explain how uncertainty is incorporated in the monetary policy process at the ECB.[1][2]While monetary policy makers have always had to grapple with uncertainty, recent years have been marked by a pronounced increase in the quantum of uncertainty. This includes the uncertainties related to the pandemic and the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine (Chart 1). It also includes the uncertainties related to technological change, geo-economic trends and the green transition.[3]In this speech, I will discuss how the ECB incorporates risk and uncertainty in its forecasting, in the preparation of monetary policy decisions and in communication.[4]
Events such as the global financial crisis, the pandemic and wars are inherently unpredictable. And, even once such an event has occurred, its ultimate impact on the economy is very difficult to work out. A prime example is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. By triggering extraordinary jumps in gas and oil prices, and by creating a generalised sense of insecurity, this conflict was a major driver of the recent surge in inflation and also brought geo-political risk considerations to the fore. The scale and duration of the conflict have had wider ramifications for the euro area economy, also prompting difficult questions about the appropriate scale of defence spending and the management of the economic and social impact of refugee flows.
One “uncertainty tracker” is the risk index developed by ECB staff based on importance of the different risks articulated in the earnings calls of publicly-traded euro area companies (Chart 2). While this summary indicator shows some decline in risk intensity recently, primarily due to a decline in uncertainty related to macroeconomic developments and supply chain disruptions, it remains above pre-pandemic levels.[5]
Yet even in quieter periods not featuring extraordinary events, uncertainty is an inherent aspect of decision making in economics. The fundamental unpredictability of the future creates a cone of multiple possible outcomes, each with its own set of implications. Uncertainty may also stem from environments that cannot be observed or characterised in their entirety when incomplete information adds another layer of unpredictability.
There is a long history to the challenge of incorporating uncertainty into economic decision making. Economists and policymakers have long recognised that the economy is subject to shocks and that human behaviour, which underpins economic activity and shapes collective reactions to the shocks, is inherently unpredictable.
Some economists have argued that individuals and markets can, on average, formulate an accurate risk distribution over future events by using all available information.[6]In this way, uncertainty can be captured in standard macroeconomic models by the use of probability distributions around different outcomes or scenarios, which can either be measured directly or estimated (for example, from financial options markets). Even when risks can be measured and quantified, the way in which this affects economic decisions may be highly complex and non-linear, as emphasised by complexity theory.[7]
In this context, it can be useful to distinguish between what is often called ‘risk’ – which can be modelled via known calculable probabilities – and Knightian uncertainty, where there is no objective basis for deriving probabilities and one may not even be able to delineate the space of all the circumstances that can occur. Under this Knightian form of uncertainty, risks are not known or even knowable, making them impossible to quantify and forecast. This distinction has its foundations in seminal works by Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes.[8]
Decision-making under this type of uncertainty may not be well captured by our standard models. For example, developments in behavioural economics have shown that cognitive biases can significantly affect decision-making under uncertainty.[9]Other strands of research have demonstrated that relying on simple heuristics can be a boundedly-rational response in complex environments.[10]Under this type of uncertainty, the development of scenarios, and application of judgment about possible outcomes in the future, can complement models and help policymakers adjust and adapt policy action when needed.
These considerations highlight the importance of practitioners taking a nuanced approach towards risk management. A comprehensive approach calls for the adoption of robust strategies consistent with a wide range of risk scenarios. In addition, policy should acknowledge the limits of predictability and follow an adaptive approach, leaving enough room for manoeuvre when faced with genuine surprises.[11]
With this in mind, I will use the remainder of my time to explain the broad range of strategies that are used at the ECB to quantify and incorporate risk and uncertainty into macroeconomic forecasting and in making monetary policy decisions. I will also discuss how risk and uncertainty are articulated in the monetary policy communication of the ECB.
Uncertainty about the economy and monetary transmission
The inflation surges in the euro area during 2021 and 2022 resulted from a sequence of large shocks, which also precipitated a significant burst of uncertainty. These shocks related both to the longer-term fallout from the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with demand rotating across sectors in an environment in which some key segments of the economy were supply constrained. In addition, the war-induced subsequent surges in energy prices infiltrated the entire price chain.
Macroeconomic projections are a key input to forward-looking monetary policy decision making. But forecasting models – which embed economic relations based on historical regularities and typically struggle to handle pervasive uncertainty – naturally faced significant challenges during this period. From the middle of 2021 to early 2023, this challenge was visible in the scale of realised forecast errors for both headline and core inflation, as well as real GDP growth (Chart 3). During this period, the significant forecast inaccuracies were driven by pandemic-related bottlenecks and the dramatic surges in energy and commodity prices. But shifts in how these shocks were transmitted to inflation, including owing partly to pandemic reopening effects, also played an important role in the broadening of the inflation shock, increasing its size and persistence.[12]
Faced with these major events that challenged our existing processes, models and forecasts, the ECB has developed strategies to support decision-making in managing and mitigating uncertainty. I turn to these strategies in the next section.
In general, central banks make monetary policy decisions on the basis of two factors: first, the “most likely” (or baseline) projection for inflation and output; and, second, the risk profile surrounding this expected path. In guiding the disinflation process since the inflation peak in late 2022, the most prominent risks facing the ECB were: (i) in the context of extraordinarily-high inflation, there was a wide distribution of possible inflation paths, such that the weight attached to the baseline projection in updating beliefs about inflation dynamics was naturally lower than normal, with a corresponding step up in the attention paid to the realised path of underlying inflation; and (ii) in the context of a steep rate hiking cycle (especially after an extended low-for-long monetary environment), there was considerable uncertainty about the strength of monetary policy transmission. These risks were best managed by adopting a three-pronged reaction function encompassing both information from staff projections and cross-checking information from a variety of sources. Since March 2023, the Governing Council has communicated that it is particularly attentive to: (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook; (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation; and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission.[13]
This strategy has proved its value in ensuring an orderly disinflation process by setting the interest rate path to deliver a timely return of inflation to the target. In particular, by systematically considering all three elements of the reaction function and weighting them appropriately, the Governing Council could better calibrate monetary policy in the face of unpredictable, sometimes contradictory information.[14]This three-pronged reaction function can be understood as a heuristic for simultaneously managing multiple sources of uncertainty during the disinflation process, both in relation to inflation dynamics and the transmission of monetary policy.[15]
The first element of the reaction function is the inflation outlook, which can be understood to encompass both the “most likely” future path for inflation and the surrounding risk assessment. The assessment of the inflation outlook is based on the incoming economic and financial data. The quarterly staff macroeconomic projection exercise is a central input into this assessment, as it aggregates a vast amount of information that would otherwise be hard to map into a coherent profile of the future path for inflation and output. At the “in between” non-projection meetings, the incoming information is best interpreted through the lens of the latest projection round, either validating or casting doubt on these projections. In synthesis, our assessment evolves according to a Bayesian-style updating process, with priors at inter-projection meetings pinned down by the latest projections and incoming statistics helping to update the picture. Chart 4 shows the path of inflation as foreseen in the September staff projections.
Measures of underlying inflation provide a useful alternative perspective in assessing inflation dynamics, especially in times of elevated uncertainty.[16]Measures of underlying inflation aim to filter out the short-term volatility in headline inflation to better capture the low-frequency component of inflation. Accordingly, such measures provide a sense of where headline inflation is likely to settle in the medium term, once temporary factors have dissipated.
Unlike headline inflation, many measures of underlying inflation are not directly observable and must be estimated. In times of uncertainty, examining a range of measures of underlying inflation is particularly important, since no single measure is a perfect proxy for medium-term inflation trends. Such an approach ensures that no individual measure is over-emphasised as being higher or lower in any given period. The range across different measures of underlying inflation also provides an indication of the level of uncertainty, as can be seen from the wide range during 2022 and 2023 and its recent narrowing (Chart 5).
At the same time, the major economic disruptions of recent years also meant that the standard set of underlying inflation measures became less informative for medium-term inflation developments. In particular, the bottleneck and energy shocks exerted a significant persistent-but-not-permanent impact on such measures, such that the standard measures likely over-stated the scale of the increase in the underlying inflation component.
Accordingly, ECB staff also developed complementary “adjusted’’ measures of underlying inflation that filtered out the exceptional influences from supply chain bottlenecks and energy price shocks in the post-pandemic recovery.[17]When adjusting for these shocks, the peak of underlying inflation measures was lower, and the range was narrower, during the high inflation period (Chart 5). With the fading of the bottleneck and energy shocks, the gap between the adjusted and standard measures of underlying inflation has declined.
The third element of our reaction function seeks to capture the inherent uncertainty in how monetary policy is transmitted to financing conditions, the broader economy, and ultimately inflation. The reason for these uncertainties – explicitly recognised in the 2021 monetary policy strategy statement, which emphasises the “lags and uncertainty in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and to inflation” – lies in the ever-evolving nature of financial intermediation. Together with the scale of the shocks hitting the economy and the speed and scale of the monetary policy tightening cycle, the state-contingent responses of banks and other intermediaries influence how strongly policies are transmitted to the broad economy.
At the start of the tightening cycle, it was not obvious how forcefully increases in the key policy rates would be transmitted along the yield curve and to broader financing conditions.[18]That is why, in accordance with the data-dependent approach, it was important to carefully check the evolution of bank funding costs, borrowing costs for households and firms, and credit growth. These statistics (which arrive only with a lag) were complemented with additional insights from other sources. These include the bank lending survey (BLS), which captures changes in credit standards and credit demand from households and businesses, and the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), which provides firm-level perspectives on credit availability and demand for loans. Taken together, the BLS and the SAFE provide a useful comparison between the two sides of the market for bank credit: lenders (vis-à-vis firms and households in the BLS) and corporate borrowers (in the SAFE).[19]Monitoring the strength of transmission in real time has been important in helping us calibrate and adjust the degree of restrictiveness necessary to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target in a timely manner.
Overall, the evidence suggests that the transmission of monetary policy has been forceful and stronger than the historical pattern.[20]The strength of transmission and the disinflationary response probably reflects the commitment and forcefulness of the monetary policy response to the inflation surge, which not only steered actual borrowing costs to levels that weighed on demand, but also contributed to keeping inflation expectations anchored throughout this difficult time.[21]In addition, there is some suggestive evidence that the impact of monetary policy shocks on highly sensitive components of core inflation appears to be stronger when including the most recent hiking cycle (Chart 6).In addition, the simultaneous international central bank response to the global surge in inflation amplified the impact of monetary policy on inflation.[22]
Beyond the baseline forecast
While the three-pronged reaction function of the Governing Council can be seen as an overarching strategy towards handling uncertainty about the economy and monetary transmission in the context of a major inflation shock and a significant monetary policy tightening cycle, staff also employ several techniques to identify and quantify the risks around the baseline projections. In this section, I will discuss some of these tools, but this should not be understood as an exhaustive list of the full set of sensitivity exercises that are run routinely at the ECB to chart out the range of plausible outcomes, conditional on the current state of information.
A good starting point is to use past forecast errors as a guide to quantifying uncertainty looking into the future, since projection errors can be interpreted as a catch-all proxy of all of the different sources of past uncertainty. At the ECB, these forecast errors are used to create fan charts based on ranges, with the width of such intervals calibrated to be twice the mean absolute value of past errors, excluding outliers.[23]The distribution is assumed to be perfectly symmetric, so no information is provided on the balance of risks. Uncertainty is illustrated through three different ranges, representing prediction intervals of 30%, 60% and 90%. These intervals indicate the probability that future observations will fall within these ranges if the typical shocks from the past, excluding exceptional events, were to occur again in the future. Knightian uncertainty is, therefore, ruled out by assumption.
A fan chart is a simple way to visualise, interpret and communicate forecast uncertainty based on past projection errors (Chart 7). It is a useful instrument for conveying complex information both to the Governing Council and in external communication. However, their construction based on historical data may lead to an incomplete picture of future uncertainties, especially in the face of atypical, asymmetric and outsized risks. In addition, fan charts do not explain which risks might affect the economy or the underlying mechanisms governing how the risks may travel through the economy. This lack of a narrative can leave policymakers without crucial insights into the underlying drivers of uncertainty about the inflation and growth outlook.
Another method traditionally employed at the ECB to quantify forecast uncertainty is the application of subjective probability distributions. In each forecasting round, a survey is conducted among senior staff, which yields subjective probability distributions around the inflation and growth projections based on methods to aggregate their individual opinions into a collective judgement.[24]These experts also rank the risks and uncertainties that they consider to be most important, with the results reported to the Governing Council in a structured manner and discussed in the context of the risk outlook. This approach is transparent and easy to interpret for the Governing Council. It is also forward-looking and linked to tangible risks currently on the minds of staff, allowing us to anticipate different environments that may materialise in the future and understand which risks might be driving the distribution. At the same time, there is inherent subjectivity in this process, which means that the associated probability distributions are not entirely derived from empirical data. In addition, while individual risks are ranked, the specific mechanisms through which those risks could affect the economy remain unclear.
A model-based approach to quantifying macroeconomic risks is attractive, since it allows us to examine how current developments steer the entire distribution of future macroeconomic outcomes. This approach is inspired by a growing body of literature known as ‘macro-at-risk’.[25]At the ECB, staff have developed various macro-at-risk models to explore the way specific indicators influence the tail risks surrounding future real GDP growth and inflation.
One example is given by inflation-at-risk models that help us assess the potential risks to our inflation projections by estimating the probability distribution of future inflation outcomes at different points in time. The September projections indicated small downside risks to the 2024 HICP projections, although over a longer horizon such inflation-at-risk models still identified non-negligible upside risks (Chart 8).
Another example of a macro-at-risk approach generates a path for the tails of the distributions for future macroeconomic variables by conditioning on monetary and financial developments. The resulting model-based estimates indicate that both upside and downside risks to growth in the coming years are consistent with historical patterns (Chart 9, left panel).
It is also possible to extract insights from the joint distribution of inflation and GDP. Recent exercises have indicated that, by end-2026, the probability of inflation undershooting the target is now greater than the probability of overshooting. High inflation realisations are more likely to occur in a context of subpar GDP growth, indicating that adverse supply shocks remain the primary source of upside risk to inflation (Chart 9, right panel).
Conditioning assumptions for the future evolution of key input variables are an important component of the ECB and Eurosystem staff projections. For example, the paths for inputs such as commodity prices, including oil and gas prices, are based on market expectations at the time of the projection cut-off date. Since market expectations are themselves variable (as markets continuously reassess the likely path of commodity valuations in response to news), staff systematically quantify the sensitivity of our baseline to changes in these assumptions.
For oil and gas prices, alternative paths are derived using percentiles of option-implied neutral densities, while staff additionally consider a constant-price assumption. We can illustrate this approach taking our September projections as the point of departure. At that time, oil prices were close to symmetrically distributed around the baseline assumption, indicating broadly balanced risks (Chart 10). However, the gas price distribution highlighted upside risks, probably reflecting adverse geopolitical developments such as escalating tensions in the Middle East and the incursion of Ukrainian troops into Russian territory. Staff modelled the effects on our projections of assuming the 25thpercentile of these distributions, the 75thpercentile, and constant prices. The findings from the September exercise indicated an upside skew to inflation risks but limited, balanced risks for GDP growth from the possible alternative paths for energy prices (Table 1).
These sensitivity analyses are performed on different assumptions for market prices and are easy to interpret and communicate. These are also forward-looking in that they take account of current market conditions and expectations, providing a more relevant assessment of future risks stemming from the variables in focus, than approaches based purely on past projection errors. However, market-based sensitivity analyses can only quantify risks from a limited subset of factors. And while these offer statistical insights, these do not condition on the fundamental forces driving a given shift in market prices.
This approach can also be augmented by using model-based density forecasts that do not just consider individual percentiles of option-implied densities but instead exploit the full distribution. This information can be incorporated into macroeconomic models using conditional density forecasting techniques. By imposing the forecasting density of one variable in the model, staff can explore how the densities of other variables react, with any asymmetric risks being inherited by the model. Chart 11 gives an example from the September projections exercise.[26]Options-implied energy price forecasting densities imply upside risks to inflation and downside risks to real economic activity, mainly towards the end of the projection horizon.
Model-based density forecasts can also be valuable in identifying and quantifying specific sources of projection uncertainty and anticipating future economic conditions, based on current market expectations. But these forecasts are not easy to communicate. The complexity of the models and the technical nature of the results can make it challenging to present insights clearly to policymakers. These forecasts also face model uncertainty and might struggle to capture the dynamics of future uncertainty, especially if there are structural changes in the economy. Finally, these can still only consider a limited subset of factors.
By tracing out the implications of a particular configuration of risks, scenario analysis provides another approach for communicating that the baseline is surrounded by a wide range of alternative future paths. Prior to the pandemic, staff conducted occasional scenario analysis, for example to model the implications of rare and unfamiliar occurrences, such as a no-deal Brexit. From March 2020 onwards, the ECB used this approach more intensively to navigate the turbulent waters of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. In each projection round, various scenarios of topical relevance are considered, with recent exercises covering, inter alia, an escalation of tensions in the Middle East and alternative scenarios for the evolution of labour productivity.
In some ways, scenario analysis is attractive in terms of interpretation and communication. It is particularly helpful in providing a narrative that explains how the crystallisation of a particular risk, or a constellation of inter-linked risks, might affect the economy. Scenario analysis is also naturally forward looking. It allows us to consider, and to some extent account for, various emerging challenges and potential future worlds. By focusing on the implications of particular scenarios even when it is very difficult to attach probabilities to their occurrence, it can also help to confront Knightian uncertainty.
At the same time, especially if not contextualised, an indiscriminate presentation of many scenarios might excessively shift the focus of attention away from the likeliest outcome towards hypothetical sets of circumstances that might only have a small probability of being realised. In the other direction, focusing on a too-small set of scenarios might divert attention from other looming risks.
One specific scenario analysis performed in the context of our September 2024 projections exercise was to explore the implications of potential shocks to consumer confidence.[27]This analysis used a semi-structural model to assess how unexpected changes in consumer confidence might affect household decisions on consumption, saving and housing investment. It then examined the broader implications for economic activity and inflation using a structural model.
Consumer confidence has been volatile since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and it has remained subdued despite some recent recovery (Chart 12). This scenario analysis explored three possibilities for the evolution of consumer confidence. A “lower confidence” scenario assumed that consumer confidence would deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2024 and remain weak, likely due to increasing geopolitical uncertainty. When simulated through the model, this resulted in an increase in the saving ratio for precautionary reasons, also leading to a decline in housing investment. The “higher confidence” scenario reflected the polar case of improving confidence, likely related to rising real incomes. Finally, a “temporarily lower confidence” scenario assumed that the initial decline in consumer confidence would be followed by a rebound in the third quarter of 2025, so that the saving ratio would initially increase above the baseline but would later converge back to the baseline.
The results indicated that, in the “lower confidence” scenario, real GDP growth would be 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points below the baseline in 2025 and 2026, respectively (Table 2). This scenario would also have a negative impact on private consumption and employment growth. In the “temporarily lower confidence” scenario, real GDP growth would see a cumulative deviation of -0.1 percentage points from the baseline over 2024-2026, with larger effects on private consumption. By contrast, GDP growth would be naturally above the baseline in the “higher confidence” scenario. In all scenarios there was only a very limited impact on the inflation outlook, due to the choice of shocks, which only directly have an impact on quantities, and a relatively flat Phillips curve in the model used for the scenario analysis.
Calibration of monetary policy
The calibration of monetary policy is the next step the Governing Council needs to take after thoroughly analysing the risks and uncertainties surrounding the economy, as well as the strength of monetary transmission. Here, I will focus on a set of model-based policy simulations that are useful in informing our decision-making in an uncertain environment by exploring the potential outcomes of various policy actions, mainly over a short horizon. I will also say a few words about how risk management considerations have informed some of the recent policy decisions of the Governing Council.
Model-based policy simulations utilise a suite of structural or semi-structural macroeconomic models, the transmission channels of which represent state-of-the-art knowledge about the workings of the economy. These models allow us to implement different interest rate paths compared to the baseline market-based interest rate path that is embedded in the projections. This exercise lends robustness to our policy choices in the face of economic uncertainty and model uncertainty. As an illustration of this approach, I will revisit a policy exercise that staff conducted ahead of the June 2024 Governing Council.
The June projections were predicated on market expectations that entailed a cumulative 75 basis point cut in the deposit facility rate by the end of 2024. Policy simulations allowed us to assess three possible profiles that differed in the number of rate cuts by the end of 2024. All profiles assumed a 25 basis point cut in June 2024, which, by the time the exercise was conducted, was seen as highly likely by the market. The baseline (“intermediate”) profile implied two further 25 basis point cuts in the third and fourth quarters, resulting in a deposit facility rate of 3.25% by year-end, broadly in line with the market-based rate profile at the time. The most restrictive profile (“later”) implemented only a single further 25 basis point rate cut in the fourth quarter of 2024. The most accommodative (“earlier”) profile assumed a cumulative 50 basis point cut in Q3 2024, followed by another 25 basis point cut in Q4 2024.[28]All three scenarios were extended from the start of 2025 onwards along a trajectory dictated by an estimated reaction function that mapped the projected macroeconomic conditions into a rate response.
The implications of these alternative policy paths for inflation in 2024, 2025 and 2026, using three different models and based on the state of knowledge available in June 2024, are shown in Chart 13.[29]The most restrictive rate profile was effective in bringing inflation down to levels close to 2% in 2025, though with some dispersion of results across models. However, this rate profile could lead to a noticeable inflation undershoot in 2026. Conversely, the most accommodative profile was consistent with somewhat higher inflation in 2025. At a longer horizon, however, this policy trajectory would still deliver an inflation rate of 1.9%. Intuitively, because of its close alignment with the rate profile underlying the June projections, the intermediate profile was seen as delivering an outlook for inflation very close to the projection baseline.
Beyond the central tendency of the staff projections and variations in the policy rate around the benchmark market curve, we also consider the performance of a range of possible interest rates paths under alternative macroeconomic forecasts. This supports robust policy making in the face of uncertainty and is particularly important during times of significant economic volatility. I will illustrate this robustness test in a stylised exercise.
A policy is defined as robust according to the min-max criterion, if it avoids the worst case scenario across a specified set of macroeconomic environments and policy tactics.[30]To illustrate this, let me describe an exercise in robust control where a structural model is used to simulate three environments: one based on the model's estimated parameters; the second reflecting a worsening trade-off between inflation and output due to large supply shocks (“persistent inflation”); and the third increasing the role of demand shocks and increasing the impact of interest rates on the real economy to capture the unusual post-pandemic demand pressure and possibly amplified policy transmission.[31]Next, for each environment staff compute the associated optimal simple rule: the policy rule that maximises the policymaker’s objectives as defined by a loss function.[32]Then each of the optimal policy rules is deployed in each of the three environments and the losses are computed according to the stipulated loss function. Finally, policy performance is compared, as measured by these model-based loss calculations, across the different environments using a min-max strategy. Note that this approach abstracts from considering whether any particular environment is more or less likely to materialise than any other.
The first two environments are captured by the four cells in the top left corner of Table 3. A min-max strategy tries to avoid the outcome with the worst loss, which would be realised by following the baseline optimal policy (top row) in a “persistent inflation” environment (second column). Thus, a min-max approach suggests that, in the face of this particular source of uncertainty, it is advisable to generally implement a more forceful response to inflation, as indicated by the “persistent inflation” optimal policy (second row).
However, when considering all three environments (i.e. also including the third row and third column in Table 3), the largest loss arises when the “persistent inflation” policy (second row) is applied in the amplification environment (third column) and the baseline reaction is rather to be preferred from a min-max perspective.[33]
In summary, even a relatively simple model such as the one used to produce this exercise, can be helpful to policymakers in that it broadens their view of a whole range of possibilities – some expected, some undesirable – that may emerge as a result of their choices.
This highlights the value attached to broadening the information base on which the Governing Council takes decisions and systematically asking “what if” type of questions in the spirit of robust control to test our policy responses. In line with this insight, our meeting-by-meeting approach provides flexibility to respond nimbly to sudden shifts in the environment.
Risk management considerations have influenced some of the recent policy decisions of the Governing Council. For example, one motivation for the final interest rate hike in September 2023 was taking out insurance against a scenario in which the process of gradual disinflation that we were already observing at the time could stall or even reverse. The Governing Council came to the conclusion that it was safer to confront such a scenario with interest rates at 4% rather than 3.75%. An additional hike would reinforce progress towards our target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolved according to the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation will return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path. It followed that, all else equal, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.
Precautionary risk management considerations also played an important role in motivating our latest monetary policy decision in October. If the slowdown signalled by recent economic activity indicators and the below target inflation print in September prove to be temporary, a decision to cut rates in October could, ex post, turn out as merely having brought forward a December cut. By contrast, if the recent data signalled a more persistent weakness, which confirms a stronger disinflationary process, cutting in October would, ex post, signal a nimble adjustment of policy to changing macroeconomic conditions. Retaining full optionality was therefore important and acted as a hedge against the materialisation of risks in either direction to the growth and inflation outlook. Communication should therefore continue to refrain from giving guidance about the speed and scale of monetary easing at future meetings.
Remaining open-minded about the speed and scale of adjustments is in fact a valuable strategy across various environments, as different situations may necessitate distinct approaches. Our confidence in a return of inflation to target has been growing for some time and, in response, we have gradually reduced our policy rates over the past months. This cautious approach, rooted in the principle of gradualism, emphasises moving incrementally when faced with uncertainty about the impact of our actions on the economy – after all, we cannot be certain that monetary transmission will retain its increased strength documented in the analysis presented earlier in this speech, or return to pre-pandemic elasticities.[34]This careful, step-by-step strategy enables us to observe the responses of the economy to our decisions and continuously refine our understanding of their impacts.
At the same time, gradualism is not a universal principle, as certain circumstances demand a more forceful response.[35]In fact, a prominent lesson can be drawn from our rate tightening measures at the onset of this policy cycle. After an initial phase when the persistence of the inflation surge was unclear and gradualism was one of our guiding principles, we swiftly moved out of negative territory and increased our policy rates in quick succession once it became clearer that persistence was indeed high, risking an upside de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Forceful rate actions (a pair of 75 basis point hikes in September and October 2022, followed by a triple of 50 basis points hikes between December 2022 and March 2023) were the appropriate response to avoid the risk that inflation expectations might de-anchor and, by dampening demand, to limit the scale and duration of second-round adjustments to the initial inflation shocks. Model-based estimates suggest that our decisive policy response reduced inflation rates by approximately two percentage points on average in each year between 2023 and 2026. Crucially, our rate decisions during this time helped to keep de-anchoring risks under control.[36]
Taken together, we are best served by making decisions in a state-dependent manner, taking into account the specific circumstances at hand. This flexible, meeting-by-meeting approach ensures that we remain responsive to the ever-changing economic landscape, enhancing our ability to effectively achieve our policy objectives.
Communication
To steer the economy through the current challenging times, a central bank needs to manage expectations – not only about inflation, but also about risks and uncertainties that can have major effects on our economy. By clearly conveying our economic outlook, risk assessment and policy decisions, we can help to reduce uncertainty and stabilise inflation expectations.
In this respect, as stressed in our 2021 Monetary Policy Strategy Statement, effective communication is a priority for us. In order to ensure that the message reaches its recipients and is well understood, we have been adjusting our language and expanding our communication channels. The monetary policy statement, published after each monetary policy meeting, is the principal channel through which the collective voice of the Governing Council reaches specialised economic observers and the public at large. The text needs to be made accessible to both constituencies. Indeed, the complexity of the statement, as measured by standard text analysis metrics, has decreased substantially (Chart 14). To further improve the understanding of our communication among non-technical audiences, we follow a layered approach, whereby the monetary policy statement is complemented by visual summaries laying out the essentials of our assessment about the economy and our policy choices.
An important part of the monetary policy statement is the risk assessment section. This systematically highlights the Governing Council’s collective view on potential upside and downside risks to economic growth and inflation, drawing on the various factors analysed by staff using the methods and approaches discussed in this speech. As such, this section highlights particular uncertainties that the Governing Council identifies as surrounding the future outlook and provides some sense of how policy might need to be altered should different risks crystallise. Being transparent about alternative sets of circumstances that may push the economy onto trajectories that are different and possibly far from baseline does not mean necessarily being precise about the balance of those forces oftentimes pulling key macroeconomic variables in opposite directions.
Stressing state dependency and optionality, in line with the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach, can help to avoid embracing a view or a policy approach, which could reduce our room for manoeuvre in conditions that we were unable to anticipate.[37]This ability to react flexibly is likely to be particularly useful when economic outcomes are dynamic and there is high uncertainty surrounding the outlook for inflation.
Conclusion
As I have laid out today, our monetary policy decisions are supported by a broad range of staff analyses on risks and contingencies, as well as through comprehensive simulations of monetary policy and stance scenarios. By effectively communicating our policy decisions and risk assessment, we enhance transparency and maintain public trust in our policy actions. And it is essential that we are agile in responding to risks that might crystallise and new uncertainties that might emerge.
Our approach is not static. We are committed to the continuous development of our analytical toolkit, including by incorporating the latest research and advances from other policy institutions. Our 2025 assessment of our monetary policy strategy will provide an opportunity to reassess our current methods and explore new techniques and innovations. This will help us identify gaps or areas for improvement, ensuring that our toolkit remains comprehensive and state-of-the-art, allowing us to confront whatever forms of uncertainty we face in the coming years.
Finally, I want to conclude by differentiating between uncertainty about the macroeconomic cycle versus uncertainty about the economic trend. While I have been primarily focused on cyclical factors today, uncertainty about the trend also matters for monetary policy. In particular, the euro area economy could better withstand cyclical shocks if there were an improvement in the trend growth rate. To this end, the recommendations in the Letta and Draghi reports are of first order importance for the central bank, including a more ambitious agenda for capital markets union.[38]"

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the 34th European Banking Congress: ""Out of the Comfort Zone: Europe and the New World Order""
Frankfurt am Main, 22 November 2024
At last year’s conference, I spoke about Europe’s fragmented capital markets and the urgent need for us to integrate them.
The main thrust of my argument was that Europe was facing transformative changes that came with huge financing needs, and that we would not succeed without mobilising private capital much more effectively.
I called for a “Kantian shift” in how we approach the capital markets union (CMU) project, moving away from bottom-up harmonisation to top-down integration.[1]
But as Martin Luther King said, “we are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today.” And in that time, the urgency to integrate our capital markets has risen.
Since last year, Europe’s declining innovation position has come more clearly to light. The technology gap between the United States and Europe is now unmistakeable.
The geopolitical environment has also become less favourable, with growing threats to free trade from all corners of the world. As the most open of the major economies, the EU is more exposed to these trends than others.
CMU lies at the centre of all these challenges.
It is key for making our economy more dynamic and technologically advanced. While banks play an essential role in the European economy, we know that integrated capital markets are needed for financing early-stage, breakthrough innovation.
And it is key for becoming more resilient in a fragmenting world economy. Capital markets are the missing link for Europeans to turn their high savings into greater wealth – which will ultimately enable them to spend more and strengthen our internal demand.
However, this growing urgency has not been matched by tangible progress towards CMU, in large part because its implementation remains loosely defined.
Since 2015, there have been more than 55 regulatory proposals and 50 non-legislative initiatives, but breadth has come at the expense of depth. It has allowed CMU to be picked apart by national vested interests that see one or another initiative as a threat.
So if we are to achieve a “Kantian shift”, we need to refocus, exposing the core inefficiencies in the system and identifying a smaller number of initiatives with the highest return.
As I see it, the core problem of CMU is that the “pipeline” from savers to innovators is blocked at three key stages:entering,expandingandexiting.
First, European savings are notenteringcapital markets in sufficient volumes because they are concentrated in low-yielding deposits.
Second, when savings do reach capital markets, they remain trapped in national silos and are notexpandingthroughout the European economy.
Third, once savings have been allocated by capital markets, they are notexitingtowards innovative companies and sectors owing to an underdeveloped ecosystem for venture capital.
These three blockages require different solutions, but they must be seen as a single problem, because they are self-reinforcing. Fewer high-growth companies means lower equity valuations and liquidity in EU markets and lower returns for savers.
In my remarks this morning, I will outline the key blockages I see in each area and present some actionable policy proposals that can resolve them.
Entering capital markets
Europeans save a high share of their income: around 13%[2]in 2023 compared with around 8% in the United States.
But typically, Europeans favour low-risk, liquid savings products. In Europe, approximately €11.5 trillion is held in cash and deposits. This is one-third of households’ total financial assets. In the United States, the figure is around only one-tenth.
This has two main consequences for our economy.
First, European households are much less wealthy than they could be. Since 2009, US household wealth has grown by around three times more than that of EU households.[3]
Second, the flow of savings into capital markets is much lower than it could be.
According to ECB analysis, if EU households were to align their deposit-to-financial assets ratio with that of US households, a stock of up to €8 trillion could be redirected into long-term, market-based investments – or a flow of around €350 billion annually.
So why are people not diversifying their assets?
A key issue is that retail investment in Europe is fragmented, opaque and expensive.
In many countries, investing is complex and intermediated by financial advisors that people do not always trust. 45% of consumers say that they are not confident that the advice they receive is primarily in their best interests.[4]
And if households do invest, they often do not get the best deal. Retail investors in European mutual funds, for example, pay almost 60% more in fees than their US counterparts.[5]
Many Europeans therefore end up investing in guaranteed savings accounts by default.
But when markets are more competitive, and consumers can choose from a wide range of suitable investment products, behaviour does change. In the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, households manage their assets in a similar way to their US counterparts, holding only 10-20% of their financial assets in liquid forms.
So, if we are to unblock the “entry stage” of the pipeline, we need savers in Europe to have products that areaccessible,transparentandaffordable. In my view, a “European savings standard” – a standardised, EU-wide set of savings products – is the best way to achieve these goals.
If properly designed and distributed, these products would beaccessible, i.e. simple to understand, available everywhere and offering a range of investment options. They should betransparent, because they would be structured according to clear criteria, such as diversification, fee structure and portfolio composition.
And they should beaffordable, because financial services providers would be able to offer EU-certified products with less red tape, while standardisation would lead to more comparability and competition. Both effects should bring down fees.
The attractiveness of the European standard should also be enhanced by harmonising tax incentives across countries.
The market would decide where savings are directed, not governments. But depending on the preferences of savers, products could also be offered that would support European priorities, such as financing innovation and the green transition.
Expanding throughout Europe
To truly unlock Europe’s innovative potential, we need finance to flow where the best ideas are. And given the nature of digital technology – which often requires large, upfront investments – we need those flows to be in large volumes.
Yet the second stage of the pipeline – expanding throughout Europe – is also blocked.
Capital in Europe is either trapped within national borders or leaves for the United States. If we look at equities, for example, more than 60% of households’ investment in Europe takes place within their own country. Institutional investors invest much more in US markets than they do in the EU.
There are many reasons for this segmentation of European markets, but a key one is that our financial market infrastructures are extraordinarily fragmented.
In 2023 there were 295 trading venues in the EU[6], as well as 14 central counterparties (CCPs) and 32 central securities depositories (CSDs).[7]In the United States, there are only two securities clearing houses and one CSD.
Many CCPs and CSDs belong to pan-European, cross-border groups. But national exchanges remain largely separate, despite some technical synergies like consolidated orderbooks.
This fragmentation creates high transaction costs for cross-border trading, which according to ECB analysis increases home bias in how investors allocate their funds.[8]
That in turn leads to lower liquidity for investors, issuers and stock exchanges. Compared with their EU counterparts, the average daily trading volume per company is 1.3 times higher for US large-caps and two times higher for US mid-caps.[9]
What is driving this fragmentation?
The main issue is that legal frameworks within the EU are divergent and all meaningful attempts at harmonisation are blocked by vested interests.
We have a patchwork of national corporate, tax and securities law, with different requirements for corporate actions, custody services and reporting.[10]
And national authorities tend to exacerbate rather than reduce this problem. For example, some Member States mandate the use of national CSDs for issuing securities under national law, or for settling primary issuances of sovereign bonds.
This mélange of different regimes and enforcing parties severely limits the ability of exchanges and CSDs to integrate their national platforms, even within cross-border groups.
Some progress is being made. Europe is moving towards a common consolidated tape[11], which will help reduce transaction costs. This tape could reduce trading costs by 40-60% by increasing transparency between dealers and investors.[12]
But it will not address the fundamental problem, which is that our incremental approach, focused on harmonising a multitude of national laws, is simply working way too slowly.
If we look at the United States, legal convergence often does not come about through total harmonisation of state-level laws, but rather through federal law being introduced or one state’s law becoming dominant. For example, almost 80% of all US companies that held an initial public offering in 2022 were incorporated in Delaware.[13]
In Europe, we will not be able to make progress by promoting one country’s legal system over another. That is why I called for a “European SEC”[14]in my speech at this event last year, which could be organised as a network of offices in the Member States. But alongside this goal, there are other options we can pursue.
One option would be to adopt a two-tier approach, as we have for competition enforcement or banking supervision. Entities that meet certain criteria would automatically fall under EU jurisdiction but within a common, Europe-wide legal framework.
Another option would be to use “28th regimes”, which would enable us to carve out a special legal framework in areas where progress has stalled. We would then have a separate EU legal regime that firms can opt into sitting alongside the various national regimes.
In my view, the most realistic approach probably involves a combination.
For example, to bypass the cumbersome process of regulatory harmonisation, we could envisage a 28thregime for issuers of securities. They would benefit from a unified corporate and securities law, facilitating cross-border placement, holding and settlement.
Such a regime would be unlikely to work for supervision, however, as it could lead to inconsistent enforcement and misaligned incentives if entities chose their own supervisor. So, here we could envisage a two-tier approach.
Financial services providers that fulfil a set of criteria – such as size or cross-border activity – would fall under European supervision.[15]National authorities would continue to supervise smaller national players. Close collaboration between the European Securities and Markets Authority and national authorities would be essential for success.
Exiting into innovative sectors
Even if we get capital moving more freely within Europe, we still need to ensure that it exits the financial system into innovative sectors and companies. This is the third stage of the pipeline that is blocked in Europe.
In highly innovative economies, there is typically an ecosystem of investors – angel investors, venture capitalists (VCs) – that channels funds to high-growth startups, mostly through providing equity. But this ecosystem is much less developed in Europe than the United States. VC investment is only around one-third of US levels.[16]
The upshot is that innovative young firms struggle to grow in Europe, especially once they reach the scale-up phase, where larger funding rounds are needed. The median European VC-backed company receives around half as much funding as its US counterpart.[17]
And we are largely reliant on foreign VCs to fund European innovation. More than 50% of late-stage investment in European tech comes from outside the EU.[18]
As an open economy, we welcome investment from all parts of the world. But if EU tech entrepreneurs receive mostly outside funding, it can create a path dependency.These founders may ultimately decide to list and grow their businesses elsewhere, especially in the US market – what I would call an “unintended exit”.
So what can we do to close this financing gap?
Fixing the demand side is key. There are too many barriers and bureaucratic hurdles for entrepreneurs in our Single Market, which means there are fewer high-growth companies that VCs want to finance. The recommendations in the Letta and Draghi reports on completing the Single Market are critical for VC to play a greater role.
But we also need to work on the supply side. And since we are starting from a deficit, we need to use all the flexibility we have within the European financial system to unlock funding for innovation. Three changes could make a tangible difference.
First, given the natural alignment of investment horizons, our regulatory regime should allow long-term investors to contribute more to long-term growth.
For example, EU pension funds allocate just 0.02% of total assets to VC, compared with almost 2% for US pension funds. And this percentage is applied to a much larger asset base: over 140% of GDP in the United States compared with around 30% in the EU.[19]
Second, we should fully harness the potential of our public development banks, especially the European Investment Bank (EIB), to pool risks and crowd in private capital.
Successful initiatives are already afoot. Last year, the EIB and six Member States launched the European Tech Champions Initiative, a fund of funds aimed at channelling late-stage growth capital to promising European innovators.
To date, this fund has mobilised €10 billion in public and private resources and supported 16 tech scale-ups. This is significant, considering that in 2023 European scale-ups received around €30 billion in venture capital.
But more can be done to unlock the EIB’s potential and enable us to catch up with our peers faster. In particular, the EIB should be allowed to use its resources more effectively and provide a wider variety of instruments to support breakthrough innovations, especially when it comes to supporting early-stage start-ups.
Third, we should explore how to support innovation not only through equity, but also through debt. While Europe should ultimately aspire to have US levels of VC investment, in the meantime we need to make the most of the bank-based system we have.
Banks can play a role in financing innovation. One interesting development in Europe over the past decade has been the rise of venture debt – loans that provide liquidity to start-ups between equity funding rounds. In 2022 around €24 billion in venture debt was allocated, up from around €1 billion in 2014.[20]
But if banks are to lend more to riskier sectors without compromising on prudential regulation, they need the balance sheet space to do so. Developing securitisation in Europe could support this.
EU banks currently lend more than €600 billion to real estate companies but less than €100 billion to technology companies – even though the contribution of each sector to real value added is around the same.[21]Tools that could facilitate some rebalancing of these exposures could support innovative activity in Europe.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Leonardo da Vinci is supposed to have said that, “Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do”.
Today, European leaders know the problems created by capital market fragmentation and are willing to act. But so far, we have neither been applying nor doing.
Lack of progress comes down, in large part, to the loose definition of CMU and the piecemeal legislative approach this creates. That in turn allows the project to suffer “death by a thousand cuts” as vested interests oppose or dilute each piece of legislation.
Today, I have laid out a framework to refocus our efforts, with the aim of providing the precision and direction we need to break the deadlock.
This is the “Kantian shift” I talked about last year: a change of perspective from taking a large number of small steps to a small number of large steps – and choosing those that we can actually take and that will make the biggest difference."

Speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the University of Cyprus, Nicosia
Nicosia, 21 November 2024
When the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, spoke at the Central Bank of Cyprus in March 2022, she emphasised the importance of finding resilience in times of uncertainty.[1]And indeed, at that point in time the resilience of the European economy was being tested to the limit. We were just coming out of a global pandemic and adjusting to Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine, which had triggered an energy crisis in Europe. The combination of these two factors resulted in a surge in inflation.[2]The annual increase in the general price level of goods and services in the euro area peaked at 10.6% in October 2022, and Cyprus had already reached this peak in July. This was far above the ECB Governing Council’s 2% target for inflation over the medium term, which we see as best maintaining our primary objective of price stability. To counter the increase in inflation, in July 2022 we began increasing our key interest rates at an unprecedented pace, and by September 2023 they had risen by 450 basis points in total, with the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – reaching 4%.
Since then, the incoming information has shown that the disinflationary process is well on track. This has allowed us to steadily reduce our rates by 75 basis points since June this year, with the deposit facility rate now sitting at 3.25%. Throughout this adjustment to interest rates, which are still higher than they were before the pandemic, the European economy, including the financial system, has demonstrated its resilience, which is built on the reforms that have been implemented since the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis.
But despite this positive progress, I feel it is very important to warn of the dangers of complacency. Because the economy has by no means escaped the treacherous waters of recent years. If anything, we are venturing deeper into uncharted territory. In addition to the risks to the outlook for economic activity being tilted to the downside, structural trends are developing that will provide significant challenges to the global and European economies in the years to come. Geopolitical tensions are not expected to subside, with Russia’s war in Ukraine still ongoing and the escalating conflict in the Middle East showing no sign of abating. We are seeing economic fragmentation along geopolitical fault lines, and protectionist tendencies are growing. And all the while, the climate and nature crises are worsening, with disasters becoming ever more frequent and severe.
Today I will outline how these trends are particularly notable for the bottlenecks that they may impose on the economy, while of course acknowledging that the word bottleneck fails to do justice to the human suffering and damage caused by geopolitical conflict, global heating and nature degradation. For the purposes of this speech, by bottlenecks I mean interruptions and damage to the productive capacity of the economy. I will argue that we need to future-proof our economy against geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and climate and nature hazards to ensure it is resilient in the face of more frequent bottlenecks. For monetary policy, this implies that we must remain laser-focused on our price stability objective, while maintaining flexibility to account for bottlenecks as they emerge.
From trends to day-to-day reality
As monetary policymakers we typically focus on our objective of maintaining price stability when we talk about the threats major trends pose to the economy. This may give the impression that the threats we see are quite far removed from people’s day-to-day lives. However, nothing could be further from the truth. There are abundant examples of how these threats are already having very tangible effects on people’s daily lives.
Just as an example, think about your morning cup of coffee at a local cafe before you start your day – with apologies to those of you who don’t drink coffee. The queue has probably grown longer since the pandemic because of staff shortages – workers were let go during the pandemic and have not always been replaced in sufficient numbers. These staff shortages have also enabled the baristas who make your coffee to demand higher wages, which are probably then reflected in the price you pay. And this price has almost certainly further increased because the price of coffee beans has increased substantially compared with a year ago. This is largely due to adverse weather conditions linked to global warming, which are increasingly affecting coffee crop yields around the world. And in Europe in particular, the price may have increased still further because of disruptions to the supply of coffee beans. Shipping vessels are steering clear of the Red Sea to avoid militant attacks and are taking the longer route around South Africa instead.
Labour scarcity, global warming and geopolitical tensions, all pressed into the price of your morning espresso – or freddo espresso, as I understand is very popular in Cyprus.
Clearly, at the ECB it is not our statutory responsibility to maintain stable prices of individual products such as your morning coffee. But we are responsible for maintaining overall price stability in the euro area. This means that we are responsible for anchoring the change in the overall level of consumer prices over the medium term, and the price of coffee is a very small part of that. The broader trends that are affecting the price of your cup of coffee are also threats to our price stability objective. These threats will cause bottlenecks that will test the resilience of the economy even more rigorously than before. So we are paying very close attention to them as they represent risk factors for medium-term inflation in the euro area.
But while the reasons for labour scarcity being a bottleneck are fairly self-evident, the picture is more complicated when it comes to geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and the ongoing climate and nature crises. So I will now discuss these threats in more detail, while also being mindful that the associated bottlenecks are just one of the effects that we have to consider when assessing their monetary policy implications.
The consequences of a bottleneck economy
Let me start by discussing the bottlenecks that result from geopolitical tensions and economic fragmentation.
With the Kyrenia – a trading vessel dating back to the fourth century BC – featuring on its 10, 20 and 50 cent coins, Cyprus doesn’t need reminding of the importance of international trade for economic welfare. However, in recent years we have seen globalisation reach a plateau and, notably, more frequent interruptions to global value chains in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. Protectionist measures are still looming on the horizon, so the risk of increased bottlenecks in global value chains also remains. Some geopolitical risks may escalate abruptly, requiring equally abrupt adjustments in the economy which would cause further production bottlenecks. We already experienced this during the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when Europe quickly needed to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. China being a top provider of foreign critical inputs for industries in the EU – like the nickel used in car batteries and the silicon used in solar panels – might cause similar bottlenecks if the supply of those inputs suddenly dries up.[3]
Global heating and nature degradation are also eroding the productive capacity of the economy. Nature degradation depletes the services that ecosystems provide, such as food, drinking water and raw materials, as well as protection against natural hazards and carbon uptake and storage. In addition to this depletion of non-renewable resources, natural inputs to the economy that do regenerate are increasingly being degraded. Scientists have calculated that humanity is currently using natural resources 1.7 times faster than ecosystems can regenerate them – in other words, each year we are consuming resources equivalent to 1.7 planet Earths.[4]
And the impact of the climate and nature crises reaches far beyond the inputs that nature provides to the economy. For example, the average lifespan of the physical capital stock – including manufacturing plants, roads, ports, electricity grids, office buildings and people’s homes – will shorten significantly due to increasing natural hazards. This implies that, without an increase in investment, the available capital stock will decline, negatively affecting the productive capacity of the economy.
In addition to climate and nature hazards reducing the stock of natural and physical capital, the economic yield of this capital is also adversely affected. To take just one example, crop yields have fallen because of more frequent extreme weather events. Estimates from ECB staff suggest that the heatwave in 2022 increased overall food price inflation by around 0.6 to 0.7 percentage points, with the impact lasting well into 2023.[5]At these magnitudes, this becomes a risk factor for overall price stability, especially because extreme weather events are becoming both more frequent and longer lasting. This is why, in our recent monetary policy communication, we explicitly acknowledge adverse weather conditions as risk factors for the inflation outlook.[6]Other sectors are similarly suffering from the impact of global warming and nature degradation. Think of the bottlenecks to trade and industrial production when inland shipping routes become unnavigable as rivers increasingly run dry. Companies may attempt to recoup the resulting losses by increasing their prices, but they may also simply see their financial resilience deteriorate.
Future-proofing the economy against bottlenecks
In the absence of mitigating factors, bottlenecks caused by geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and climate and nature hazards erode the productive capacity of the economy. The most straightforward and effective option to avoid these bottlenecks would be to reject protectionist tendencies and implement a timely and successful transition to a sustainable green economy. Earlier today, Claudia Buch, the Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board, delivered a speech forcefully reiterating the call for this green transition while also emphasising its economic benefits.[7]
Unfortunately, we cannot take for granted that the best option will materialise. Central banks cannot influence the geopolitical tides. Despite the efforts of governments, climate and nature science tells us that climate and nature objectives will not be met in time, and hazards are already on the rise.[8]So, in addition to striving unrelentingly to accomplish this best option, we also need to identify ways of future-proofing the economy to increase its resilience in the face of bottlenecks that are likely to emerge. As President Lagarde made clear in a speech earlier this week, adaptation and anticipation will be crucial in this challenging environment.[9]
In fact, an adjustment to geopolitical risks is already taking place. While the euro area has been progressively diversifying import sources since the turn of the century – even though this means turning to a larger number of sourcing countries and increasing trade costs – our analysis finds that since 2016 this diversification increasingly has a geopolitical dimension.[10]And incoming data show that foreign direct investment made by companies to build new production capacity abroad, or extend existing capacity, is also showing signs of fragmentation along geopolitical lines.[11]
More investments are needed for upgrading, adapting and replenishing the existing physical capital stock to future-proof it against increasing climate and nature hazards. Increasing capital stock resilience may also require physically relocating parts of it to avoid proximity to areas that will be heavily exposed to hazards.
The adverse impact of evolving threats to the economy’s productive capacity can also be reduced by countering labour scarcity and increasing productivity. In a recent speech, ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel argued that there is scope for addressing labour scarcity by further increasing labour participation, allocating workers more efficiently, strengthening education and attracting foreign workers.[12]ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos recently highlighted enhancement of the Single Market and advancement towards capital markets union in Europe as a means of bridging the productivity gap that has emerged between the euro area and the United States over the past 30 years.[13]And reports by Mario Draghi on European competitiveness[14]and Enrico Letta on the Single Market[15]provide a set of policy proposals that require serious consideration in this context. Technological advances – in particular, rapid developments in artificial intelligence[16]– also present an opportunity for Europe to increase productivity. At the same time, an increased reliance on technologies opens up new vulnerabilities in the form of cyber risks that are likely to be aggravated by geopolitical and climate and nature threats. Additionally, cyber incidents may very well create similar bottlenecks to those stemming from geopolitical tensions and climate and nature hazards, which only increases the importance of improving overall economic resilience.[17]
Implications for monetary policy
Let me turn to the implications of increased bottlenecks for the ECB and our monetary policy.
We are responsible for maintaining price stability. We have neither the competencies nor the instruments to stop bottlenecks emerging that affect the productive capacity of the economy. We also cannot avoid the adjustments that the economy will have to undergo in response to emerging bottlenecks. These typically take the form of relative price adjustments and sectoral adjustments in economic activity, which may translate into consequences for aggregate economic activity, unemployment and inflation. The ability of the economy to adapt – supported by fiscal policy whenever necessary – is in fact a crucial component of the economy’s overall resilience.
Our task is to prevent situations where welcome adjustments to bottlenecks translate into very unwelcome risks to medium-term price stability – such situations can arise when adjustments go beyond relative price alterations and temporary deviations of inflation from our 2% target. When inflation expectations are firmly anchored at our target, workers and companies take this into account when negotiating wages and setting prices, which helps avoid spiralling wage and price dynamics aggravating the impact of shocks. So, the more frequent and more pronounced the adjustments facing the economy, the more important it becomes that the economy can rely on its price stability anchor.
At the same time, assessing the appropriate monetary policy response becomes more complicated. While we cannot avoid the occurrence of bottlenecks, we must be able to identify them and assess the implications for price stability. Besides accounting for the implications of geopolitical risks, fragmentation and climate and nature hazards for the productive capacity of the economy, we must also assess these effects in conjunction with changes to demand that are likely to occur at the same time. And, as bottlenecks may have an impact on the financial resilience of firms, there may also be financial transmission channels which must not be overlooked. If financial risks arising from bottlenecks were to impair the soundness of financial institutions – despite all our efforts as a banking supervisor to mitigate them – the effectiveness of our monetary policy could also be adversely affected. We cannot pre-empt exactly what the appropriate policy response to an emerging bottleneck would be. Therefore, the flexibility and data-dependency that we have applied in navigating the challenges of the past few years will remain crucial in the years to come.
Finally – all else being equal – monetary policy may have to respond more proactively to bottlenecks than has been considered appropriate in the past. Traditionally, central banks have often looked through temporary shocks affecting the productive capacity of the economy and not necessarily responded with policy adjustments.[18]Monetary policy works its way through the economy with long and variable lags. If a shock is short-lived and inflation expectations are firmly anchored, the inflation impact may have already faded by the time a monetary policy response has been transmitted to the economy. By not responding to such temporary shocks, central banks aim to avoid policy adversely affecting economic activity while inflation is still consistent with their medium-term target.
However, considering the magnitude, frequency and persistence of the bottlenecks that might emerge, their impact on inflation may also be more pronounced and long-lasting. This could increase the risks of inflation expectations becoming de-anchored and of second-round effects in the form of wage-price spirals, which would be inconsistent with our price stability objective. Therefore – again, all else being equal – the prevalence of geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and climate and nature hazards implies that there would be less scope for looking through deviations of inflation from our 2% target. In other words, in the future, monetary policy may have to respond more proactively to bottlenecks that affect the productive capacity of the economy, which heightens the importance of maintaining flexibility.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In the current environment of geopolitical tensions and economic fragmentation, and in view of the ongoing climate and nature crises, there is an increasing likelihood of bottlenecks emerging that will test the resilience of the economy. This not only complicates the pursuit of price stability, it also threatens the safety and soundness of banks – which is why it is also reflected in our priorities for European banking supervision.
More favourable winds would reduce bottlenecks and make the pursuit of our mandate easier. However, we are unconditionally committed to delivering on our mandate, and this is not changed by the way the wind blows. Sailor Pavlos Kontides, Cyprus’ first Olympic medal winner, said in an interview just before winning silver at the Paris Olympics this summer: “If I make the right choices, I don’t care if it’s a light or a strong breeze.” In our case, to make the right policy choices we must stay laser-focused on our objective of price stability, while maintaining flexibility to account for bottlenecks as they emerge.
My final message is addressed directly to the students, teachers and researchers gathered here today. The silver lining to the challenges that I have outlined is that your talents, knowledge and expertise are urgently needed. Roman philosopher – and follower of Zeno of Citium[19]– Seneca the Younger is known to have said that, while labour strengthens the body, difficulties strengthen the mind. Insecure times call for the strongest minds to secure stability and resilience.
Thank you for your attention."

Introductory remarks by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the tenth meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures
Frankfurt am Main, 21 November 2024
As any good sports coach will tell you, you need to deploy different defensive tactics against different teams. As an example, let me talk about a couple of different opponents you may face in the world of football.
You may have to play a team that uses the high-press approach – or gegenpressing – as popularised by Jürgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund. This team aggressively chases after your defenders, hoping to force a mistake and win the ball off you as quickly as possible. Or you could play against a more counter-attacking team such as José Mourinho’s Inter Milan. They will patiently sit back and let you play and, when the moment is right, use their quick forwards to surprise you with a break-away goal.
I will argue that what we face today in the world of cyber security is similar to the challenges faced by football managers as they prepare their defence for the season to come. In both cases, the different tactics of the opposing teams’ attack will require different defensive strategies.
Facing cyber threats in a new geopolitical and technological environment
So, with this analogy in mind, let me start by outlining what threats we are facing in the current geopolitical environment. I will focus on two key trends: geopolitics and technology.
It is a long-held truism that geopolitical tension drives cyber activity. As competing nation states seek to advance their interests and disrupt their adversaries, more intense cyberattacks take place. But this is not just a truism, it is also backed up by hard data – and these data reveal that we are not moving in the right direction.
At the aggregate level, recent empirical analysis by the IMF[1]confirms that countries facing heightened geopolitical tensions have a relatively greater likelihood of experiencing a cyberattack. And here in Europe our exposure to such tensions has increased significantly. For evidence of this, look no further than the geopolitical risk index of the euro area, which is now at a historically very heightened level[2], as my colleague Claudia Buch recently highlighted.[3]
This picture is also reflected in recent European cyber threat assessment reports, which provide evidence on the activities of new state-related threat actors.
For example, the latest ENISA Threat Landscape report[4]highlights a significant increase in the number of cyber events that have occurred in the EU over the past year, with the financial sector being the third-most targeted segment. The report attributes the increase in large part to the various geopolitical tensions that the EU is currently facing.
Multiple analyses – including from French[5]and US authorities – provide details on the increasing number of observed attacks whose aim seems to be espionage. These are often undertaken by state-backed actors and are becoming more sophisticated in their use of stealthy techniques.[6]
The second key driver of the threat landscape relates to technology. Various technological changes are ongoing, and each tends to expose more potential targets to cyber attackers.
The number of online devices we use is growing and so is the amount of time we are spending on them. In addition, as I emphasised in my remarks at the last ECRB meeting[7], infrastructure operators are increasing their reliance on outsourcing and other types of third-party service provision. Together, these trends multiply the number of potential cyberattack targets and increase the amount of time per day that those targets are available.
So, we face an apparent proliferation of sophisticated and deep-pocketed state-sponsored threat actors launching complex cyberattacks. And at the same time, there are more and more potential targets available to them.
It is therefore difficult to escape the conclusion that the overall threat outlook is deteriorating. In other words, our team will have its work cut out to defend our goal this season.
Policy and oversight in support of strong cyber defence
Thankfully, infrastructure operators do not have to face these challenges alone. Let me share my thoughts on how policy and oversight can support operators in firming up their defences.
The recently updated Eurosystem cyber resilience strategy sets out the three pillars of this support: entity readiness, sector resilience and regulator-industry engagement.[8]
Overseers work with entities to enhance their individual cyber readiness and assess their cyber maturity in an objective way using the Eurosystem’s cyber resilience oversight expectations and the TIBER-EU framework for red-team testing. We will continue to strengthen these efforts to firm up entity readiness over time.
Given the highly interconnected nature of financial market infrastructures, sound risk management requires a strong emphasis on sector-wide resilience. Overseers have various tools to assess cyber risk and supply-chain risk at the sectoral level. This includes the Eurosystem’s critical service provider survey, which is based on a self-assessment by the entities. This enables overseers to accurately map the sector, identifying the critical nodes and interdependencies within the European financial ecosystem.
To come back to my footballing analogy, if someone on the European financial infrastructures team concedes a goal in the cyber “game”, we are all in danger of losing. It is therefore important to test the match fitness of our defences from a collective perspective. In this context, the updated cyber strategy introduces industry-wide scenario-based testing exercises to assess sectoral preparedness. Exercises will simulate an extreme but plausible cyberattack to test how prepared the sector is to respond to attacks, including in terms of the time needed to resume services.
Most relevant for today’s event, the ECRB helps to stimulate a healthy level of strategic engagement between regulators and the industry. In an environment where the attackers we face and the techniques they use are quickly shifting, this forum provides leaders with a valuable opportunity to exchange ideas on how best to tackle emerging challenges.
This dialogue is vital to address our shared challenges. I look forward to making further progress together in key areas, such as sustainably building up the labour force in cyber security.
Like in football, the market for talent is highly competitive. According to a recent IMF report[9], there is a global shortage of approximately four million cybersecurity professionals. In this context, it feels like we are all chasing the same scarce talent to boost our cyber defences.
But unlike competing football clubs, our incentives are more aligned. There is greater scope for collaborative solutions to nurture cyber talent, and I would welcome creative ideas on how to achieve this.
Investing in cyber security at entity level to support long-term success
Notwithstanding this collective dimension to cyber security, let me also emphasise that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring an institution’s cyber resilience lies with the institution itself.
Unfortunately, in today’s geopolitical and technological environment the overall cyber threat level is steadily increasing. Entities face a growing number of deep-pocketed state cyber actors and must protect an attack surface that is broadening due to technological trends.
In this context, entities may find that maintaining robust cyber defences will require even more time and effort. Committing more resources to defence may create tensions within organisations, as this may divert them from other endeavours. However, in the end, achieving high cyber resilience is a core part of the product offering of financial market infrastructures. So investing sufficiently to achieve a high level of cyber resilience is necessary for long-term success.
In addition, the geopolitical environment is tilting the threat landscape further towards state actors. For some time now, these players have been responsible for the most serious cyber threats, and this is likely to continue.
Our defensive tactics must consider this reality. Rather than preparing for traditional criminally motivated cyberattacks seeking ransoms, we must be nimble in devising ways to detect attackers that take a more patient, underhand and counter-attacking approach.
Conclusion
To conclude, let me say that the challenges we face in organising our cyber defences are clearly greater than those faced in the world of football.
After all, football managers only need to organise their defence to face one team at a time, and once the 90 minutes are over, there is time to rest and recover. By contrast, in the cyber environment we need to defend against all cyber actors at the same time, all day every day. In other words, our defence must play against the attackers of all our opponents at the same time – and the referee will never blow for full-time.
But we do have some things on our side. Unlike in football management, we have much more scope to collaborate. This allows us to strengthen our defences both at the individual and the collective level. So, with that in mind, I look forward to open discussions today and to sharing knowledge and ideas on how we can further boost our defensive capabilities.
Thank you."

Speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the tenth Green Finance Forum “Innovate in Nature”
Frankfurt am Main, 19 November 2024
Thank you for inviting me to speak at the opening of the tenth Green Finance Forum. I fully subscribe to the theme of today’s forum, given how vitally important it is to “innovate in nature”. Especially because in many ways nature is still not accounted for in policies, regulation and risk management, but it should be, considering its vital importance for the economy – including the financial system. This morning I will outline how the relevance of nature is being confirmed by incoming research and how the European Central Bank (ECB) is acting on this to deliver on its mandate of maintaining price stability and preserving the safety and soundness of banks.
A thriving natural environment provides many benefits that sustain human well-being and the global economy. Think of fertile soils, pollination, timber, fishing stocks, clean water and clean air. Unfortunately, intensive land use, climate change, pollution, overexploitation and other human pressures are rapidly and seriously damaging our natural resources. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services already sounded the alarm back in 2019, shortly before the outbreak of the pandemic.[1]The degradation of nature is primarily caused by human activity and is being made worse by global heating. In addition to the depletion of non-renewable resources, natural inputs to the economy that are renewable are also increasingly being degraded.Scientists have calculated that humanity is using natural resources 1.7 times faster than ecosystems can regenerate them – in other words, we are consuming resources equivalent to 1.7 planet Earths.
This nature loss poses a serious risk to humanity as it threatens vital areas, such as the supply of food and medicine. Such threats are also existential for the economy and the financial system, as our economy cannot exist without nature.[2]One of the papers presented at the annual ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal, in July of this year shows how biodiversity loss can cause losses to economic output while at the same time decreasing the resilience of that output to future biodiversity losses.[3]However, in practice, at least thus far, the contribution of the inputs nature provides to the economy is rarely measured directly in statistics like GDP.
Central banks and supervisors like the ECB need to gain a better understanding of just how vulnerable the economy and the financial system are to nature degradation. We need to incorporate nature into the analysis of the drivers of economic development and the assessment of future productive capacity.[4]Degradation of nature can impair production processes and consequently weaken the creditworthiness of many companies, which might in turn impair loans extended by banks.
How nature affects the economy
As is the case with climate change, nature affects companies and banks via two main channels: physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks may be acute risks, such as increasingly severe natural disasters, or chronic risks, such as dwindling ecosystems. The effects could include falling crop yields owing to a decline in pollinating insects or the degradation of agricultural land. The scarcity of natural products could lead to supply-side shocks for the pharmaceutical industry or make some tourist destinations less attractive.
Nature loss can also amplify the transition risks of banks and their borrowers. Governments are stepping up their efforts to protect the environment: the UN Convention on Biological Diversity set global targets in 2022, including the conservation by 2030 of at least 30% of the world’s lands, inland waters, coastal areas and oceans.[5]Such government measures could lead to changes in regulation and policy, limiting the exploitation of natural resources or banning certain environmentally harmful products. Technological innovation, new business models and changes in consumer or investor sentiment could also lead to transition risks and transition costs as companies are forced to adapt. Some established business models could disappear, while others might become too expensive and lose market share.
At the ECB, we looked at the dependence on nature of more than 4.2 million individual companies accounting for over €4.2 trillion in corporate loans.[6]We assessed how dependent companies and banks in the euro area are on the various benefits that humanity obtains from nature – experts call this concept “ecosystem services”. Examples of the services that ecosystems provide are products suchas food, drinking water, timber and minerals; protection against natural hazards; and carbon uptake and storage by vegetation.
To assess the associated physical risk, we assessed the extent to which companies financed by euro area banks are dependent on ecosystem services. The principal assumption behind this assessment is that greater dependence on ecosystem services is likely to result in greater exposure to ecosystem degradation. If nature degradation continues, economic activities dependent on ecosystem services will be affected by issues such as supply chain disruptions, which have an impact on prices and ultimately on inflation. Moreover, reduced turnover could result in defaults and, as a consequence, losses for the banks that lend to these companies. This could ultimately lead to financial stability concerns.
Our analysis shows that euro area companies are significantly exposed to several ecosystem services, both directly and via their supply chains. The most important services are mass stabilisation and erosion control, surface and ground water supply, flood and storm protection, and carbon uptake and storage. Indirect dependency via supply chains is particularly significant for sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing and wholesale, and the retail trade.
Our assessment shows that in the euro area, around three million individual companies are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service. Severe losses of functionality in the relevant ecosystem would translate into critical economic problems for those companies. We also found that almost 75% of bank loans to companies in the euro area are granted to companies that are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service. We observed only moderate differences between countries, as indirect supply chain dependencies offset smaller direct dependencies, especially in small and open economies.
Accounting for nature in central banking and supervision
The results of our research confirm that the European economy is highly dependent on ecosystem services and that these risks can spread to the financial system, potentially triggering instability. If nature degradation continues at its current pace, companies will be affected and banks’ credit portfolios will deteriorate. This is why we expect banks under our supervision to manage all material nature-related risks, consistent with the supervisory guide that we published in 2020 with expectations about banks’ risk management practices for both climate-related and environmental risks.[7]It is also the reason the ECB has made nature one of the focus areas of its climate and nature plan for 2024 and 2025.
Our ongoing work confirms the profound impact of nature degradation on the economy, including the financial system and price stability, which mirrors that of climate change. Nature degradation and climate change are therefore both relevant to our mandate and our monetary policy strategy. From my point of view, the ECB’s upcoming assessment of the monetary policy strategy provides an opportunity to confirm the relevance of nature degradation and climate change for monetary policy in the euro area.
An integrated approach to climate and nature is critical, because they are interconnected and amplify the effects of physical and transition risks. Given the high level of uncertainty regarding impacts, non-linearities, tipping points and irreversibility, gauging nature-related risks is complex. We cannot do this alone. Scientific input is needed to learn more about the transmission channels to our economies.
Work is progressing at the international level. The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – a network of 141 central banks and supervisors from around the world – had already acknowledged the relevance of nature-related risks to the mandates of these institutions back in March 2022.[8]The NGFS has since developed a conceptual framework offering central banks and supervisors a common understanding of nature-related financial risks and a principle-based risk assessment approach.[9]Moreover, in July this year the NGFS published a report on nature-related litigation to raise awareness among financial institutions, central banks and supervisors.[10]The report highlighted that while nature-related litigation is still in its infancy, the number of cases is expected to grow rapidly. This trend underlines the real risk of doing too little: for governments, companies, banks, central banks and supervisors.
Policymakers, regulators and supervisors are in fact taking action. The Financial Stability Board recently took stock of supervisory and regulatory initiatives among its members and established that a growing number of financial authorities are considering the potential implications nature-related risks have for the financial sector.[11]This work must continue. International fora must ensure that nature-related considerations are fully integrated into regulation and supervision, alongside ongoing efforts to account for climate-related considerations. This starts with identifying exposures and vulnerabilities to nature-related risks. This does not mean that economists should start counting ants in Aragon, butterflies in Bavaria or worms in Wallonia. Instead, economists must develop the means to transpose insights from environmental science into variables of economic interest like growth, inflation and financial risks.
Since our economy relies on nature, destroying nature means destroying the economy. Preventing the destruction of nature is the responsibility of elected governments, as they are the ones who make environmental policies. For their part, central banks and supervisors have to take nature-related risks into account in the pursuit of their mandates, just as they do with any other factors that are vitally important to price stability and the safety and soundness of banks. Naturally, at the ECB we are committed to doing exactly that. Naturally, within our mandate. Naturally, because of our mandate."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at ""Les Essentiels des Bernardins"", Paris
Paris, 18 November 2024
It is both an honour and a privilege to address you at the esteemed Collège des Bernardins, a site rich in history and intellectual tradition.
As I stand in this restored medieval college, I am reminded of the profound role that monastic institutions have played in spreading Christian values throughout Europe.
In these environments, ideals of social responsibility flourished through communal living. The principle of “ora et labora” (pray and work) underlined the dignity of labour. And the study of theology and major disciplines of human knowledge contributed to Western thought.
These moral foundations contributed to the emergence of the Church’s social doctrine in the 19th century and the creation of the welfare state.
The welfare state developed in response to rising inequality, hazardous working conditions and urban poverty triggered by the Industrial Revolution. Yet it was the wealth created by this very same Revolution and these new technologies that provided governments with the spending capacity to help the less fortunate.
As tax revenues rose, it became possible to provide people with more social insurance, healthcare and education. To echo the words of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck – creator of the world’s first welfare state in the 1880s – welfare spending became an expression of “practical Christianity”.[1]
As the years have gone by, Europe has stayed true to this model, combining technological progress with social protection. However, as I outlined in my Camdessus lecture last September, our European way is now under pressure from significant shifts that are taking place.[2]
First, we are living through a period of rapid technological change, driven in particular by advances in digital innovation. And unlike in the past, Europe is no longer at the forefront of progress. Our productivity growth – the key factor driving our long-term prosperity – is diverging from the United States.
Second, we are witnessing a shifting geopolitical landscape, one that is fragmenting into rival blocs, where attitudes towards free trade are being called into question and approaches to regulating the technology sector are diverging among advanced economies.
In this changing landscape, Europe is under growing pressure to redefine its position in order to remain competitive.
In this setting, two principles are critical:adaptationandanticipation.
We must adapt to the changing world around us and make up the ground we have lost in terms of productivity and technology. Otherwise, we will not be able to generate the wealth we will need to meet our rising spending needs to ensure our security, combat climate change and protect the environment.
But we must also anticipate the disruptions that technological and geopolitical shifts will bring – and prepare for them by renewing our social model.
Adaptation
At the heart of the European model lies a unique commitment to equity and cohesion.
European economies – more than other advanced economies – strive to ensure that economic growth enhances social wellbeing. The level of public social spending in many European economies exceeds the average of other advanced economies.[3]And this resonates strongly with Europeans. Today, almost nine out of ten citizens consider a social Europe to be important.[4]
Over time, labour market reforms have encouraged people to develop specialised skills.[5]Our highly educated workforce has historically played a key role in driving innovation in Europe, allowing it to gain a competitive edge in high value-added sectors ranging from machinery to luxury goods.
Today, however, two megatrends are challenging our economic model.
First, we are facing a new geopolitical landscape, in which key economic dependencies are turning into geopolitical vulnerabilities. Europe’s economy, more open than others and characterised by a trade-to-GDP ratio exceeding 50%, is now facing pressure in an increasingly inward-looking global environment.
Compared with the United States, Europe is facing much stronger competition from China in its traditional areas of strength.
ECB analysis finds that the share of sectors in which China directly competes with euro area exporters has increased significantly from about one-quarter in 2002 to nearly two-fifths today.[6]At the same time, the EU’s share in world trade is declining, with a notable fall since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.[7]
Furthermore, the shifting geopolitical landscape is leading western economies to rethink their attitude towards free trade and adopt divergent approaches to the regulation of competition, technology and digital technologies. These changes will have a varying impact on individual countries’ industrial competitiveness at the global level and will weigh on Europe’s economic growth model.
This brings me to the second trend: Europe is falling behind in emerging technologies that will drive future growth.
While the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on growth is still uncertain, estimates suggest it could be transformative.[8]But the EU is caught in what has been called a “middle technology trap”. We are specialised in technologies that were mostly developed in the last century. Only four of the world’s top 50 tech companies are European.
One key reason we are lagging behind is because our innovation and financing ecosystems are not suited to developing new advanced technologies.
This is not because we lack talented people and ideas, or because we lack the savings to invest in those ideas. The difficulty stems from a lack of scale in our digital single market and from a lack of capital markets to channel savings to entrepreneurs.
In fact, more than one-third of EU savings sit in cash and low-yielding bank deposits,[9]compared with around one-tenth in the United States. As a result, a majority of tech investment in Europe comes from US venture capitalists, while only a small minority originates from EU-based investors.[10]
The upshot of all this is that our productivity growth in Europe is progressively slowing, which means that our ability to generate income is diminishing. If left unchecked, we will face a future of lower tax revenues and higher debt ratios, which will have serious implications for our financing capacity.
We face a rising old-age dependency ratio which will drive up public spending on pensions.[11]And it is estimated that governments will need to spend in excess of €1 trillion a year to meet our investment needs for climate change, innovation and defence.[12]
If we cannot raise productivity, we risk having fewer resources for social spending. We also risk not having the means to deliver on our other European ambitions. These include enhancing our security by modernising our defence capabilities as well as successfully navigating the green transition to combat climate change.
So, we have to adapt – and we can adapt. All the ingredients are there. Collectively, the EU is a large, rich economy. But we are not acting collectively. Simply unlocking our single market for goods and capital could lead to huge gains. The trade barriers that still exist within the EU represent a shortfall of around 10% of our economic potential.[13]
According to the IMF, internal barriers within Europe are equivalent to a 44% tariff for manufacturing and 110% for services.[14]Imagine the possibilities for innovative companies to grow in Europe if they did not have to contend with those costs.
Moreover, if we were to give EU households better opportunities to invest their savings, up to €8 trillion could be redirected into long-term investments. We would have ample funding to develop innovations and develop and transform the technologies of the future.
Anticipation
All this is well known. To be ready, we need to anticipate the changes that are coming now.
First, we must anticipate the impact of technology on people.
This will largely depend on the values that underpin the design of digital technologies and the intentions of the people who use it.
For example, in the case of a broad and unchecked expansion of AI, ECB staff estimate that around one-quarter of jobs in European countries are highly exposed to AI-enabled automation, while a further one-third are moderately exposed.[15]
But unlike previous waves of computerisation, AI is capable of performing complex cognitive tasks such as analysis, decision making and even creative work. As a result, its effects are likely to be more widespread, impacting low and highly-skilled workers alike.
People will be expected to perform new tasks in their current jobs, or move to new jobs as old tasks will become obsolete more quickly. There will be a much greater emphasis on adult learning than we see today to ensure that workers can keep up with technological change.
And there will likely be some social consequences during the transition: the workers who are the quickest to adjust will see outsized gains, which could exacerbate inequality.
So our aim in adapting to digital technology should not solely be to do things faster or more efficiently at the expense of inclusion. Instead, we must prioritise development that serves the common good, not necessarily by expanding social protection but by enhancing individual empowerment and capabilities.
We can do so through a renewed, EU-wide focus on skills. Inclusion depends on everyone having the skills they need to benefit from digitalisation.
Research shows that when workers are given the right skills, the benefits of AI can be more widespread. Less experienced or low-skilled workers can increase their productivity by 35% when using AI, more so even than highly skilled workers.[16]
But currently, a significant portion of Europeans lack basic digital skills.[17]And neither the public nor the private sector is filling the gap.
Participation in adult education and training is relatively low overall. Only around one-third of adults participated in training in 2016 and this rate has barely increased since then. And almost 60% of workers say that the formal digital training offered by their employers is not enough.[18]
So, we will need an overhaul of education, training and adult learning, with the public and private sectors working together to identify skills gaps and find solutions.
The second is anticipating the implications of geopolitical shifts on the way Europe works together.
We can no longer see ourselves as a loose club of independent economies. That perspective is outdated in a world that is fragmenting into geopolitical blocs centred around the largest economies. Today we need to see ourselves as a single, large economy with predominantly shared interests.
This paradigm shift also calls for joining forces in more areas.
We face and will continue to face growing expenditure arising from a changing security environment, ageing populations and the climate transition – challenges that we will only be able to meet together. And if we do not, we will face some difficult choices between adjusting our social model, delivering on our climate ambitions and playing a leading role in global affairs.
By acting as a union to raise our productivity growth, and by pooling our resources in areas where we have a tight convergence of priorities – like defence and the green transition – we can both deliver the outcomes we want and be efficient in our management of public spending.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Since the dawn of the industrial age, Europe has prided itself on a unique economic model – one that balances technological progress with comprehensive social welfare.
Today, however, Europe is under pressure. The rapid pace of technological change triggered by the digital revolution has left us trailing behind. We need to adapt quickly to a changing geopolitical environment and regain lost ground in competitiveness and innovation. Failure to do so could jeopardise our ability to generate the wealth needed to sustain our economic and social model, which the vast majority of Europeans nevertheless hold dear.
Let me finish with a quote from Marcus Aurelius: “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”"

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the SUERF Marjolin Lecture hosted by the Banca d’Italia
Rome, 18 November 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to explain how macroeconomic models can help in understanding the extraordinary 2021-2022 inflation surges and the monetary policy response, in the context of the euro area.[1]By and large, the scale and persistence of the inflation surge surprised the central banking community, external experts and market participants. The unexpected nature of the inflation surge triggered many questions about the performance of macroeconomic forecasters.
At the same time, macroeconomic models can help us understand why the baseline projections did not foresee the inflation surge in its full scale and speed, while shedding light on the possible mechanisms and channels that may have been missed or under-stated. Scenario analysis has been enhanced and new models have been developed to enrich our understanding of the shocks that hit the economy over this period, as well as the mechanisms through which these shocks were transmitted to inflation. Models also play a central role in constructing some of the measures of underlying inflation that the Governing Council uses as an important cross-check for the inflation outlook. And models are essential in constructing policy counterfactuals to assess whether alternative monetary policy responses might have substantially reduced the scale of the inflation surge. Models therefore play an important role in strengthening our understanding of the recent inflationary surge and assessing the monetary policy response.
Model-based retrospective analysis provides several insights into the 2021-2022 inflation surges. The large forecast errors in the inflation outlook over this period were driven, at least initially, by energy and commodity price shocks, especially following the Russia-Ukraine war, and pandemic-related bottlenecks. Subsequently, changes in the transmission of shocks through the pricing chain, and in the behaviour of firms and consumers, likely played an important role in amplifying and propagating these shocks across the economy, converting relative price shocks into a general inflation shock.
Supply shocks, primarily originating from external sources, were key drivers of the inflation surges. While global and domestic surges in sectoral demand patterns also contributed to sectoral demand-supply mismatches (in the goods sector in 2020-2021 during the most intense phases of global pandemic lockdowns; in the services sector in 2022 during the post-pandemic reopening phase), the overall level of aggregate demand in the euro area was only barely above pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022.
The pre-dominant role of supply shocks, combined with the fact that inflation expectations were initially signalling significant downside risks, supported the initial looking-through approach for monetary policy. In this context, it is also essential to recall the sequential nature of the shocks: the focus in 2021 was on pandemic-related supply disruptions and sectoral demand-supply mismatches, while the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 subsequently triggered extraordinary jumps in gas and oil prices.[2]The post-pandemic full-scale reopening of contact-intensive services sectors also took place in early 2022, after the ending of Omicron-related lockdowns. Put together, the second and third quarters of 2022 saw an extraordinary cocktail of inflation shocks, between the war-related commodity and supply chain shocks and the demand-supply mismatches in the reopening contact-intensive service sectors.
If policymakers had had perfect foresight about the shocks that were about to hit the economy, interest rates would have been raised earlier and more sharply. However, conditional on the real-time information available to policymakers (including how this information shaped baseline macroeconomic projections), monetary policy decisions in 2021-2022 were broadly in line with the policy paths indicated by the macroeconomic models.[3]This assessment includes both the initial phase in which monetary policy did not respond to the early stages of the rise in inflation and the subsequent phase of a sharp and sustained tightening cycle. This monetary policy response was, and continues to be, an important contributor to the disinflation process. Macroeconomic models have played a central role in helping policymakers in charting this monetary policy course, through their roles in: (a) macroeconomic forecasting; (b) estimating underlying inflation; and (c) calibrating the appropriate interest rate path.
This assessment puts the spotlight on the quality of the information set available to policymakers, especially in relation to the macroeconomic projections. I will cover this topic in the next section.
The 2021-2022 inflation surges: what did models miss?
The inflation surges in 2021 and 2022 surprised professional forecasters, both at the ECB and across other institutions and countries.[4]Inflation turned out to be much higher and more persistent than had been projected. This is clear from the very large and persistent forecast errors at both short and medium-term horizons in the Eurosystem and ECB staff projections for headline and core inflation.
For example, forecast errors at the one-quarter ahead horizon during this period were more than five times larger than the average errors over the previous twenty years for headline inflation (and around twice as large for core inflation) and had the same direction for several successive quarters (Chart 1, left and middle panels). Indeed, the projection error in the December 2021 Broad Macroeconomic Projection Exercise (BMPE) for the year-over-year inflation rate at the end of 2022 was the largest ever, at around eight percentage points.
Projection errors were also materially larger than historical averages at medium-term horizons, with projections made early in the period suggesting that inflation would either return to target or fall below target well within the projection horizon. The errors in inflation at a four-quarter horizon, for example, were more than nine times larger during 2022 than the historic pre-pandemic average. This is important, since the medium-term inflation outlook is typically the most relevant for policymakers, given significant lags in the transmission of policy rate changes to inflation. The projection errors for GDP growth were smaller than for inflation, but still significantly above their historical range (Chart 1, right panel).
The latest observation is from the September 2024 ECB staff Macroeconomic Projection Exercise (MPE).
In understanding these large forecast errors over 2021-2022, it is important to differentiate between errors due to conditioning assumptions – especially linked to shocks to key variables such as energy or food prices – and errors in the way these assumptions were propagated through the forecasting models.
The starting point for the ECB staff projections is a set of conditioning assumptions for the future evolution of key input variables, known as “technical assumptions”.[5]For example, the paths for inputs such as commodity prices, including oil and gas prices, and short-term interest rates are based on market expectations at the time of the projection cut-off date.[6]The right panel of Chart 2 shows that the expected paths for oil and gas prices were revised up repeatedly over successive projection rounds at the end of 2021 and throughout 2022. This highlights how energy prices were repeatedly expected by markets – and therefore by our projection models – to decline. However, a sequence of upward surprises to energy prices materialised, especially following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This sequence of shocks pushed up inflation and compounded forecast errors over successive projection rounds.
In order to quantify the importance of energy price and other shocks in driving inflation projection errors, we can use models to construct counterfactual paths for inflation under a scenario in which forecasters had perfect foresight at each projection round about how energy prices and other conditioning variables would actually evolve over the projection horizon. This allows projection errors from incorrect technical assumptions to be isolated from the errors related to thetransmissionof shocks as embedded in models. Of course, the results from such a decomposition depend on the specific model. It is also important to keep in mind that the ECB/Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections are not purely model based but also include staff judgement.[7]
One way to carry out this counterfactual exercise is to use the Basic Model Elasticities (BMEs) of the Eurosystem national central banks (NCBs), which summarise the key relations between projection variables.[8]This exercise suggests that a substantial share of forecast errors for inflation during 2021 and 2022 was due to errors in the technical assumptions.[9]For example, errors in assumptions about oil and gas prices accounted for the majority of the one-quarter ahead inflation projection error until early 2022 (yellow and green bars in Chart 3).[10]Subsequently, however, the importance of other factors affecting food and core inflation grew in importance.
Further insight can be gained by running this counterfactual exercise in a fully-fledged macroeconomic model. ECB-BASE is the workhorse large-scale estimated semi-structural model used at the ECB to support and cross-check the staff projection exercises.[11]Decomposing the eight percentage point projection error at the peak of inflation in the fourth quarter of 2022 – relative to what had been projected in December 2021 – confirms that around half was due to unexpected developments in technical assumptions around oil and gas prices (red and yellow bars in Chart 4). Nearly one third, on the other hand, was due to errors in food inflation (dark grey bar in Chart 4), while the remainder was due to other factors that drove the error in core inflation (light grey bars in Chart 4). As such, errors in the set of technical assumptions go a long way towards explaining the forecast errors.[12]
At the same time, a sizeable share of the inflation forecast errors over this period cannot be explained by errors in the assumptions around energy and food prices. Two explanations for the remaining errors seem plausible.
The first explanation relates to statistical uncertainty. Macroeconomic forecasting models are underpinned by empirical estimates of model relations that are based on historical regularities. Statistical uncertainty around these estimates maps into statistical uncertainty around the central tendency of the inflation projection. Conditioning on the ex-post values for the technical assumptions, the statistical distribution around the inflation projections from the vantage point of December 2021 is relatively wide (Chart 4, blue area).[13]The actual inflation outturns (solid blue line in Chart 4) experienced during the inflation surge were close to the bounds of this model uncertainty, although inflation was still slightly too high to be compatible with the model in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023.
Overall, correcting for the actual path of energy prices and other conditioning variables, it cannot be ruled out that actual inflation was largely consistent with the historically-estimated statistical distribution around forecasts. This would imply that the economic relations estimated in the models to capture the transmission of shocks to inflation have remained broadly valid during the inflation surge, so long as the full statistical distribution is taken into account.
The second explanation is that economic relations might also have (temporarily) shifted during this extraordinary episode, including through an array of non-linear responses to the scale and combination of the shocks and the shift in the level of inflation. For example, in a high inflation environment, firms may adjust their prices more often than normal, in an attempt to pass on rapidly rising input and operational costs and protect their profits.[14]Furthermore, the broadening of the inflation shock from the energy sector (including via the food sector) to the services sector may also have been amplified during 2022 by the strong demand for contact-intensive services (tourism, hospitality) due to the reopening of these sectors after the final pandemic lockdowns. While costs were increasing quickly, the price elasticity of demand for services was plausibly atypically low due to this pandemic reopening phase, allowing for a greater pass-through of the cost shocks.
Furthermore, these conditions were ripe for a non-linear responses feedback loop between inflation and short-term inflation expectations. It is plausible that short-term inflation expectations are more sensitive to large inflation shocks than to small inflation shocks. Although longer-term inflation expectations remained broadly stable throughout, perceptions of past inflation and short-term expected inflation rates did increase in response to the inflation surges. In the event of a large inflation shock, an increase in near-term inflation expectations may take hold among households and firms, with firms anxious to avoid suffering relative price declines and households more likely to attribute individual price increases to general inflation than to a relative price increase.
Indeed, the evidence suggests that there was a marked increase in the frequency of price increases over the course of 2022 (Chart 5).[15]This state-dependent increase in the frequency of price adjustments resulted in the faster-than-normal pass-through of the unique and large sectoral shocks. In terms of the key Phillips Curve macroeconomic relation between slack and inflation (whether at aggregate or sectoral levels), this can be interpreted as some combination of a shift up in the curve and an increase in the slope of the Phillips Curve. And indeed, estimates from a time-varying parameter model show some increase in the slope of the Phillips curve from early 2021 (Chart 6, left panel). Furthermore, the evidence based on sectoral data also shows a shift in the correlation between sectoral capacity utilisation and sectoral prices increases (Chart 6, right panel).[16]While the 2021-2022 inflation surges should not be interpreted as primarily originating in the recovery of product and labour markets from the 2020 pandemic lows, the domestic rebound added to overall inflationary pressures. I return to the contribution of domestic demand in the next section.
Faced with large forecast errors and significant uncertainty, ECB staff worked to develop new models and enhance the scenario analysis in the policy process. The new models developed include models of underlying inflation, satellite models that allow for alternative transmission channels, and machine learning models that try to allow for important non-linearities.[17]Each of these approaches can help to cross-check projections from the main forecasting models. In turn, the staff judgement element in the forecasting process enables the incorporation of the results from these supplementary analytical exercises, both in the baseline and in the risk assessment. No doubt the lessons learned from the 2021-2022 high inflation episode will prove to be especially valuable in the future if a similar configuration of shocks were to arise.
The recent experience certainly highlights the risks of over-reliance on baseline projections. Scenarios can be an effective way to represent risks when uncertainty is large or hard to quantify.[18]In 2020 and 2021, each set of quarterly staff projections included scenario analyses based on alternative assumptions regarding the future evolution of the pandemic and its economic consequences. In 2022, alternative scenarios focused on the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine, especially as regards uncertainties about energy supply. More recently, the scenario analysis has focused on more specific risks, such as a slowdown in the Chinese economy or a potential escalation of the conflict in the Red Sea area. In my May 2024 Stanford speech, I discussed how these alternative scenarios can be used to construct policy counterfactuals and will go into more details in a forthcoming speech on the use of scenarios to assess the robustness of alternative policy paths.[19]In addition to scenario analysis, the macroeconomic projections are accompanied by a large set of sensitivity analyses in relation to shifts in the technical assumptions and alternative parameter choices in model calibration.
Demand versus supply shocks
Models have also been deployed to interpret forecast errors through the lens of identified structural shocks and to quantify their contribution to inflation. Estimates from a large structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model – which employs sign and zero restrictions to identify the global and domestic demand and supply shocks driving deviations of inflation from the model-implied mean – indicate that external supply shocks were the main driver of the initial inflation surge in the euro area, although shocks to external demand and domestic demand also played a role, especially during 2022 (Chart 7).[20]
In particular, the shock decomposition points to various phases. The initial inflation increase was mainly driven by global supply shocks, related to supply chain disruptions, surging oil and gas prices and higher commodity prices more generally. These results supported an initially-circumspect monetary policy response, as the central bank still gathered evidence about the persistence of the inflation shock and its likelihood to affect materially expectations and other behavioural relations in the economy. In particular, in the absence of a clear understanding of the nature and expected persistence of the shocks, a more patient and deliberate policy response that weighs up the risks to different options, appeared appropriate.
In a second phase, the indirect effects from energy and food price spikes, as well as supply chain bottlenecks, passing through into core inflation led to the broadening of inflation pressures. Increasing demand, in particular in supply-constrained contact-intensive services, such as tourism and hospitality, added to inflationary pressures. Together with the risk that high inflation might de-stabilise inflation expectations, the increasing contribution of domestic demand add to the case for the aggressive monetary policy reaction that took place in this phase. In a third phase, as the energy and supply chain disruptions abated and monetary policy dampened demand, headline inflation started to decline rapidly.
Of course, inference is sensitive to the type of model and the set of identifying assumptions.[21]A key challenge is to correctly capture the information set. A model needs to contain sufficient information to span the space of the structural shocks of interest. Otherwise, the correct shocks cannot be recovered from the history of observed variables. In stylised terms, the larger the model (or the more variables that are included), the more room there is to control for the different factors that affect inflation and, in particular, to separate out shocks from structural drivers.
This is particularly relevant when inflation is driven by a multifaceted and unusual set of shocks and structural drivers, originating both at home and abroad, as was the case over the 2021-2022 period. The dramatic fallout from the pandemic and the rapid bounce back following the reopening of economies after lockdowns are cases in point. In turn, amongst its many other effects, the shock of the Russian invasion of Ukraine constituted an extraordinarily-disruptive supply shock to the energy sector. As it turns out, models that rely on a small information set tend to assign a stronger role to demand factors and predict over-smooth dynamics of inflation and growth because such small-scale models are not designed to capture the type of sudden changes witnessed in that episode.[22]
The policy implications of model-based identification of demand and supply influences are not always easy to draw. That is, the policy implications not only depend on the source and nature of the shock but also its size and persistence. For example, a supply shock that is highly transitory (such as a temporary limitation in oil production in response to a short-lived geopolitical event) or a temporary surge in sectoral demand during the pandemic reopening phase (compounded by initially-limited supply capacity in the contact-intensive services sectors) may call for a looking-through policy response given the significant lags in the transmission of monetary policy.[23]By contrast, a string of large and persistent supply shocks in the same direction requires central banks to tighten in order to avoid  longer-lasting inflation effects via wage-price spirals and dislocations in expectations.
In relation to the latter risk, the de-anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations warrants close monitoring, and models can help policymakers understand the risks of de-anchoring under alternative shocks and scenarios. For instance, simulations using a regime-switching DSGE model suggest that substantial downward de-anchoring risks prevailed throughout most of 2021, due to the low inflation of the previous periods exerting a persistent dampening effect on expectations as well as the initial inflationary shocks being largely understood to be temporary in nature.[24]The further increase in inflation in early 2022 saw a rapid decline in downward de-anchoring risks and an increase in upward de-anchoring risks. The forceful policy response over the course of 2022 and 2023 helped to limit, and then reduce, these upward de-anchoring risks (Chart 8). Later on, risks became more balanced as inflation came down tangibly.
The speed and strength of monetary policy transmission is also important when calibrating the appropriate monetary policy response.[25]Provided that monetary policy tightening transmits through to inflation in line with historical regularities, then our models should provide a good guide as to how fast and how far policy rates would need to be increased in response to the inflation shock. However, there is evidence that the aggressive rate hikes in response to inflation, and the highly restrictive monetary policy stance, have resulted in a faster-than-expected rise in lending rates as well as a larger contraction in credit flows, in particular to firms (Chart 9). This is important, because stronger-than-expected transmission would, all else being equal, call for smaller, or more gradual, rate increases in response to rising inflation.
Cross-checking the outlook with measures of underlying inflation
The high level of uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook over the 2021-2022 period called for the development of additional metrics to distinguish between temporary and more long-lasting inflation dynamics. Models played an important role in the development of underlying measures of inflation, which aim to filter out the short-term volatility in headline inflation and better capture the low-frequency component of inflation. Such metrics provide a useful cross-check to the inflation projections, especially in times of elevated uncertainty.
Most measures of underlying inflation have come down significantly from their peak (Chart 10).[26]Exclusion-based measures, which peaked around the beginning of 2023 have fallen steadily, and now sit just below three per cent. Model-based measures of Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI) measures, which have tended to perform the best in predicting HICP inflation since the pandemic, peaked earlier (around the middle of 2022) before declining quickly, and have now hovered around two per cent for several months.[27]
In interpreting measures of underlying inflation, it is important to keep in mind that these can be temporarily distorted by the economy-wide impact of cost shocks such as bottlenecks and energy shocks. Models can be used to “partial out” these influences from the underlying inflation measures to give a better sense of the medium-term dynamics of inflation. These adjusted measures had a significantly lower peak rate of underlying inflation than the unadjusted measures but, by construction, were also less affected by the sharp turnaround in energy prices and easing of supply bottlenecks during 2023 that flattered the speed of progress in the unadjusted measures.
It is also important to understand what the various measures tell us about the speed and sequencing of the disinflation process. The delayed and lagged adjustment in indicators such as services inflation, domestic inflation and wage growth highlight that convergence to the medium-term target may still take time. It will be important to continue to monitor developments in domestic inflation, which has declined only slowly, mainly due to the delayed adjustment in services inflation, which itself is closely linked to wage developments.[28]
Policy counterfactuals
The complex shocks that hit the euro area economy in 2021 and 2022 and the high inflation which emerged also raise the question of the appropriate monetary policy response of the ECB. This can be analysed by constructing policy counterfactuals that give an indication of what would have happened to inflation had the ECB acted differently. Staff use macroeconomic models to build these counterfactuals in real time, under different assumptions for the policy rate path and the expected path for inflation and growth. But the same models can also be used to construct counterfactuals with the benefit of hindsight, thus providing insight on what appropriate monetary policy might have looked like had the extent of the inflation surge been known from the outset.
As an example, counterfactuals can be constructed using two policy models developed by ECB staff: the MMR model and the NAWM model.[29]Given projections for inflation and a measure of economic slack, as well as assumptions about the interest rate path, it is possible to construct policy paths that minimise a loss function featuring squared terms for the deviation of inflation from target, the output gap, and the change in the interest rate. The last term is a proxy for financial or other stress that could be created if the monetary stance changes very rapidly.[30]According to the model simulations, had the exact nature and size of shocks that were about to hit the economy been known back in the fourth quarter of 2021, the model-implied optimal policy (as defined by the minimisation of this loss function) would have called for interest rates to be increased earlier and more forcefully (Chart 11 black dashed). Inflation would have peaked at around 8 per cent rather than the 10 per cent observed in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, this tightening would have come with large output costs, with quarter-on-quarter growth rates 1 to 2 percentage points lower, depending on the model.
Of course, the ECB did not possess perfect foresight. The projections by ECB and Eurosystem staff, as well as those of other forecasters, predicted much lower and less persistent inflation as the baseline. In looking at the policy paths that were constructed using the actual information available to policymakers at the time – as reflected in the ECB/Eurosystem staff projections for inflation and growth – it shows the actual interest rate path during the hiking cycle was broadly in line with the model-implied optimal policy path (Chart 11, blue lines vs. coloured lines).
Two instances can be identified in the MMR model in which the model-implied optimal policy prescriptions differed slightly from the path of interest rates followed by the ECB. The first instance was in early 2022, when optimal policy would have called for interest rate hikes already in the first quarter. The implications of this delayed start to rate hikes can be assessed by comparing inflation outcomes under a counterfactual in which the optimal interest rate path is constrained not to increase until the time in which the ECB started increasing rates and under the alternative assumption that the rate path is unconstrained. The inflation outcomes in the two cases are very close to each other, in the order a few basis points, suggesting that small changes in the exact timing of lift off were not consequential: what matters in the model is the overall direction of travel of monetary policy rather than whether one rate action is brought forward or backward by one quarter. The second episode (not shown in the chart) was in September 2023 when the model-implied optimal policy would have called for one fewer interest rate hike.
However, the model-implied optimal policy path should be checked against an array of risk considerations. The optimal policy paths above are drawn around the central tendency of the BMPE projections: especially during periods of high uncertainty about the macroeconomic outcomes, it is prudent to also consider alternative scenarios. In particular, choosing a policy path that avoids the worst scenario from happening is a form of insurance and can in practice call for either a more aggressive or more gradual policy response than indicated by a simple loss function that is conditioned on the baseline projections.[31][32]
Policy models can also be employed to compute counterfactuals to quantify the impact of the actual monetary policy tightening on the disinflation process. The exercise is conducted using the ECB’s main policy models – NAWM, MMR and ECB-BASE.[33]According to these models, without the unprecedented tightening, inflation would have been about two percentage points higher on average in each year between 2023 and 2026 (Chart 13). The exact effects of monetary policy on inflation and output are subject to significant uncertainty and depend, among other things, on the assumed expectations formation process in the model. Semi-structural models such as the ECB-BASE have typically more backward-looking expectations, resulting in a slower propagation of shocks and thus smaller effects from monetary policy. By contrast, the effects can be larger in DSGE models, such as NAWM and MMR due to the strong forward-looking behaviour of agents in these models. In addition, monetary policy likely had an additional important role in keeping long-term inflation expectations anchored: that is not incorporated in the quantification of the impact of policy tightening reported above.[34]
The message emerging from these results indicates that monetary policy has played a significant role in contributing to the disinflation process and, given the information available at the time, it did so at a rather appropriate pace.
As noted above, the policy simulations that condition on baseline projections alone suggest that the first increase in interest rates should have been implemented about a quarter earlier. But several other considerations beyond those captured in these models were relevant to the monetary policy decisions taken in the spring of 2022, especially in the context of the uncertainty surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A slightly earlier lift-off would only have had a very limited effect in dampening the scale of the inflation surge and a one quarter delay in liftoff provided insurance against the risks of tightening too early. Of course, as indicated earlier, the monetary policy tightening would have occurred at a significantly earlier date if the scale and persistence of the inflation shock had been better anticipated: the projections in early 2022 still signalled a return to below-target inflation over the medium term as they could not foresee as central tendency the protracted war in Ukraine and the drastic disruptions in the supply of Russian gas to some European countries.
The final hike at the September 2023 meeting also incorporated risk management considerations.[35]In particular, in view of some signs of an increase in inflation risks over the course of the summer, it was judged to be safer to increase the policy rate by a further 25 basis points, which would reinforce progress towards the target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolved in line with the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation would return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path. In consequence, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.
Conclusions
My remarks today have sought to explain how macroeconomic models have been deployed at the ECB to help understand the 2021-2022 inflation surges and the appropriate monetary policy response. While models have their limitations, models can help us understand where and how our projections fell short. Models are also essential in the construction of scenarios and policy counterfactuals, which play an important role in the policy making process.
The model-based analyses reported in this speech suggest that forecast errors in the inflation outlook were initially driven by unanticipated energy price shocks but that multiple changes in the transmission of shocks to inflation also played an important role in the broadening of the inflation shock, increasing its size and persistence.
If the ECB had had perfect foresight in late 2021 on the exact nature and size of shocks that were about to hit the economy, the model-implied optimal policy would have called for interest rates to be increased more rapidly and more aggressively. Inflation would have peaked at around 8 per cent rather than the 10 per cent observed in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, this tightening would have come with large output costs, with quarter-on-quarter growth ending up 1 to 2 percentage points lower, depending on the model.
Without the benefit of hindsight, the model-based analysis indicates that monetary policy was set in a broadly appropriate manner during 2021 and 2022, given the real-time information available to policymakers (including as incorporated in the baseline macroeconomic projections). While some risk considerations might have called for an earlier start to the hiking cycle, other risk considerations pushed in the opposite direction (including the uncertainty associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine). In any event, the model analysis included in this speech suggests that minor variations in the start date would not have had a large impact. Most important, the interest rate path actually followed has delivered substantial and timely progress in disinflation."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Frankfurt Euro Finance Week, organised by thedfvEuro Finance Group
Frankfurt am Main, 18 November 2024
It is my great pleasure to continue the tradition of joining you at the Frankfurt Euro Finance Week. In today’s remarks I will provide you with our latest assessment of the risks to financial stability in the euro area, which we will soon publish in more detail in the ECB’s Financial Stability Review – a publication that celebrates its twentieth anniversary this week. I will then discuss the resilience of euro area banks and non-banks. And finally, with Europe at the crossroads, I will emphasise the importance of strengthening financial integration, completing banking union and moving forward on the capital markets union.
Volatile and uncertain macro-financial outlook
If you look at where we are now compared with a year ago, the balance of macro-risks has shifted from concerns about high inflation to fears over economic growth. Consumer price inflation has moved closer to our 2% target. But economic activity has been weaker than expected: we have revised down our projections twice – before the summer and in September. The growth outlook is clouded by uncertainty about economic policies and the geopolitical landscape, both in the euro area and globally. Trade tensions could rise further, increasing the risk of tail events materialising. These cyclical headwinds compound structural issues of low productivity and weak potential euro area growth.
Against a background of heightened uncertainty, our upcoming Financial Stability Review highlights three main vulnerabilities that shape the euro area outlook.
Key financial stability vulnerabilities
The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence. Given how deeply integrated global equity markets are, negative firm-specific or sector-specific surprises could easily spill-over across the borders.
The second vulnerability relates to rising sovereign risks. While the aggregate euro area debt-to-GDP ratio has declined considerably from its peak during the pandemic, debt levels remain high in many countries owing to persistent primary deficits. Under these circumstances, fiscal slippage or questions around fiscal consolidation paths could trigger further repricing of sovereign risk. Current large primary deficits will also make it harder for governments to support the economy if adverse shocks materialise, and they will make it more difficult to provide additional investment to cope with structural challenges, including climate change, defence spending, digitalisation and low productivity. This in turn could give rise to a negative feedback loop between low growth and sovereign debt sustainability.
The third vulnerability relates to credit risk. Amid weak growth prospects, credit risk remains a concern for some euro area firms and households and could affect asset quality of banks and non-banks. Overall, firms and households have weathered the impact of past interest rate increases and appear resilient generally. Nevertheless high – albeit declining – lending rates remain a challenge for some borrowers. Insolvencies – a lagged indicator of corporate financial health – have been rising across sectors and countries, although from relatively low levels. The debt servicing capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises and of commercial real estate firms appears to be particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic activity and higher borrowing costs. At the same time, the euro area commercial real estate markets show signs of stabilisation, with investor demand slowly recovering, in line with less restrictive monetary policy. In addition, higher interest rates continue to challenge households with lower incomes and floating-rate mortgages. Slower growth and a weakening labour market could further undermine the debt servicing capacity of these borrowers.
Financial sector’s resilience
The previous point in particular raises the question: are euro area financial institutions well prepared to cope with these risks?
Here the good news is that bank balance sheets are strong, making it easier for banks to absorb losses, if asset quality deterioration were to accelerate. Lower operating expenses and strong net interest margins have enabled euro area banks to maintain high levels of profitability. Banking sector resilience is bolstered by solid capital ratios and liquidity buffers, despite the gradual phasing-out of funding from targeted longer-term refinancing operations. That being said, bank profitability may have peaked, with earnings on floating-rate assets becoming a headwind for interest income and credit losses starting to rise.
Turning to the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector, non-banks remain vulnerable to, and could amplify, macroeconomic and financial market shocks. A significant proportion of non-banks’ holdings – especially of corporate bonds and equities – are from issuers in countries projected to experience low economic growth and high levels of sovereign debt. Consequently, any potential downturn could weigh on asset quality in NBFI portfolios. Additionally, the rising exposure of the NBFI sector to global markets, including US-based technology firms, makes non-banks vulnerable to shocks and volatility in those markets. This could expose the sector to sudden sharp declines in asset values and returns, putting further strain on their resilience.
Some segments of the NBFI sector also face structural vulnerabilities related to liquidity mismatches and high leverage. These issues make the sector more susceptible to amplifying shocks through forced asset sales. When asset values or returns decline sharply, open-ended investment funds – such as real estate funds – may be forced to sell assets to meet redemption demands. This risk is heightened in sectors like commercial real estate, as in some euro area countries a potential fall in property prices has not yet been fully reflected in fund valuations. This implies that the risk of price corrections and subsequent outflows remains elevated.
Furthermore, pockets of high financial and synthetic leverage in the investment fund sector – most notably in hedge funds – introduces another layer of vulnerability. As we have seen in previous crises, leverage can magnify losses, making the sector more prone to systemic risks in times of market stress.
Safeguarding resilience and strengthening financial integration
Looking at the current highly uncertain geopolitical and economic environment, regulatory standards remain key to preserve the resilience of banks and non-banks’ alike. Existing macroprudential capital buffer requirements for banks as well as borrower-based measures should be maintained. In this context, it is reassuring that the final elements of Basel III were implemented in EU law in June 2024.
While sound capital and liquidity buffers are the first line of defence against bank failures, they must be complemented by steady and agile supervision in a full banking union. Our work on this front is not yet done. To complete the banking union, we must address key gaps in our institutional framework. This includes finalising the crisis management toolkit for EU large banks and making progress in other areas, such as liquidity in resolution and a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. A critical gap that demands attention is the absence of a European deposit insurance scheme.[1]Progress towards a full banking union that would remove barriers to greater financial system integration across euro area countries remains a priority if we want to make our banking system more efficient.
It is also essential to strengthen the resilience of the NBFI sector, not only to protect individual institutions but also to safeguard the broader stability of the financial system, especially since a more resilient non-bank sector will reduce the likelihood of spillovers to the banking sector.[2]A sound NBFI sector is also a prerequisite for achieving deeper financial integration in the euro area and completing of the capital markets union.
Progress on the capital markets union should be central to a revised strategy to enhance Europe’s productivity and economic growth. Greater economic integration goes hand-in-hand with greater financial integration. By mobilising capital markets more effectively, we can deepen the Single Market and provide much-needed financing to innovative and productive firms across Europe. This is crucial for supporting long-term growth and securing the financing of the green transition.
However, achieving these objectives will not be without its challenges. The ambition to strengthen capital markets must be accompanied by concrete policies. A more prominent role for the non-bank financial sector should go along with a robust macroprudential framework to ensure its resilience. The European Commission’s consultation on macroprudential policies for NBFI is an important step toward addressing the risks in this industry.
Let me conclude with a clear message on the financial sector. Now is not the time to roll back hard- won regulatory progress. With sources of risk and vulnerability remaining elevated against a background of great uncertainty and weak growth prospects, our current moment is one for upholding regulation, preserving resilience and pressing ahead with macroprudential policies for non-banks. A stronger and stable financial system with developed capital markets can be a vital engine of growth for Europe in the years ahead."

Contribution by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, to the Centre for European Reform’s annual economics conference on “A European path to higher economic growth”
Ditchley Park, 15 November 2024
Thank you for inviting me to discuss whether a “hot” economy can drive productivity growth.
A lot has been said recently about the structural reasons for the productivity gap between Europe and the United States, notably in Mario Draghi’s recent report.[1]
But this gap has worsened in the post-pandemic period, as productivity growth accelerated in the United States and stalled in the euro area (Chart 1). The hotter US economy largely explains this, whereas the euro area economy caught a cold as a result of the energy shock to which it was much more exposed.[2]
So today, I want to discuss how a strong recovery in productivity is critical for the euro area. Beyond its short-term benefit, it is also essential to avoiding a further erosion of the euro area’s economic potential. Monetary policy should take the medium and long-term effects of an excessively restrictive stance into account.[3]
The conditions for a cyclical recovery in euro area productivity
Earlier this year, I noted that unwinding supply shocks are creating an opportunity for recovery in the euro area economy, by making it possible to achieve lower inflation and higher growth simultaneously. I therefore argued for letting the recovery proceed by allowing for wages to rebound in the short term – thus recouping past real income losses. And I indicated that the improving inflation outlook should give us the confidence to dial back monetary policy restriction. This in turn would help the economy and productivity to pick up, with wages gradually moderating over the medium term to be consistent with trend productivity growth and our inflation target.[4]
So how far have we come on this path to a healthier economic environment?
As expected, the unwinding of the energy shock has allowed headline inflation to continue its decline in recent months, falling to 2% in October (Chart 2). Although headline inflation will be bumpy in coming months because of energy base effects, we expect it to converge to 2% in the course of 2025.
Indicators of underlying inflation have also moderated somewhat (Chart 3).[5]Core inflation fell to 2.7% in October. Domestic inflation remains high, as services inflation tends to lag headline inflation, and is sustained by the wage catch-up in the short term. But the ECB’s measure of the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI)[6], a more forward-looking indicator of underlying inflationary pressures that tends to be a better predictor of future inflation, stood at 2% in September, the last month for which this statistic is available.
This encouraging picture is further supported by market-based inflation expectations and fixings[7], which stand around 2% (Chart 4, left-hand panel). The option-implied risk-neutral distribution of average inflation over the next two years is now more balanced, around 2%, albeit assigning increasing probability to inflation rates below 2% (Chart 4, right-hand panel).
Lower inflation has contributed to a recovery in real income. This recovery has also been supported by the catch-up in wages, which has brought real wage developments more in line with those of productivity since the onset of the pandemic (Chart 5).
At the same time, unit labour costs growth has been buffered by lower unit profits and import prices. This has allowed the total supply deflator, which has provided a good early indicator of HICP inflation since the pandemic, to moderate to between 1.5% and 1.7% over the past year (Chart 6).
Moreover, the forward-looking wage tracker is consistent with a gradual moderation of wages in the coming year (Chart 7), in line with the outlook embedded in our projections, after rising further this year. This moderation should be supported by the gradual cooling down in labour market dynamics (Chart 8).
After several quarters of stagnation, euro area GDP growth has gradually increased, with annual GDP growth rising from 0.1% in the last quarter of 2023 to 0.9% in the third quarter of this year.
However, we are seeing contrasting signals.
First, domestic demand remained weak in the second quarter of 2024, as the small positive contribution of consumption was counterbalanced by a decline in investment (Chart 9). Initial indications suggest that consumption gathered pace in the third quarter, while investment contracted further.
Second, activity and economic sentiment have been very uneven across sectors, with manufacturing underperforming compared with services (Chart 10). This is also reflected in a reduction of inventories amid low capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, which has dragged down euro area growth over the past year (Chart 9).
These developments remain consistent with a gradual, consumption-led recovery, but this has not yet allowed for a turn in the investment cycle. Moreover, growth figures for the third quarter benefited from summer events such as the Olympics. Whether the recovery will firm up therefore remains to be confirmed and risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside.
The overall picture of a gradual and heterogenous recovery amid a resilient labour market also implies a slow cyclical recovery in labour productivity, with uneven developments across sectors (Chart 11).
This suggests that some factors have been slowing the upturn in consumption and holding back investment, delaying a cyclical recovery in productivity.
Risks to a cyclical recovery in euro area productivity
Three aspects warrant particular attention: households’ saving behaviour, the impact of monetary policy restriction and uncertainty associated with global economic policy.
Let me start with the first aspect. In recent quarters, households have allocated a portion of their increased real income to restoring their financial buffers or deleveraging. The saving ratio has increased, as household spending has not kept up with growth in real disposable income (Chart 12, left-hand panel). Empirical estimates suggest that high interest rates and a loss in households’ real net wealth have been key factors in this development (Chart 12, right-hand panel).
The effect is heterogenous across the household income distribution. Lower-income households – who are spending more relative to their income (Chart 13) – have accumulated almost no excess savings since the onset of the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic trend (Chart 14).[8]Because of budget constraints, these households had to reduce their savings more than others in response to the energy price spike (Chart 15).They also had to rely more heavily on consumer loans, despite rising interest rates, to avoid reducing essential consumption.[9]This points to the need for lower-income households to deleverage and shore up their balance sheets as real income improves.
Conversely, higher-income households, who are more likely to be net savers, have benefited from higher interest rates. In the first half of this year, euro area non-labour income, such as net interest receipts and dividends, rose by 4.1%, which is more than twice the increase seen in 2015-19.
A tentative signal of a possible change in households’ recent saving behaviour is that recent data from the Consumer Expectations Survey are pointing to a decline in savings (Chart 12, left-hand panel). At the same time, the data confirm there is heterogeneity across the household income distribution (Chart 16, left-hand panel). Survey responses also indicate that households with an adjustable-rate mortgage already experienced an increase in their interest payments and a corresponding drop in their saving rate in the last two years, while those with fixed-rate mortgages increased their saving rate (Chart 16, right-hand panel).
This brings me to the second aspect: the effects of monetary policy restriction. After the sharpest monetary policy tightening in the ECB’s history – ten consecutive hikes that raised our policy rate by 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023 – followed by a period of holding rates steady, we have gradually dialled back restriction since June. Markets expect us to continue bringing rates down to a neutral level, within the range of natural rate estimates (Chart 17).[10]
However, it will take some time for the dialling back of monetary policy restriction to transmit to lending rates and loan demand. Lending rates have only just started to decline for new loans and stabilise for outstanding amounts (Chart 18). Lending to firms remains weak, while lending to households has shown signs of improvement from a low level (Chart 19).
The further transmission of our less restrictive stance will also depend on confidence that we will gradually but surely lower our policy rates further toward neutral levels. While the direction is clear, we are following a meeting-by-meeting approach, enabling us to adjust the pace and extent of rate cuts depending on our assessment of incoming data.
Dialling back monetary policy restriction should support investment. It should also provide relief to households, especially at the bottom of the wealth distribution[11], and thus boost the consumption-led recovery, supporting the positive effects from rising labour income.
At the same time, the path towards a neutral stance should also take into account that credit supply to firms is still very weak, amid tight credit conditions and signs of deteriorating bank asset quality due to an increase in underperforming and non-performing loans. In addition, the incipient recovery in lending to households has to be balanced against the high level of credit application rejections and signs of higher default rates on consumer loans. Moreover, bank lending conditions in the coming months could be further influenced by reduced liquidity in the system as the central bank balance sheet continues to shrink.
Let me now turn to the third key aspect: risks from global policy developments. Recent global political developments increase risks of disruption to the cyclical recovery of productivity in the euro area and have implications for how far we can support this recovery with our monetary policy, given the possible effects on inflation.
The prospect of higher trade tariffs being implemented by the United States could significantly weigh on activity, especially in manufacturing, because of the impact on euro area confidence, exports and investment. Moreover, political uncertainty in some euro area countries – which reduces the predictability of fiscal and economic policy – could weigh on consumer confidence and firms’ investment decisions. In countries with higher fiscal deficits, this could also increase Ricardian effects, where the support to economic activity from a loose fiscal stance is blunted by the expectation that fiscal policy will need to be tightened in the future.
These developments could in turn put downward pressure on euro area inflation, as a result of the impact on demand, global confidence, and the likely reorientation of third-country exports away from the US and to the euro area, which would weigh on import prices. However, these disinflationary effects could be countervailed by the depreciation of the euro exchange rate and tariff retaliation, which would increase the prices of imported goods.
An increase in US oil production, combined with the negative effects of tariffs on global activity and thus oil demand, could push oil prices down. This would counterbalance upward risks to oil prices arising from current geopolitical conflicts.
Implications for the euro area’s economic potential
Overall, this paints a picture of nascent recovery that is still fragile.
While there is some uncertainty around estimates of the level of the neutral rate given their wide range (Chart 17), downward risks to inflation have been increasing and risks to the economic outlook are tilted to the downside.
A risk management approach also needs to consider the medium to long-term negative consequences we would incur if our monetary policy proved to be out of step with the evolving balance of risks and thus remained too restrictive for too long.
It could be self-defeating to tolerate an economy running persistently below potential as an insurance against possible future inflationary shocks. Such a tactic could lower potential growth, thereby weakening the economy’s resilience to both demand and supply shocks.
Three key elements need to be considered when assessing the costs of running an economy cold – in other words, below its potential – for a long time. These are the effects on capital accumulation, human capital and structural reforms.
Consider capital accumulation.
Investment has been stagnating, or even declining, in the euro area in recent quarters, adding a cyclical shortfall to the existing structural gap with respect to the United States (Chart 20). This is likely to weigh on productivity growth given the role of capital accumulation (Chart 21).
While the weak productivity growth seen since the pandemic is potentially a short-lived phenomenon reflecting firms’ response to a temporary change in the relative prices of labour, capital and energy, the long-run trend may be permanently scarred by the current slow or declining pace of capital accumulation. The absence of investment growth not only reduces labour productivity by hampering capital deepening, but is also likely to weigh on total factor productivity growth by reducing the adoption and production of new technologies.[12]
Excessive restriction could also have implications for human capital.
Demographic trends and increased obsolescence of skills caused by technological transformation imply a shortage of deployable human capital. Under these conditions, any slack in the labour market and further underinvestment in adequately equipping the workforce would lead to a further loss of scarce resources that should instead be fully mobilised, not least to enable workers to update their skill sets and increase their employability in the light of fast-changing labour demand.
Finally, excessive restriction could have implications for our ability to address the structural dimension of the productivity gap. Structural reforms are hard to implement, as they imply costs for those that are displaced.[13]Their implementation is thus easier when the economy is running at potential, as confirmed by the literature.[14]This indeed creates room for public finance to reduce the risk that some end up worse-off as a result of the reforms, facilitating a Pareto efficient outcome. And it is easier to reallocate capital and labour when they are in high demand.
In summary, imposing more restriction than necessary on the economy in the short term could have transitory and also permanent costs, as it could exercise significant negative influence on total factor productivity dynamics via weak capital accumulation[15], depletion of human capital and a slower pace in implementing structural reforms. This would reduce economic potential, and thus affect the speed limit of the economy – that is, the level at which GDP growth becomes inflationary.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In the euro area, labour productivity tends to be strongly affected by the business cycle.[16]For productivity growth to rebound fully, we need the nascent signs of economic recovery to firm up.
The unwinding of the energy shock and the associated decline in inflation have allowed us to start dialling back monetary restriction. This should support investment and reinforce the effect of rising real incomes on consumption, especially for lower-income households.
The current balance of risks suggests that we can and should reduce further the current level of monetary policy restriction. The pace and extent of this reduction will depend on the incoming data.
A cyclical recovery in productivity would support the disinflationary process in the euro area and reduce the risk of permanent scars on the euro area’s economic potential. So we should not be more restrictive than what is necessary to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to our 2% target.
We do not want an overheated economy. But we do want to see our economy reach the right temperature, which would certainly be hotter than it has been recently.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 25th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference
Washington, D.C., 14 November 2024
Over the past few years, monetary policy has had to change course in an unprecedented way. Faced with persistently low inflation, central banks in many advanced economies had lowered policy rates to record low levels and bought significant amounts of assets to bring inflation back to target.
When the pandemic hit and inflation surged as our economies reopened, central banks responded by raising policy rates sharply to restore price stability and anchor inflation expectations. They also started to gradually reduce their balance sheets, further removing policy accommodation.
Although the fight against inflation has not yet been won, with domestic price pressures remaining high, it is time for central banks to start reflecting on the lessons that can be learned from these episodes of low and high inflation.
My main message today is that, in a volatile macroeconomic environment, central banks need to be more agile, meaning they should draw primarily on instruments that can be reversed quickly and that allow monetary policy to be adjusted swiftly to changing economic conditions.[1]
Central banks cannot rely on stable macroeconomic relationships
Since the pandemic, the macroeconomic environment has changed in three important ways.
First, the recent surge in inflation showed that large and persistent inflationary episodes are not confined to the past, when central banks had not yet adopted inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policy.
Large inflation outbursts can occur even when central banks have a clear mandate and a strong commitment to achieving price stability.[2]
With the benefit of hindsight, the long period of low and stable inflation during the great moderation was the result not only of good policies but also of good luck, in the sense that the shocks hitting our economies were, on balance, disinflationary.[3]Today, this balance may have changed signs.
The change in the macroeconomic landscape is also reflected in financial markets. While inflation risk premia had become negative in the years before the pandemic, they started to rise already in the second half of 2020 and returned to positive territory in 2022 (Slide 2, left-hand side).
In the same vein, we have seen a shift in the Survey of Professional Forecasters. In the pre-pandemic period, the distribution of inflation expectations was skewed to the downside. In the high inflation period, the distribution shifted markedly to the right, showing a fat, right-hand tail. And then, as inflation slowed, it became more balanced (Slide 2, right-hand side).
So, within a few years, we may have moved from a regime of chronically low inflation to one where adverse supply-side shocks dominate – owing, for example, to the growing fragmentation of the global economy or climate change. This may give rise to upside risks, as some of the factors that had contributed to low inflation during the 2010s may now be working in the opposite direction.
Second, the level of the natural rate of interest, or r* – the real short-term rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary – has become more uncertain.[4]
Before the pandemic, a secular decline in productivity growth and an ageing society had put downward pressure on r*.[5]In recent years, however, the range of model-based estimates of the natural rate of interest has moved upwards in tandem with market-based measures (Slide 3, left-hand side).[6]
Whether real interest rates will ultimately be higher than during the 2010s depends critically on how our society addresses the structural challenges it is currently facing.
If firms and governments are serious about fighting climate change and making the euro area economy more competitive, private and public investments will need to rise measurably so that capital deepening and higher productivity growth offset the drag from an ageing society on potential output and real interest rates.
Given the global nature of r*, the future level of real rates will also depend on changes in the supply of savings and the demand for investments in the rest of the world. A global surge in investment in response to digitalisation, decarbonisation and deglobalisation would raise r*, while higher global uncertainty in an era of geopolitical shifts may have the opposite effect.
This uncertainty about the level of r* is reflected not only in the wide range of estimates across different models but also in the even larger parameter uncertainty within models (Slide 3, right-hand side).
The latter has recently increased notably. For example, according to the frequently used Holston-Laubach-Williams model, the 68% confidence interval for the estimate of the euro area’s current natural rate has a width of almost 12 percentage points around its point estimate.
Given this uncertainty, central banks need to be prepared for all scenarios.
Third, before the pandemic, a wide range of research suggested that the Phillips curve had flattened considerably, implying a weaker relationship between economic slack and inflation.[7]
Today, there is increasing evidence across major economies that the slope of the Phillips curve is highly state-dependent.[8]When marginal costs increase rapidly and threaten to erode profit margins, firms tend to raise their prices more frequently, as seen in past years (Slide 4, left-hand side).[9]
More recently, however, firms have started absorbing a substantial part of the increase in their marginal costs – mainly reflecting strong wage growth – in their profit margins, causing the frequency of price increases to slow measurably. This change in the pass-through of marginal costs to prices also reflects the success of monetary policy in restoring the balance between supply and demand.
Research has also shown that, beyond certain levels of labour market tightness, the relationship between inflation and economic slack can change (Slide 4, right-hand side).[10]In the United States, for example, the number of job vacancies exceeding the number of unemployed workers was accompanied by a rapid surge in inflation, resulting in a steepening of the Phillips curve.[11]
A state-contingent or non-linear Phillips curve implies that conditions can change quickly if a large shock hits the economy.
A reassessment of policy tools
All this suggests that the macroeconomic environment in which central banks are operating today has become more uncertain and more volatile. In a world more prone to shocks, the inflation regime can shift quickly, real equilibrium rates can move up or down and macroeconomic relationships like the Phillips curve can become highly unstable.
One key takeaway from this increase in volatility is that monetary policy needs to be more agile. It needs to be able to change course quickly when circumstances change.
However, not all policy tools are equally agile. The experience of the past few years suggests that some instruments can be unwound quickly, while others have more persistent effects on financial markets and the economy.
I see three lessons from the episodes of low and high inflation for central banks’ toolkits.
First, policy rates clearly pass the agility test.
The recent tightening cycle is a case in point. Raising policy rates quickly has proven highly effective in reigning in inflation by dampening the growth in aggregate demand and anchoring inflation expectations. This has helped dispel any doubts about central banks’ determination to fight inflation and fears of them being subject to fiscal dominance.[12]
Our approach to adjusting policy rates was in line with the outcome of our 2021 monetary policy strategy review, in which we confirmed that policy rates are our main policy instrument. Constraints on reacting swiftly are usually self-imposed in the form of forward guidance.
Being able to change course quickly also suggests that negative policy rates, which are more controversial, remain a useful policy instrument should we become constrained again by the zero lower bound.
While negative rates come with undisputable costs, they can be a powerful instrument for easing the policy stance when inflation is too low. Most notably, breaking the zero lower bound allows central banks to shift the entire distribution of the expected future interest rate path, thereby providing more policy accommodation when needed.[13]
And when the tide changes, this accommodation can be quickly removed, as it was in July 2022 when the ECB unwound negative rates in just one step, raising the deposit facility rate (DFR) from -0.5% to 0%.
Second, asset purchases need to be used more cautiously and selectively.
Asset purchases are a powerful tool for stabilising financial markets during periods of stress. When markets dry up as intermediaries pull back from market making, central banks can quickly provide liquidity and instil confidence, thereby restoring market functioning.
Stabilising financial markets typically requires only short-lived interventions. During the pandemic, for example, systemic stress in the euro area receded rapidly once the ECB started making purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) (Slide 5, left-hand side).
In particular, use of the PEPP’s flexibility, allowing – if necessary – for deviations from the ECB’s capital key, which serves as a benchmark for allocating government bond purchases in the euro area, turned out to be limited and transitory (Slide 5, right-hand side).
Similarly, during the liability-driven investment (LDI) crisis in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England purchased assets over just 13 trading days and began unwinding the portfolio six weeks later. Holdings were fully unwound after a few weeks without causing any market dysfunction.
Hence, asset purchases used for financial stability purposes also pass the agility test, if calibrated and communicated appropriately. Then, purchases can be limited in volume and unwound quickly, which also helps limit moral hazard. They therefore need to remain part and parcel of central banks’ toolkits.
This is particularly important in the euro area, which has been prone to fragmentation and has therefore introduced tools, such as the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), to ensure a smooth transmission across the entire euro area.
The assessment is less clear for asset purchases conducted for quantitative easing (QE) when central banks buy bonds to lower long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Experience shows that, in this case, purchasing volumes have to be considerable for central banks to compress the term premium to an extent that affects prices and activity.
For the euro area, for example, ECB staff estimate that between January 2015 and the end of 2018 purchases worth €2.6 trillion were needed to lower euro area five-year sovereign yields by only 0.8 percentage points.[14]
The past few years have demonstrated that such purchase volumes can come with significant costs.
One such cost is the constraint put on central banks when policy needs to change course.
Large bond holdings cannot be reversed quickly. If quantitative tightening proceeded at the same pace as quantitative easing, there would be the risk of absorption bottlenecks and a sharp rise in interest rates that could undo the effects on activity and inflation for which asset purchases were made in the first place. It could also disturb the smooth transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.
In other words, quantitative tightening (QT) imposes a certain gradualism on central banks, as asset holdings can be built up much faster than they can be shrunk.
This has several implications.
One is that it may entail losses for central banks.
When central banks need to raise interest rates in the pursuit of their price stability mandate, interest rate risk materialises, causing large losses on bond holdings. While these losses need to be viewed against the gains made during the purchasing phase, there can be a hit to credibility, even if central banks are not profit-maximising institutions. Depending on the accounting treatment, losses can materialise over a long period of time.
Another implication relates to the impact on the monetary policy stance. As bond holdings can be unwound only gradually, asset prices will remain distorted for a long time.
We saw this occur during the most recent tightening cycle. Term premia remain compressed and risk premia in many asset markets stand at the lower end of the historical distribution, potentially distorting risk-taking behaviour (Slide 6, left-hand side and middle).
For monetary policy, this could mean that central banks needed to raise policy rates more forcefully to compensate for the persistent effects of bond holdings on long-term interest rates. Indeed, scaled by the magnitude of rate hikes, the tightening in financial conditions seems to have been more muted than in previous episodes (Slide 6, right-hand side).
So, what does this imply for the use of QE in the future?
In short, it means that the bar for starting QE should be higher than in the past. There needs to be a clear threat to medium-term price stability for central banks to activate large-scale asset purchases.
In particular, we need to better understand to what extent an extended period of inflation that is moderately below target risks a de-anchoring of inflation expectations that could unleash a truly harmful deflationary spiral.
Downward price and wage rigidities imply that it probably requires a significant shock for low inflation to turn into outright deflation. This can be seen when looking at the pricing behaviour of firms.
Despite persistently low inflation during the 2010s, the share of industrial firms planning to reduce prices was limited and about the same as before the global financial crisis, and the net balance of selling price expectations remained positive on average (Slide 7, left-hand side).
Households, on balance, also did not expect deflation in the low inflation period following the global financial crisis, with the net balance of inflation expectations remaining positive throughout (Slide 7, right-hand side). At the peak, just 5% of households expected prices to fall during the 2010s.
Therefore, should monetary policy in the future be once again constrained by the effective lower bound, central banks would need to carefully assess whether the benefits of QE really outweigh the costs, which often only materialise after a considerable delay.
The ECB’s experience highlights that there are other tools, such as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), that are effective in stimulating bank lending and therefore growth, and can be unwound significantly faster (Slide 8).
The third lesson is that forward guidance must not excessively tie policymakers’ hands.
In the pre-pandemic years, explicit forward guidance signalling a “low-for-longer” policy was effective in providing additional stimulus when needed at the effective lower bound.[15]
But forward guidance is useful only when macroeconomic volatility is low – that is, when the risk of central banks having to renege on previous commitments is limited.
In a high-volatility world, by contrast, forward guidance almost mechanically implies that central banks either take the risk of falling behind the curve or take a course of action that is inconsistent with their previous guidance.[16]
Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, forward guidance, including on the sequencing of the use of policy tools, was arguably one reason why central banks initially reacted too slowly to emerging price pressures, before they changed course sharply.
As forward guidance acted as a credible coordination device for investors, the markets in December 2021 still expected rates to remain negative for the foreseeable future, despite the marked rise in inflation (Slide 9).
In today’s volatile environment, forward guidance is therefore of limited use to central banks. And even if conditions changed in the future, implying a return to a low-inflation, low-volatility world, central banks should only communicate about the likely future direction of monetary policy in a “Delphic” way, that is, conditional on how the economy evolves.
Importantly, the conditions should be formulated in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner to account for the uncertainty around the inflation and economic outlook.
Let me conclude.
In recent years, the macroeconomic landscape has become considerably more volatile. To effectively manage inflation in this environment, central banks need to prioritise agility and flexibility when choosing their instruments in the pursuit of their mandate.
Short-term interest rates therefore remain the instrument of choice in most circumstances.
Asset purchases have proven to be a powerful tool for market stabilisation, while their cost-benefit ratio is less favourable when it comes to stimulating the economy near the effective lower bound. QE should therefore be used more cautiously in the future. Other tools, such as TLTROs, have been effective in reviving bank lending and can be reversed more quickly.
Our recent experience has also taught us that central bankers should be careful not to tie their hands too much by providing explicit forward guidance. In a volatile macroeconomic environment, they should remain agile and retain the ability to change course quickly when circumstances change.
Thank you."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the annual ECB Conference on Money Markets
Frankfurt, 7 November 2024
Excess liquidity in the euro area has declined measurably over the past two years. It has fallen by more than a third relative to its peak in 2022, and it dropped below €3 trillion about a month ago.
This decline in excess liquidity predominantly resulted from banks repaying the loans they had taken under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). More recently, the phasing-out of reinvestments of bonds maturing under the Eurosystem’s monetary policy portfolios has increasingly contributed to the decline.
As of January 2025, the Eurosystem will no longer reinvest any of its monetary policy bond holdings, leading to a run-off in our portfolios of around €40 billion per month.
The ECB is closely monitoring the impact of the decline in excess liquidity on financial markets, the banking system and the economy at large to assess how these developments are affected by the changes to our operational framework that we announced earlier this year.
In my remarks, I would like to take stock of where we stand today. My main message is that, while excess liquidity is remaining ample, the ECB’s balance sheet reduction is progressing smoothly and has helped improve market functioning, with clear signs of increased market activity and a redistribution of reserves across banks and borders.
Supplying reserves on demand reduces uncertainty
Historical episodes of central banks reducing the size of their balance sheets, let alone by significant amounts, have been rare. For this reason, all major central banks are closely monitoring the transition from abundant to less ample excess liquidity.
For the ECB, staff projections suggest that, from a historical perspective, excess liquidity will remain ample for some time (Slide 2). However, there is significant uncertainty about banks’ ultimate liquidity preferences, as well as about the capacity of money markets to efficiently distribute excess liquidity across the euro area.[1]
If banks wished to hold a higher level of excess reserves, for instance due to stricter prudential regulation, the projected decline in excess liquidity might put upward pressure on money market rates earlier than suggested by historical regularities.
To cater for this uncertainty, the Governing Council in March decided on changes to the ECB’s operational framework for implementing monetary policy.[2]
The framework has three key characteristics (Slide 3).[3]
The first is that it is a demand-driven system, meaning that the marginal unit of reserves is provided elastically on demand through our standard refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.
A demand-driven system allows banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal and insures against risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. This requires banks to regard access to our standard refinancing operations as an integral part of their liquidity management, without any stigma attached, while retaining a diversified funding mix.
The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves.
Our short-term refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision. At a later stage, we will gradually complement them with new structural longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings. Both will provide a more stable source of liquidity to reflect the economy’s growing currency demand.
The third key characteristic is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.
As reserves become less ample, money market rates could rise relative to the deposit facility rate (DFR) – the rate through which we steer our monetary policy stance – and could potentially become too volatile. In view of this, on 18 September, the spread between the rate on the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the DFR was reduced from 50 basis points to 15 basis points.
This historically narrow spread limits both the scope for upward pressure on money market rates and their volatility, and it sets incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.
In this context, a “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR in both directions, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance.
At the same time, the reduced spread is still large enough to preserve incentives for banks to find market-based funding solutions to insure themselves against liquidity shocks, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation through the Eurosystem balance sheet.[4]
Balance sheet reduction progresses smoothly
Clarity on the operational framework has helped banks, and financial markets more broadly, prepare for a period with less ample reserves. Since we announced the changes to our framework in March, further significant balance sheet reduction has taken place.
This reduction has been progressing smoothly, and many of the concerns over the potential impact of the decline in our balance sheet on the economy have not materialised.
This is illustrated by three developments.
First, the phasing-out of reinvestments by the Eurosystem has not led to any bottlenecks in the absorption of bonds so far, in spite of increased net issuance by governments. Foreign investors have been absorbing the largest share of the net issuance of bonds in the euro area since the Eurosystem ended its reinvestment of securities under the asset purchase programme (APP), with households also playing an important role in some economies (Slide 4, left-hand side).[5]
Second, we have not seen an excessive rise in long-term interest rates. While the term premium initially increased from historically unprecedented negative territory, it has recently fallen again and stabilised at low levels (Slide 4, right-hand side).
The fact that the impact on the term premium has been contained reflects the gradual and transparent approach central banks have taken when reducing their balance sheets.
This gradualism is probably one reason why announcements of quantitative tightening are often found to have smaller effects on bond prices than announcements of quantitative easing.[6]Since bonds held by the central bank mature only gradually, investors may heavily discount redemptions that are due far out in the future.
Third, subdued credit growth over the past two years cannot be attributed to the reduction in excess liquidity, and in our monetary policy bond portfolios, in particular. Instead, it has been, by and large, the result of weak loan demand and higher interest rates.
According to our most recent bank lending survey, 95% of banks reported that the ECB's monetary policy asset portfolio had no impact on their lending volumes to firms over the past six months. 96% of banks expect this to remain the case over the next six months.
That is, banks do not mechanically make their lending decisions dependent on the level of excess liquidity, with base money “multiplying” into broad money.[7]
The decline in excess liquidity may even contribute to higher rather than lower credit growth. New evidence for the United States suggests that reserves injected during quantitative easing crowded out bank lending, possibly because regulation has made bank balance sheet capacity costly.[8]
The impact of falling excess liquidity on money markets
So, balance sheet reduction has not left any significant footprint in many areas, at least so far. But in other areas, especially in the euro area money market, the ongoing decline of excess liquidity is starting to leave some traces on activity and prices.
I would now like to explain what these traces are and what they imply for monetary policy and the likely future evolution of money market rates.
In a demand-driven system, gauging the ampleness of reserves is not necessary for informing the process of quantitative tightening, which is running steadily and predictably in the background.
The reason is that, in contrast to a supply-driven system, our framework does not require estimating the volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the steering rate. In the euro area, the narrow corridor ensures that overnight rates will remain close to the DFR.
But it matters for the implementation of our monetary policy how the decline in excess liquidity affects the take-up in our standard refinancing operations, how it shapes the distribution of reserve holdings across the euro area and how it influences the rates at which banks borrow in money markets.
We have therefore developed a comprehensive monitoring toolbox to allow us to understand how banks adapt to the decline in excess liquidity and whether this process may eventually require changes to our operational framework. A review of the key parameters of the operational framework is scheduled for 2026.[9]
Based on this analysis, I would like to discuss three developments that have emerged over the course of this year and that suggest that the changes to our framework have been effective in supporting market functioning, in reviving market activity and in implementing our policy stance.
The first development relates to a steady and measurable rise in secured money market rates in the euro area and beyond (Slide 5, left-hand side). While in some parts of the world repo rates are already trading above the main policy rate, or have temporarily drifted outside of the target range, in the euro area the repo funds rate is now trading broadly at the level of the DFR.
Within the euro area, repo rates have also converged across collateral classes (Slide 5, right-hand side). Over the past years, transactions secured by German government collateral, in particular, were trading at a significant premium over others. This premium has declined considerably.
The increase in repo rates could result from two factors: higher collateral availability and lower excess liquidity.[10]Depending on which factor dominates, the implications for monetary policy would differ.
One of the main conclusions of our monitoring work is that it was primarily the reversal of collateral scarcity that was driving repo rates higher.
Between 2021 and 2023, the ECB’s large bond holdings and the significant take-up in our TLTROs resulted in a sharp decline in the collateral available for secured lending.
Collateral scarcity, in turn, caused repo rates to drop sharply. At the peak, more than 70% of repos were trading at least 30 basis points below the DFR (Slide 6, left-hand side). Repos against German collateral temporarily traded more than 100 basis points below the DFR.
Collateral availability has improved significantly over the past 18 months.
Large issuance by euro area sovereigns, the Eurosystem’s reduced market footprint from the gradual run-down of the monetary policy bond portfolio and the return of collateral mobilised with the Eurosystem all contributed to easing the strains in repo markets and thus to the gradual normalisation of repo rates from extreme conditions (Slide 6, right-hand side).[11]
The question is whether the rise in repo rates will continue.
Any answer to this question is inherently speculative. But for as long as there is ample excess liquidity, it is likely that repo rates will stay in the vicinity of the DFR, as banks would be expected to lend reserves in the repo market if there were persistent gains to be made there as opposed to depositing these reserves with the ECB.
And, for now, the DFR is anchoring one-day repo rates, even for collateral of lower-rated sovereign bonds (Slide 7, left-hand side). This is because most Eurosystem counterparties still have excess liquidity several times larger than their minimum reserve requirements, especially the larger ones (Slide 7, right-hand side).
The extent to which markets can mitigate upward pressure on repo rates critically depends on market participants taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities arising from the spread between money market rates and the DFR.
This includes banks’ willingness to lend reserves across borders, as the distribution of excess liquidity holdings is highly uneven across countries and institutions (Slide 8, left-hand side).
So, on reporting dates, or at lower levels of excess liquidity, repo rates could rise above the DFR. This may happen, for example, if banks start to refrain from lending reserves in money markets, for instance to keep their regulatory liquidity ratios above a certain threshold.
Such intermediation constraints may help explain the premium that we are seeing today for repo transactions covering the year-end, even for the most liquid collateral (Slide 8, right-hand side). High price mark-ups often reflect trades with non-banks that have no access to our lending facilities.
This brings me to the second development.As excess liquidity has declined, we have seen a notable pick-up in market-based funding activity, which has also contributed to reserves circulating from banks with abundant liquidity to those with less liquidity.
Repo volumes of transactions between euro area counterparties have grown by nearly 25% since excess liquidity started to decline, with the strongest growth seen for cross-border transactions (Slide 9, left-hand side). With the repayment of the TLTROs, we have also seen a considerable rise in liquidity-motivated transactions, which now seem to have stabilised at a comparatively high level (Slide 9, right-hand side).
The issuance of bank bonds has also played an important role in providing market-based funding and in redistributing central bank reserves.[12]
Since 2022 banks have issued a record amount of covered and senior unsecured bonds to substitute maturing TLTRO funding, with several issuers returning to the market after a long absence (Slide 10, left-hand side). For covered bonds, last year saw a record number of issuers tapping this market, including a variety of small-sized issuers.
Banks were major investors in the covered bonds issued by other banks. From 2022 to mid-2024, banks absorbed the lion share of the net issuance of covered bonds (Slide 10, right-hand side).
Cross-border transactions played an important part in this, as banks with abundant liquidity invested in covered bonds of their peers located elsewhere (Slide 11, left-hand side).
These cross-border flows suggest that there are no signs of fragmentation. So does the fact that changes in TARGET2 balances, reflecting cross-border flows, have measurably contributed to recent changes in excess liquidity (Slide 11, right-hand side).
In Italy, for example, large TARGET2 inflows offset a significant part of the decline in excess liquidity related to the repayments of TLTRO III.[13]In reserve-rich countries, the opposite effect prevailed.
This smooth redistribution of reserves is another indication that Eurosystem excess liquidity remains ample, and it is likely to have reduced the need of banks to use the ECB's standard refinancing operations (Slide 12). Less than 1% of the peak of outstanding TLTROs was rolled over into MROs or the three-month longer-term refinancing operations.
Moreover, the take-up of our operations did not materially increase after we reduced the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR to 15 basis points.
One reason is that, in most cases, funding via market-based sources remains more attractive than the recourse to ECB operations, even with a narrower spread (Slide 13, left-hand side). Currently, borrowing from the ECB may be more economical only for some non-high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) collateral.
In addition, we are seeing that banks are willing to reduce the share of reserves in their holdings of HQLA. This share fell from a peak of 78% in late 2022 to 56% today (Slide 13, right-hand side). As the aggregate liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) has stabilised around 160% over the past two years, banks have started to substitute reserves for other HQLA.
Yet, as excess liquidity declines further, we expect more and more banks to tap our liquidity-providing operations, also because a substantial share of euro area banks – representing about 25% of minimum reserve requirements – are currently not active in repo markets.
While this may change, membership requirements for central clearing counterparties, such as size, credit rating and operational capacity, may currently make it difficult for smaller banks to obtain collateralised credit.[14]
Borrowing in the unsecured money market could, in principle, be an alternative for these banks, especially because sourcing liquidity via unsecured trades has become cheaper compared with secured trades in the repo market since the middle of last year.
While repo rates have trended upwards, €STR – the euro area’s benchmark rate representing banks’ overnight unsecured borrowing conditions – has barely budged (Slide 14).
The stickiness of €STR is the third development I would like to discuss today. What does it imply for monetary policy? And why is this stickiness not necessarily surprising?
The unsecured segment of the euro area money market is special in two respects.
First, banks are rarely on the lending side, mostly for regulatory reasons. The Basel III reforms treat secured lending preferentially, establishing repo as the preferred choice for banks’ short-term lending overall.
From a borrower’s perspective, too, secured borrowing is more attractive than unsecured as leverage ratio costs can be significantly mitigated by netting lending and borrowing through central counterparty (CCP) clearing in the secured market.
As a result, the unsecured market is primarily used by banks to intermediate deposits from non-banks without access to the ECB’s balance sheet. Since 2022, an average of around 85% of the volume of trades have had non-banks as a counterparty, especially money market funds.
Since this intermediation service carries the costs of balance sheet expansion through the leverage ratio, banks typically demand a spread relative to the DFR to compensate them for binding their balance sheet capacity.[15]
Second, trades in the unsecured money market are typically relationship-based. Around 80% of €STR trading volumes come from depositor-bank relationships that are active almost every day (Slide 15, left-hand side).
Relationship trading has important implications for the pricing of the trade. Specifically, banks impose higher intermediation fees on customers that come only sporadically and are less predictable.
Empirical evidence suggests that banks reduce the extent of regulatory cost pass-through to their most stable clients by 2.4 basis points for taking on unsecured deposits (Slide 15, right-hand side). Such discounts are economically significant and can, in part, be explained by banks’ ability to profit from cross-selling other, more lucrative business to their stable depositors.
So, the microstructure of the unsecured money market is consistent with a weak responsiveness of €STR to changes in excess liquidity.
The question is whether, and to what extent, this will change as excess liquidity declines further.
There are two sides to this.
On the one hand, as many smaller banks do not have access to the repo market, they may start competing for liquidity in the unsecured market once borrowing needs become more imminent. Increased competition could put upward pressure on €STR.
On the other hand, lenders in the unsecured market seem price-insensitive. As repo rates trade well above €STR, lenders should have an incentive to place their cash in the repo market. However, so far there has been little migration across the two segments.
This is predominantly because most lenders that are active in the unsecured market do not have access to repo markets (Slide 16, left-hand side). Moreover, those that have a more diversified liquidity management may find it difficult to lend excess cash in secured markets, which operate mainly in the morning hours (Slide 16, right-hand side).[16]
Money market funds, for example, allow redemption notices until 14:00 and need to preserve liquidity to meet any potential outflows until then.[17]Unsecured markets may thus be the only viable option for them to place liquidity in the afternoon.
This suggests that banks are likely to maintain some pricing power in this market, keeping the sensitivity of €STR to changes in excess liquidity more muted.
Overall, it is uncertain which channel will dominate. It is therefore too early to assess whether €STR is an appropriate indicator of reserve scarcity. Its resilience so far may simply suggest that reserves remain ample.
But should the gap between repo rates and €STR continue to widen as excess liquidity declines, it will be necessary to assess how this affects the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.
Conclusion
All in all, and with this I would like to conclude, our analysis suggests that excess liquidity remains ample in the euro area.
Recent upward pressure on rates in some segments of the money market reflects, by and large, a reduction in collateral scarcity, due to the increased bond issuance by governments and the reduced Eurosystem market footprint. The improved availability of collateral has helped to significantly improve market functioning in the euro area.
In addition, increasing market-based funding activity and growing signs of redistribution of reserves across banks and borders suggest that banks have started adapting to an environment with less ample reserves.
We expect this process to continue as excess liquidity declines further, with banks increasingly sourcing liquidity through our standard refinancing operations, as these constitute an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy in our operational framework.
Thank you."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Distinguished Speakers Seminar organised by the European Economics and Financial Centre, University of London
London, 6 November 2024
I am delighted to be here today at the European Economics and Financial Centre seminar, hosted by the University of London.[1]My comments today will focus on the economic developments in the euro area and the Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions taken in October. I will discuss our assessment of the outlook for the euro area economy and the current disconnect between growing real incomes and weak consumption growth. I will also share some reflections on the distributional implications of the recent inflation surge and what these mean for monetary policy. I will conclude by explaining the rationale for our recent decision to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction.
In the aftermath of the pandemic, inflation rose rapidly over the course of 2021 and 2022, peaking at 10.6% in October 2022. This inflation surge was predominantly driven by a sequence of large and overlapping supply shocks, including the dynamics of post-pandemic reopening, which put severe strain on global supply chains and Russia’s war against Ukraine that led to a further spike in energy prices. The Governing Council responded forcefully to the inflation surge, in particular by raising our policy rate by 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023.
Inflation has come down steadily from its peak. Headline inflation declined to 1.7% in September, its lowest level since April 2021 but picked again to 2.0% in October, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate (Chart 1). These gyrations notwithstanding, the recent inflation releases reinforce the signs that price pressures have weakened and that the disinflation process is well on track. This largely reflects an unwinding of the forces that led to strong increases in the prices of energy, food and goods. Falling energy prices continued to be the main downward force for inflation in October. Services inflation – which remains more persistent – remained unchanged at 3.9%. Non-energy industrial goods inflation, while increasing to 0.5% in October, has fallen back to its pre-pandemic average. As a result, core inflation remained unchanged at 2.7% in October, down from its peak of 5.7% in March 2023. Inflation is expected to rise further in the coming months, partly because the sharp declines in energy prices during 2023 will drop out of the annual rates. It is then projected to decline to the 2% target over the course of next year, as labour cost pressures ease and the past monetary policy tightening gradually feeds through to prices.
Based on an ongoing assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, the Governing Council decided to begin moderating the degree of policy restriction in June by cutting interest rates by 25 basis points. Since then, we have reduced the rate on the deposit facility – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – by a further 50 basis points to its current level of 3.25%.
Turning to the growth outlook, euro area GDP rose by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2024, up from 0.2% in the second quarter, possibly reflecting the buoyant summer tourism season and one-off factors such as the Olympics in France. But, after a mild recovery in the first half of 2024, the latest economic indicators continue to suggest a weakening in activity across countries and sectors. Industrial production has been particularly volatile over the summer and the more interest-sensitive manufacturing sector has contracted for the 19th consecutive month, though at a slightly slower pace than in September. The manufacturing output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) has remained well below 50 since August 2022, registering 45.9 this October. In the services sector, activity in August was probably supported by a strong summer tourism season. That sector is still expanding, but at a slower pace, with the PMI edging down to 51.2 in October from 52.9 in August. These latest readings signal a weaker near-term outlook than projected by ECB staff in September.
A key mechanism underpinning the growth outlook is the recovery in private consumption, supported by growth in households’ real incomes. As inflation has declined, households’ real disposable incomes have recovered. Private consumption growth, on the other hand, has slowed, and remains anaemic. As a result, the savings rate, which had declined sharply after the pandemic shock, has risen steadily since mid-2022, and reached 15.7% in the second quarter of this year, significantly above the pre-pandemic average of 12.9% (Chart 2). This raises the question of why household consumption growth in the euro area has remained so weak. Why are households saving larger proportions of their incomes? And what does this mean for the growth outlook?
The recent increase in the savings rate can be attributed to several factors. First, as I have already discussed, both high inflation and rising interest rates in response to the inflation surge may have eroded real net wealth. Over the past two years, real net wealth has declined by 4%. This may have encouraged saving to recuperate past losses. Second, higher real returns on savings and a higher cost of borrowing may have increased incentives to postpone consumption and reduce new borrowing. Third, non-labour income, such as self-employment remuneration, net interest receipts, dividends and rents has grown by 4.1% over the past two years. But the propensity to save out of those sources of income is much higher than for, say, wages, because non-labour income typically accrues to wealthier households that have a low marginal propensity to consume. Indeed, the data tell us that the savings rate is higher among households in the top income quintile. Fourth, inertia or persistence in consumption and savings habits is also likely to create a lag in the way consumption responds to rising incomes. Finally, the concept of permanent income can also be an important determinant of consumer spending. Households may limit their spending if they fear that their permanent income, expected over their lifetime, has not increased by as much as their current disposable income today. Fiscal policy also plays a role here. Consumers may save more if they expect taxes to rise to service higher public debt in the future – in the spirit of the so-called Ricardian equivalence.
So, what does this mean for the current state of the economy? Is there a disconnect between growing real incomes and weak consumption growth?
The key determinants of high savings are expected to persist, though likely to a lesser extent, over the course of next year. In particular, the drive to recover net wealth and the slow adjustment in consumption should become less relevant as factors holding back higher spending dissipate. Indeed, survey evidence points to a gradual recovery in household spending, with retail sales edging up in August and the European Commission's consumer confidence indicator rising in September. Price and wage adjustments should also play a powerful role in reviving consumption. Over the past three years, the slowdown in consumption growth has been primarily due to a drop in purchases of non-durable goods like food and energy, which have been most affected by the rising prices. However, with food and energy inflation moderating and purchasing power increasing, spending should start to respond. And there are already indications that the consumption of goods increased over the summer, with a small uptick in retail trade in August.
Overall, this evidence suggests that private consumption growth will pick up, supported by ongoing robust growth in real labour income, lower inflation and improving consumer confidence. This expectation is also consistent with our September 2024 projections, which indicate that, as incomes continue to rise, inflation moderates and confidence strengthens, consumption will grow, albeit with savings remaining above pre-pandemic levels. Notwithstanding the near-term headwinds, the overall conditions for a pick-up in growth remain in place. The gradually fading-out of the effects of restrictive monetary policy should support both consumption and investment, and exports should contribute to the recovery as global demand rises.
This brings me on to monetary policy transmission, a key element of our reaction function. One important factor affecting transmission of monetary policy to inflation and growth relates to the distribution of income and wealth across households. Inflation surges, along with the response of monetary policy, can have significant distributional effects.[2]This matters for central banks because both the distribution and sources of income and wealth influence households’ consumption and savings decisions, and ultimately, inflation.
Inflation is often said to be a tax on the poor, especially when wages do not keep up with prices.[3]To the extent that inflation often goes hand-in-hand with rising food and energy prices, for example, it disproportionately affects poorer households because these items make up a larger share of their consumption basket. According to the most recent Eurostat Income, Consumption and Wealth experimental statistics, energy and food items together make up around 30% of the disposable income of households in the lowest income quintile, compared to 12% for the highest quintile.[4]And poorer households typically have lower savings buffers to be able to withstand a temporary erosion of their real purchasing power.
However, inflation can also act as a transfer of resources from net savers to net borrowers, partly because it lowers the real value of debt. This potentially reduces wealth inequality. As such, the composition of assets and liabilities influences how inflation surges, such as those observed recently, affect household wealth across the distribution. In particular, on the face of it, unanticipated inflation appears to reduce wealth inequality by redistributing wealth from lenders to borrowers through changes in the real value of assets and liabilities – a mechanism known as the Fisher channel.[5]This channel is strongest when incomes adjust to inflation, reducing the payment burdens falling on indebted households, who are usually in the lower half of the wealth distribution (Chart 3).
At the same time, changes in real interest rates have different valuation effects on different types of assets and liabilities. The Fisher channel weakens when unexpected inflation reduces the real interest income of low and medium-income households, who often hold their wealth in bank deposits, and increases the profit income of high-income households, who often also have wealth invested in stock markets.[6]These different wealth channels are important as they influence the transmission of monetary policy to aggregate consumption and spending, and ultimately to inflation. Wealthier households typically have a lower marginal propensity to consume and carry less debt, making them less sensitive to interest rate changes.
The newly developed Distributional Wealth Accounts (DWA) are experimental statistics that can be used to analyse the distributional effects of inflation and monetary policy in the euro area. A recent study, published in the ECB’s Economic Bulletin, shows that around 80% of financial securities – such as equities, investment fund shares and bonds – are held by the top 10% of wealthiest households, while the bottom 50% hold a greater proportion of their wealth in bank deposits and housing, though the latter is often financed by mortgage debt (Chart 3).[7]
To assess the impact of inflation on the distribution of wealth, changes in real net wealth can be decomposed into contributions from transactions, real asset revaluations, and erosion due to inflation.[8]Since mid-2021, real net wealth has declined across all wealth groups, but higher inflation has mitigated losses for poorer households by reducing the real value of their liabilities by more than their assets. Conversely, wealthier households have seen losses amplified by their larger nominal asset holdings. This wealth redistribution from savers to borrowers occurs mechanically through balance sheet positions but does not account for other factors such as interest income flows and debt repayments. Wealthier households have experienced larger real losses primarily due to the revaluation of financial assets like shares and bonds amid rising interest rates, even though they saved more and faced less dramatic declines in real house prices than poorer households.
By aiming to keep inflation close to target, monetary policy can help to mitigate these distributional effects. But monetary policy itself can affect the distribution of income and wealth through several, often offsetting, channels. The primary channels are changes in asset prices and the differing effects of interest rates on savings versus debt costs. Empirical evidence suggests that monetary policy tightening reduces net wealth across the wealth distribution.[9]The bottom 50% of households are mainly affected through housing wealth, while the top 10% feel more of an impact through financial wealth. Despite larger initial losses, the wealthiest tend to recover more quickly due to faster rebounds in equity prices compared with house prices.[10]Rising interest rates are also likely to be more challenging for poorer, more indebted households, as they increase the interest burden of debt. And because poorer households tend to have lower cash buffers and are less able to access lines of credit, if needed, it may be harder for them to cope with these rising financing costs. This is then also likely to weigh on their consumption via a debt overhang channel.[11]
The forceful monetary policy response has helped limit the direct effects of surging inflation on poorer households. At the same time, our monetary policy tightening may have eroded net wealth across the spectrum while also having important distributional consequences, with implications for the economic outlook as we continue to battle inflation.
The decision in October to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – by 25 basis points was based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. The inflation outlook is also affected by recent downside surprises indicators of economic activity, while financing conditions remain restrictive. Fine-tuning monetary policy decisions is complex but the medium-term orientation of inflation is clear.
Our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, without pre-committing to a particular rate path."

Welcome address by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the tenth anniversary of the Single Supervisory Mechanism
Frankfurt am Main, 6 November 2024
It is a pleasure to welcome you to this event celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
The SSM became operational ten years ago, almost to the day, on 4 November 2014. It was the most significant step forward in European integration since the introduction of the euro.
If we think back to how the banking sector was faring a decade ago, we can see just how much has changed. The euro crisis had exposed significant weaknesses: low equity buffers, high levels of non-performing loans and deep exposures to domestic sovereigns. Our challenge, as Danièle Nouy said at the time, was to “help rebuild confidence in the balance sheets of SSM area banks” amid a fragmented supervisory landscape.[1]
Today, however, the situation is vastly different. Despite the major shocks that have hit the euro area in recent years, our banking sector is resilient.
The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio rose from 12.7% in 2015 to 15.8% in mid-2024, while the liquidity coverage ratio increased from 138% to 159% over the same period.
The main risks we face today no longer stem from the banks themselves, but from an increasingly volatile external environment. And single supervision allows us to address these risks through a common, forward-looking approach.
So, have we achieved the initial aims of this single supervision?
The achievements of single supervision
If we consider the tumultuous events of the past few years, it is clear that European supervision has exceeded expectations. European banks have become considerably more resilient, providing critical stabilisation during the recent periods of disruption.
In essence, European supervision has successfully addressed what Herman Van Rompuy identified in 2012 as the need to “correct the weakness of the policy infrastructure of the common currency”.[2]
First, more rigorous and more uniform supervision has bolstered public confidence, ensuring that bank deposits are seen as equally safe across the euro area, thereby preserving the integrity of our monetary union. Since the start of single supervision, household’s cross-border deposits have more than doubled to €151 billion today.[3]
Second, sound banks have ensured that major shocks have not disrupted the effectiveness of monetary policy. Both when we eased policy to avert deflation during the pandemic and when we raised rates rapidly to combat inflation after the pandemic, the banks enabled our policy impulses to be transmitted smoothly across the euro area.
But we must also recognise that these stability-oriented goals, which arose from the conditions that led to the banking union agenda, are not ends in themselves. They are merely the foundation.
Our ultimate aim is for banks to be sound and for the policy framework to be complete, so that they can safely tap into resources from across the euro area and use them to fund innovation, investment and growth.
And it is on this particular objective that Europe is falling short in the transformative era we are living in today.
We are facing a quadruple challenge: decarbonisation, deglobalisation, digitalisation and decoupling. These forces are putting our competitiveness and strategic autonomy to the test.
To emerge stronger, we need massive investment in both physical and human capital. In the EU, an additional €5.4 trillion will be needed between 2025 and 2031 to advance the green transformation, accelerate the digitalisation of our economy and bolster our military defence capabilities.[4]
I have argued previously, and will continue to argue, that deepening Europe’s capital markets will be essential for this monumental task.[5]But this is no threat to banks, as they have a vital role to play, too.
The benefits of truly European banks
There are two main ways we can make sure banks contribute.
First, we can strengthen banks’ intermediation capacity by building a more integrated banking sector.
Currently, only two banks incorporated in the euro area rank among the ten largest banks in the world, holding the eighth and tenth positions.[6]Moreover, on average, the cross-border exposure of euro area banks is more than one-third higher outside the euro area than within it.[7]This fragmentation makes it more difficult for our banks to serve the European economy effectively. And the obstacles to cross-border banking are substantial.
Therefore, we need to create a single jurisdiction for banks – one that is essentially “country blind” in terms of its regulatory, supervisory and crisis management frameworks. For example, reducing the ring-fencing of capital and liquidity along national lines would allow funds to flow freely within banking groups and facilitate lending across borders. Only then would we be able to harness the benefits of genuine European banking groups in funding the upcoming transformations.
And those benefits are substantial. Truly European banks can effectively diversify their risks across sectors and regions. They have the capacity to lend more at scale and thus handle cross-border financing projects that smaller locally focused banks cannot.
More integrated banks can also play a pivotal role as key capital market makers. This brings me to the second way in which banks can help to improve Europe’s financing capacity.
More integrated banks have the critical mass to attract companies across the euro area for stock market listings, debt securities placements, private equity transactions, mergers and acquisitions, and support for international growth.
Moreover, progress in establishing a genuine capital markets union can help to remove the differences in national regulatory frameworks that currently hinder cross-border bank activity, paving the way for a sufficiently large securitisation market. Banks would then be able to transfer risk to investors and unlock additional lending.
To put this into perspective, banks in the United States currently benefit from a securitisation market that is three times the size of Europe’s. Even without a state-sponsored framework, safely expanding our own market could unlock tremendous potential within our bank-based financial system.
And robust supervisory standards would be key to ensuring that the risks tied to securitisation are managed effectively.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
A decade ago, we embarked on a journey to establish European supervision to address the vulnerabilities exposed by the financial crisis and complete our monetary union. It was a bold step, born out of necessity and vision.
Ten years later, it is clear that European banking supervision has not only met, but exceeded, our expectations.
The achievements we are celebrating today are the result of our joint efforts. Many of you have played a pivotal role in this success, and I want to express my deep gratitude for your unwavering commitment and tireless energy.
As we look ahead to the next decade, we must harness this same determination and energy. Our aim is clear: to ensure that European banks are in an even better position to fund the economy. This means creating the conditions for a genuine single banking market – one that allows us to leverage the combined financing power of our banking system to overcome the challenges Europe is facing.
As Benjamin Franklin wisely said, “Energy and persistence conquer all things”. We currently need both – and you have both in spades. Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at an event to mark the 15th anniversary of the Autorité de la concurrence
Paris, 5 November 2024
It is truly a pleasure to be back here today to celebrate the 15th anniversary of theAutorité de la concurrence.
Competition policy in Europe has always played an important role in ensuring the functioning of our Economic and Monetary Union. The main objective of competition policy has been to preserve competition within Member States and within the Single Market.
At the political level, these policy objectives were sometimes challenged, as they were seen as an obstacle to the goal of creating national champions in some sectors.
This apparent contradiction has now been aggravated by profound changes in the global economic and political landscape.
New technologies are transforming markets, new competitors are emerging globally, and governments are facing a new set of priorities, including louder calls for state aid and industrial policy.
As a result, some argue that the supposed trade-off between competition and competitiveness is becoming more accentuated – in the sense that competition policy is limiting EU companies’ ability to compete against larger, in many cases state-backed, global rivals.
In my view, this trade-off is not inherent. We should avoid walking backwards into the future.
With a careful approach, Europe can preserve the benefits of competition while adapting to the changing world we are facing.
So, in these remarks, I would like to recall why competition is vital to our economies and the new challenges facing competition policy today.
I will then offer three key principles that can help us navigate this environment without sacrificing our competitive framework. These areconsistency,complementarityandcompetence.
The benefits of a strong competition framework
There are well-founded reasons for strong competition policy and enforcement. Let me briefly mention three.
First, competition has positive effects on growth.
It leads to resources being reallocated to the most productive firms more effectively, managers running their businesses more efficiently, and greater innovation and investment.
As a result, a recent review by the European Commission finds clear and consistent evidence that industries which experience greater competition also experience stronger productivity growth, and that weaker competition undermines productivity growth.[1]
Second, competition leads to lower and less volatile prices.[2]
It not only prevents firms from charging excessive markups, but also ensures that companies quickly re-optimise production after cost shocks, keeping inflation subdued.
In France, for example, products subject to online competition displayed lower inflation during the period from 2009 to 2018.[3]The difference in inflation between a basket of supermarket products sold only offline and those same products also sold online was 2 percentage points.
Third, competition makes the economy more sensitive to interest rates, which supports macroeconomic management by the central bank and the transmission of monetary policy.
When markets are competitive, firms typically have lower profits and cash reserves. As a result, they are less able to fund investments internally and need to look outside for finance. This exposure to external financing makes them more sensitive to changes in interest rates by the central bank.
ECB research finds that the lower the concentration of the market in which firms operate, the greater the impact of monetary policy changes on those firms.[4]Conversely, a concentration of market power is found to reduce the responsiveness of the economy to interest rate changes.
So, as competition improves productivity, lowers inflation and strengthens policy transmission, it should be no surprise that the ECB has always supported a robust competition framework.
Since the start of the euro, there has been a relatively stable consensus in Europe about the approach to competition. This approach was built around implementing the Single Market, strong antitrust enforcement and a strict approach towards state aid. And, by and large, it was a success.
Single Market integration did not prevent markups from rising in Europe, but they remained well below the levels seen in the United States.[5]
The instances of extreme market concentration in the United States – in terms of firms and sectors – were far less of an issue in Europe.[6]
And state aid was controlled, averaging just 0.7% of EU GDP each year between 2000 and 2019.[7]
Overall, the system of shared competence – with the Commission and national authorities jointly enforcing EU law – was effective. In fact, 90% of all competition decisions taken under EU law are taken by national authorities.
New challenges for competition policy
But in recent times, we have seen increasing tension between the internal and external dimensions of competition.
With the United States being the home of tech giants and China producing at astonishing scale, the question is whether Europe needs to change its competition policy to compete globally.
In some sectors, like telecoms, there are proposals to redefine the relevant market to encourage larger European players that can invest more and match their international rivals.[8]
In other sectors, like tech, the Commission is being encouraged to give greater consideration to “innovation criteria” when considering mergers to facilitate large investments.
And in the defence and space sectors, for example, there are calls to give more weight to “resilience criteria” as geopolitical dependencies are at stake.[9]
This shift is also being reflected in a new attitude towards industrial policy and state aid.
In 2022, almost 1.5% of EU GDP was spent on state aid – more than double the pre-pandemic average. 65% of this spending took place in the three largest EU countries.[10]Much of this aid was related to the pandemic and theenergy crisis. But there is also a clear trend among governments to provide more funding to “strategic” industries such as chips and batteries.
We cannot wish these changes away. We are facing a new global landscape.
But we must also be clear that, if we prioritise fending off external competition over preserving internal competition, it will mean sacrificing other goals that matter to us today.
It is now widely understood that Europe needs to boost its lagging productivity growth, and that a key driver of our weak productivity is a static industrial structure. Unlike in the United States, the same “middle tech” companies dominate R&D spending year after year, while too few innovative companies rise up in high tech sectors.[11]There is also broad agreement that the best way to facilitate the scaling-up of young firms is to complete the Single Market.
Allowing more state aid or industry consolidation might seem attractive to protect the competitive position of incumbent companies. But if the price we pay is a more fragmented Single Market or new entry barriers for young firms, we will end up losing more than we gain.
So, the key challenge for Europe will be to construct a framework through which we can deliver on governments’ new policy goals without sacrificing the benefits of competition.
Key principles to move forward
In my view, three principles will be key for success:consistency,complementarityandcompetence.
First, we need consistency in how we assess competition and deliver state support.
An unfortunate trend we are seeing today is the fragmentation of competition law at the national level, especially in new markets, like digital markets. Some countries are attempting to enforce their own rulebooks for large digital companies or adding national rules to EU legislation.
The singleness of EU competition law is what binds our whole competition framework together, so this trend must be stamped out to preserve the level playing field.
Likewise, if we are entering a world in which we systematically allow more state support for companies, it must be done, as much as possible, in a European way.
The optimal level for action is the EU budget, and I am encouraged by the Commission’s intention to refocus the next Multiannual Financial Framework on competitiveness and simplify access to EU financing. But I also recognise the limitations here. We need to reflect deeply on how we can embed European principles in state aid policy when it remains largely a national concern.
Second, industrial and competition policies must be seen as complements, not substitutes.
From the competition side, there is no inherent trade-off with industrial policy if competition authorities take into account innovation, resilience and sustainability in their decisions – which they can already do within the existing EU rules.
And from the industrial policy side, interventions can be designed in an innovation-focused way that is pro-competition – not to protect national champions or “pick winners”.[12]
As Philippe Aghion, Jean Tirole and Mathias Dewatripont recently argued, the mRNA vaccines introduced during the pandemic are a good example of how this approach can work.[13]
When COVID-19 emerged, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority concentrated its funding on three technologies, with two projects per technology. The authorities did not pretend to know which technologies would work and offered no incumbency advantage.
While all six projects ended up being approved, the two main winners, the US firm Moderna and the German firm BioNTech, were actually small biotechs. This experience provides a useful model for Europe for how to combine state-led goals with innovation and competition.
The third principle is competence, by which I mean both assigning responsibility appropriately and drawing on the best available expertise.
Specifically, competition authorities must remain in the driving seat in determining the appropriate level of concentration in different types of markets.
There may be circumstances where allowing consolidation is justified to achieve wider policy goals. For example, economists in the Schumpeterian tradition have suggested that, to promote innovation, there is an optimal intermediate level of competition that balances some market power – creating a surplus for firms to invest in R&D – and competition to leave room for new entrants.[14]
But it is difficult to judge where different sectors lie on this curve. Studies find opposing results on the impact of mergers on innovation activity, driven by factors like differences in market structure and the reduction in the number of competitors.[15]
So careful analysis, carried out on a case-by-case basis by experts with deep understanding, will be essential. Competition policy is a field where both lawyers and economists will have to closely interact.
Conclusion
On that positive note, let me conclude.
Competition policy is entering a new phase, with internal and external forces pulling in different directions. Should this lead to less competition, it would be bad for Europe. But I believe there is a path ahead that will allow us to achieve our wider policy goals in a way that is pro-competition.
We will only be able to take this path if we refuse to accept false trade-offs, and if competition authorities remain at the heart of the process.
As Frédéric Bastiat said, “Détruire la concurrence, c’est tuer l’intelligence”. Fortunately, theAutoritéwill be here for many years to come, keeping us on our toes."

Frankfurt am Main, 4 November 2024
Introduction
Thank you for your kind invitation. It’s a pleasure to be with you this afternoon to reflect on the first decade of European banking supervision and, most importantly, to take a look at the path ahead of us.
On this day ten years ago, the morning might have seemed just like a typical November morning in Frankfurt’s Bankenviertel: a rainy autumn day, with people heading to their offices armed with umbrellas, wearing heavy coats.
But that day ten years ago was anything but typical.
Because it was the first time European supervisory teams got together and started work on an important task: making sure the banking system is safe and sound on behalf of European citizens.
At the time, some argued that integrating a fragmented system of supervision was either impossible or would take forever. Well, those pioneer European supervisors who came together on 4 November 2014 have certainly proven the sceptics wrong.
We have come a long way since that day. The last ten years have been transformative both for the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the banks we supervise. We have evolved from a start-up to a mature, risk-based and effective supervisor. Banks under our supervision have also evolved significantly, building up remarkable resilience. Unlike in the crises that predated the banking union, banks have now become part of the solution to economic shocks rather than the source. That’s good news.
There is, however, no room for complacency.
While past achievements provide a solid foundation, they are by no means a guarantee of future success. The macro-financial environment is changing profoundly. Unlike ten years ago, when the main risks emanated from banks themselves, today prudential risks are largely driven by an increasingly volatile and uncertain external environment.
In my remarks, I will therefore focus on how supervisors and banks must adapt to this challenging environment. I will also address suggestions being put forward by some to relax banking regulation and supervision – suggestions which in my view are misguided. Compromising the resilience that has been carefully built up over the past ten years would undermine the objective of having a financial system that can support a competitive and sustainable economy.
The first decade of European supervision: from start-up to maturity
But before focusing on current challenges, I hope you’ll allow me to take a brief walk down memory lane. Where did we start from? What were the expectations a decade ago? And how did we go about meeting them?
As Europe was looking into the abyss of the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2012, legislators agreed on nothing less than a paradigm shift – the banking union, which represented the most significant leap forward in European integration since the introduction of the euro.
The banking union encompasses three pillars, each with a straightforward task: first, European banking supervision to ensure that banks across Europe are subject to the same rules and high-quality supervisory standards. Second, European resolution to make sure that if banks fail, they can get resolved in an orderly manner instead of relying on the public purse. And third, European deposit insurance, to make sure that when push comes to shove, all depositors enjoy the same protection, no matter where in the euro area they are based.
As far as the supervisory pillar is concerned, the ECB and the national competent authorities that make up the SSM were given a clear mission: ensuring the safety and soundness of banks. This is not just an end in itself – it is necessary so that banks remain at the service of people and businesses by funding innovation, productivity and sustainable growth.
The destination was clear. But we had no roadmap to show us how to get there. There was no blueprint on how to transform a fragmented system of supervision into an integrated one. So it was by no means a given that the SSM would be a success.
In the start-up phase of the SSM we were essentially crossing the bridge we were still building: we spent the mornings recruiting the best risk experts from across Europe, the afternoons supervising significant banks, and the evenings setting up our processes.
When we started, there were plenty of ways in which supervisors across Europe looked at risks and how best to mitigate them. They all focused on different things: while some put the emphasis on credit file reviews, others focused on scrutinising banks’ internal risk management through the lens of the internal capital adequacy assessment process. Some supervisors chose to shine the spotlight more closely on governance or on-site culture.
Thanks to the unwavering commitment and tireless energy of supervisors from the national competent authorities and the ECB, we consolidated the best practices from this wealth of supervisory experience into a common supervisory approach. What followed was a race to the top rather than to the bottom, resulting in high-quality supervision and a level playing field.
On our path to becoming a mature organisation, we have adapted our processes along the way. Our supervision has evolved from being predominantly rule-based and heavily codified, to having a more flexible, agile and risk-focused approach.
And banks under our supervision have also evolved significantly over the past ten years. Today, European banks are in much better shape than a decade ago.
For instance, the financial resilience of SSM banks has notably improved. The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio has increased from 12.7% in 2015 to 15.8% today, the liquidity coverage ratio has increased from 138% in 2016 to 159% today and the non-performing loan ratio of significant banks has declined from 7.5% in 2015 to 1.9% today.[1]
Moreover, risk management, the effectiveness of internal control functions and governance arrangements in SSM banks have all improved.
Over the past ten years, banks under European supervision have shown remarkable resilience even under the most challenging circumstances. They have evolved from shock propagators to shock absorbers, stabilising rather than de-stabilising the economy as it experienced significant shocks such as the pandemic, Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the rapid changes to the interest rate environment. This resilience is also a testament to the crucial role played by European supervision, confirming that the SSM has lived up to the expectations that were placed on it a decade ago.[2]
Highly complex, volatile and challenging risk landscape
But there is no room for complacency. We can’t assume that the achievements of the past ten years will automatically pave the way for another successful decade of resilient banks under European supervision.
We can’t ignore the fact that the world around us is changing. The macro-financial environment is characterised by unprecedented shocks, giving rise to new risk drivers. In the words of President Lagarde, in the last three years alone we have “faced the worst pandemic since the 1920s, the worst conflict in Europe since the 1940s and the worst energy shock since the 1970s”.[3]
And as former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers put it, “this is the most complex, disparate and cross-cutting set of challenges that I can remember in the 40 years that I have been paying attention to such things’’.[4]
In fact, the current combination of risks, challenges and uncertainties is staggering.
A widening geopolitical divide and a global economy that is fragmenting into competing, increasingly protectionist blocs, give rise to new geopolitical risks.
Heightened operational headwinds such as ever-more sophisticated cyberattacks and technology disruptions are challenging banks’ operational resilience.
And last, but, alas, not least, we see the climate and nature crises unfolding, as evidenced by the horrific events last week in Paiporta and other villages and towns in the Spanish region of Valencia. On top of the human tragedy and physical destruction, the climate and nature crises are increasingly leading to material risks for banks.
What makes this period so unprecedented is that these challenges are not happening one after the other – they are all happening at the same time. And there is no clear sign of them going away any time soon, rather the contrary.
So how can supervisors and banks adjust to this era of polycrises?
Ensuring bank resilience in the era of polycrises
First and foremost, banks’ management bodies are the ones holding the steering wheel and must ensure that banks remain resilient and prepared for this new risk landscape. This involves making sure that banks have sound risk management that is commensurate to new risk drivers, that they maintain sufficient capital headroom to cushion against credible adverse scenarios, and that banks’ management bodies are effective in their steering and oversight function.
While acknowledging that banks’ management bodies are in the driving seat, as supervisors we keep a close eye to ensure that no material risks are left unaddressed.[5]This means that we must be able to identify the risks and then ensure that banks are resilient to these risks.
To ensure that our risk identification can keep up with the changing risk landscape, we have made our supervisory processes more agile. We simply cannot look at every risk with the same intensity, every year, in every bank we supervise. We have therefore started to implement a supervisory risk tolerance framework aiming at freeing up the desks and minds of supervisors. This allows our supervisors to focus on those risks that are most pertinent and the supervisory actions that are most impactful. In the same vein, we have also reformed our Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) to make it more targeted and risk-based. Moreover, we are increasingly using supervisory technology tools – also known as suptech – to detect risks early on and move closer to real-time supervision.[6]
These improvements to our processes give our supervisory teams more time to focus on the most relevant risks. By detecting vulnerabilities that would otherwise only surface later, we help banks to be better prepared and build up resilience proactively.
Let me illustrate this with an example. Threats from cyberattacks are on the increase and are challenging banks’ operational resilience. In 2022, 50% of our supervised entities were subject to at least one successful attack – that number rose to 68% in just one year.[7]In order to help banks better identify their vulnerabilities to cyber risks and bolster their operational resilience, earlier this year we conducted acyber resilience stress test[8]to gauge how well banks would be able to respond to and recover from a successful cyberattack while maintaining their critical functions and services. The cyber resilience stress test was an important learning exercise for banks; it helped them pinpoint areas where they need to build greater operational resilience to cyberattacks, which are unlikely to fade away in the current geopolitical risk environment.
Let’s shift our focus from risk identification to remediation. As supervisors we must ensure that the risks we identify in our risk assessments are adequately managed. This also means that if we find deficiencies in the way banks are managing their risks, they must be remediated fully and in a timely manner, not at some unspecified point in the distant future. This is why we are putting more emphasis on impact and effectiveness.[9]
To ensure full and timely remediation of our supervisory findings, we set out a time-bound remediation path. If a bank is not remedying the deficiency at a speed that will ensure full and timely remediation by the pre-established timeline, we will step up our supervisory action by deploying more intrusive measures from our ample supervisory toolkit. This is what we call the “escalation ladder”.
The use of supervisory powers to compel banks to make concrete improvements is not just something we do within the SSM; it is international best practice.[10]The disorderly events of the March 2023 banking turmoil were a clear reminder of what can happen when banks leave material shortcomings unaddressed for too long.
Banks and supervisors need to have the capacity to focus on emerging challenges. That’s why it is important to declutter our desks by tackling supervisory findings that have been with us for too long. While this is always an imperative, it is especially pertinent in the current challenging risk landscape.
Let me illustrate this with the example of risk data aggregation and reporting. It is very hard to imagine any bank being able to appropriately manage its risks without strong risk data reporting. A bank’s ability to manage and aggregate risk-related data effectively is a pre-requisite for sound decision-making and robust risk governance. In fact, the Capital Requirements Directive, as transposed into national law, requires banks to put processes in place to identify all material risks. Worryingly, risk data aggregation and reporting was the lowest-scoring sub-category of internal governance in the 2023 SREP. In other words, despite the work done by supervisors over the years, too many banks still don’t have adequate risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities.
It should not be a surprise that ECB Banking Supervision is stepping up the escalation ladder, using more intrusive supervisory tools to ensure that banks have adequate risk data aggregation capabilities. It’s not about forcing banks to do something that is merely an added perk; it’s about making sure they are able to manage material risks adequately and in good time. In a rapidly changing risk environment where prompt availability of reliable data has become essential, timely remediation of our supervisory findings on risk data aggregation is more important than ever.
Deregulation and lenient supervision would compromise resilience
After a decade of European supervision, it is not only the external risk environment that has changed. The current debate suggests that the perception by some of the role of financial regulation and supervision is also changing.
Ten years ago, with the gloomy memories of the global financial crisis lingering in people’s minds, there was a strong consensus across society on the need for strong financial regulation and supervision in order to safeguard the public good of financial stability.
Today, it appears that the pendulum is slowly swinging in the opposite direction. Some have raised the question as to whether regulation and supervision have become too conservative, to the point that they may constrain growth.
Let me be clear: the argument being put forward in favour of relaxing banking regulation and supervision in order to promote growth is misguided.[11]
We can’t allow the memory of the global financial crisis to fade. Its lessons are as relevant today as they were back in 2012, when the banking union was created. As deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods, correctly said, the great financial crisis was “the biggest growth-destroying event in recent economic history”.[12]The crisis was a stark reminder of the economic, social and fiscal hardship that weakly regulated and supervised banks can cause for people. The last thing we should do is ignore the lessons of the financial crisis and allow a regulatory race to the bottom, which would compromise the resilience that has been carefully built up over the last decade.
It is a fundamental misconception to frame safety and competitiveness as opposing forces.
It is essential to remember that resilient and well-capitalised banks are a pre-condition for competitiveness and sustainable growth.
Strong and resilient banks are best equipped to lend to the real economy, funding innovation, investment and growth, even during economic downturns.[13]Banking deregulation or more lenient supervision would weaken the foundations of growth.
It is true that European growth has been sluggish when compared with other regions, and addressing it is rightly a top priority. That is why we need policies to tackle the root causes of low productivity, promote innovation and bolster the single European market.
For instance, the EU will need an additional €5.4 trillion between 2025 and 2031 to advance our green transformation, accelerate the digitalisation of our economy and bolster our defence capabilities.[14]Faced with this mammoth task, deepening the capital markets union to help guide the required financing flows should be our highest priority. This will help channel private investments towards supporting innovation and the twin green and digital transition – ultimately fostering EU competitiveness.
To speed up the integration of a single banking market in Europe, we should now move forward and complete the banking union.
As a first step, we must enhance the crisis management and deposit insurance framework so that the failures of small and medium-sized banks can be dealt with more effectively.
Second, we would welcome if Member States were to resume discussions on setting-up a European-level public backstop to provide temporary liquidity funding to banks following resolution. The credibility of the resolution framework in Europe would be significantly enhanced by setting up a framework for liquidity in resolution.
Moreover, building on the strong foundations of the SSM and the Single Resolution Mechanism, we must pave the way for a common European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). In the first decade of the SSM, risks have been significantly reduced and common supervisory standards have been established. These preconditions for EDIS have now been met, and moving it forward will be important for severing any remaining feedback loops between banks and sovereigns, given that these proved so harmful during the sovereign debt crisis.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Ten years ago today, when European supervisory teams started to come together for the first time, it was not at all certain that the SSM would be a success.
We have since built a strong and effective supervisory framework in Europe, perceptive to evolving risks and – whenever necessary and appropriate – insistent in making sure that material risks are addressed. European banks have notably improved, proving resilient to shocks that we couldn’t have imagined a decade ago. This resilience is also a result of the strengthened supervisory and regulatory framework put in place after the global financial crisis, including the creation of the banking union.
Ten years ago, the first Vice-Chair of the SSM, Sabine Lautenschläger, invoked the parallel of an athlete at the beginning of a career, who trained extremely hard and achieved an excellent result in a first major tournament.[15]To turn this promising start into a track record of sustained high performance, the athlete clearly cannot afford to rest on her laurels. Instead, she needs to go right back to the routine of constant training, to keep developing her skills and thus continue to build the foundation for future success on a day-to-day basis.
This conclusion is as relevant today as it was ten year ago, especially considering the challenges along the path ahead.
Considering the macro-financial environment and volatile risk landscape, it is safe to say that there is a high likelihood of unprecedented shocks continuing to emerge over the next decade. To make sure banks continue to serve European households and businesses under these challenging circumstances, we must ensure they remain resilient. Because a stable banking system forms the bedrock of long-term competitiveness and sustainable growth.
European supervisors will continue to work tirelessly to make sure banks are well capitalised and adequately manage their risks. In this way, in ten years’ time we can celebrate another successful decade of resilient banks under European supervision."

The global economy and finance need nature to survive. Analysis by the ECB shows that the economy depends critically on nature: 72% of non-financial businesses in the euro area – around 4.2 million individual companies – would experience significant problems as a result of ecosystem degradation. These businesses rely on ecosystem services like fertile soils, timber and clean water. And 75% of bank loans are tied to these businesses. So, if they run into trouble, the banks that finance them will too. This interdependence underscores why the ECB made nature one of the focus areas of its climate and nature plan for 2024 and 2025. It is also why we push banks under our supervision to manage all material nature-related risks.
The ECB does not stand alone in recognising this threat. The value of nature for the economy is acknowledged by the global Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, which has 141 members worldwide. Additionally, a recent stocktake by the Financial Stability Board showed that a growing number of policy authorities around the world are considering the potential implications of nature-related risks for financial stability.
In recognition of the vital importance of nature for the economy, international fora must ensure that nature considerations are fully integrated into regulation and supervision, alongside ongoing efforts to account for climate-related considerations. This starts with identifying exposures and vulnerabilities to nature-related risks.
While central banks and supervisors are not nature policymakers, we must take nature into account to fulfil our mandate of price stability and safe and sound banks. Otherwise, we risk failing to deliver on our mandate.
My message on this Finance and Biodiversity Day is clear: if you destroy nature, you destroy the economy. The right conditions must be established for nature – and consequently the economy – to thrive. The economy needs nature to survive. Financial stability needs nature to survive. To deliver on our mandate, we need nature to survive. And the survival of nature requires financing. Therefore, your success here in Cali is vitally important.
Thank you. Buena suerte."

Madrid, 28 October 2024
Inflation in the euro area has come a long way. After peaking at more than 10% in October 2022 (in Spain, it peaked in July 2022), headline inflation stood at 1.7% in September this year. This was 0.5 percentage points lower than in August, largely reflecting a sharp drop in energy inflation. Core inflation has also fallen substantially from its peak, edging down from 2.8% in August to 2.7% in September.
Most measures of underlying inflation have declined or remained unchanged. Domestic inflation remains high, reflecting elevated services inflation as wage pressures remain strong, but it too is showing signs of moderation.
Inflation is expected to rise again later this year – partly due to base effects, as previous sharp falls in energy prices drop out of annual rates – before declining to our target of 2% in the course of next year. Inflation expectations of euro area firms and consumers have declined across all horizons. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stand at around 2%.
So, taken together, the incoming information shows that the disinflationary process is now well on track.
The outlook, however, is surrounded by substantial risks. The geopolitical situation, especially the conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s war against Ukraine, poses a particular upside risk to inflation. Heightened geopolitical tensions could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Extreme weather events could drive up food prices. And inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages and profits increase by more than expected. But we may also see downside surprises in inflation – for example as a result of a stronger-than-expected dampening impact of monetary policy on demand, an unexpected worsening of the global economic environment, or a slower recovery in consumption and investment due to concerns about geopolitical events.
Economic activity in the euro area has been weaker than expected, with persisting differences across sectors. The composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell into contractionary territory in September, its deterioration broad-based across countries and sub-indices. The manufacturing output PMI fell further while the services sector continued to expand, though at a slowing pace, pointing to an overall weaker near-term outlook for growth.
Despite rising incomes, household consumption remained weak and savings increased by more than expected. This was likely due to higher real returns on savings, efforts to recuperate past losses in real wealth and, more broadly, the lagged response of consumption to rising incomes.
The labour market remains resilient, with the unemployment rate at 6.4% in August, its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. However, surveys point to slowing employment growth and a further moderation in the demand for labour.
Economic activity is expected to strengthen as real incomes rise and the easing of financing conditions supports consumption and investment. With global demand increasing, exports are also expected to contribute to the recovery.
However, risks to the growth outlook remain elevated and tilted to the downside. In particular, lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected and geopolitical risks continue to pose a threat to the world economy by disrupting energy supplies and global trade. But euro area growth could be higher if the world economy grows more strongly than expected or if declining inflation and less restrictive monetary policy lead to a faster recovery in consumption and investment.
Financial stability
As concerns about inflation abate, weaker growth prospects are weighing on the outlook for financial stability in the euro area. At the same time, geopolitical risks and political uncertainty continue to raise the likelihood of tail events.
Let me mention three broad financial stability issues which stand out. First, while financial markets have shown resilience in recent periods of turmoil, they remain vulnerable to adverse dynamics as risk pricing appears too benign. Moreover, the non-bank financial sector – which is less transparent and subject to lighter regulation – could amplify any market correction, given concentrated exposures, liquidity and leverage vulnerabilities. Second, heightened political risks have highlighted closely interlinked vulnerabilities in sovereign, corporate, household, bank and non-bank sectors. Sovereign vulnerabilities are increasing, driven by heightened policy uncertainty and weak growth prospects. At the same time, interconnectedness between corporates, banks and non-banking intermediaries could create negative feedback loops if risks materialise in any of these sectors. Third, although conditions in commercial real estate markets have shown signs of stabilisation, there is a risk that the full scale of the correction is not yet reflected in valuations and that conditions could worsen again.
The Governing Council of the ECB has responded forcefully to the largest euro area inflation surge on record. We raised our key policy rates by a total of 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023. We had kept them at those restrictive levels until June this year, with the key interest rates – in particular the deposit facility rate, through which we steer the monetary policy stance – contributing substantially to the ongoing disinflation process. Following the two 25 basis point cuts in June and September this year, we decided to lower the key ECB interest rates again at our October meeting, based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
We remain determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. As we have made clear in our communication, the Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction."

Statement by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the fiftieth meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee
IMF Annual Meetings, 25 October 2024
Introduction
Since our last meeting in April, the global growth outlook has remained broadly unchanged. While global growth is projected to expand at a moderate pace, risks to the outlook have shifted to the downside, reflecting rising economic policy uncertainty against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. Global headline inflation continues to recede amid falling energy prices, the normalisation of supply conditions and still tight monetary policy.
In October the Governing Council lowered the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which it steers the monetary policy stance – reflects the Governing Council’s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflation process is well on track. Recent indicators of economic activity have surprised somewhat to the downside and financing conditions remain restrictive.
The Governing Council will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve its two per cent medium-term inflation target in a timely manner. The appropriate level and duration of restriction will continue to be determined by following a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach. In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular interest rate path.
The Governing Council recently initiated an assessment of its monetary policy strategy, which will focus on the changed inflation environment and its implications for the monetary policy strategy, with conclusions expected in the second half of 2025.
Economic activity
After the broad stagnation in activity in 2023, euro area real GDP expanded moderately in the first half of this year, helped by the recovery in foreign demand and public spending. Private domestic demand remained weak, with households and firms still hesitant to consume and invest. Incoming data suggest economic activity may have softened again in the second half of the year amid rising geopolitical uncertainty.
Looking ahead, we expect growth to strengthen over time, as rising real incomes support household consumption and the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support consumption and investment. Exports should contribute to the recovery as global demand rises.
The labour market remains resilient, but indicators point towards cooling labour demand on the back of weaker economic activity. Employment continued to grow in the second quarter of 2024, albeit at a slower rate than in the first quarter of the year. In August the unemployment rate remained at 6.4%, its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. Labour productivity is expected to recover in the future as labour hoarding unwinds and profit margins moderate.
Fiscal and structural policies should be aimed at making the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. That would help to raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium term. To this end, it is crucial to swiftly follow up, with concrete and ambitious structural policies, on Mario Draghi's proposals for enhancing European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s proposals for empowering the Single Market. Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully, transparently and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis. Governments should now make a strong start in this direction in their medium-term plans for fiscal and structural policies.
Risks to growth remain tilted to the downside. Lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as quickly as expected. This could be amplified by sources of geopolitical risk, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Lower demand for euro area exports due, for instance, to a weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies would further weigh on euro area growth. Growth could be lower if the lagged impact of our monetary policy tightening turns out stronger than expected. However, growth could also be higher if the world economy grows more strongly than expected or if easier financing conditions and declining inflation lead to a faster rebound in consumption and investment.
Inflation
Headline inflation fell to 1.7% in September 2024 due mainly to a sharp drop in energy inflation, following a broadly declining path since the last IMFC meeting. Core inflation – HICP inflation excluding energy and food – began to moderate in recent months after an overall sideways trend, reflecting mainly declining goods inflation. Services inflation edged down in September, but has been more persistent, hovering around 4%.
Most measures of underlying inflation have been gradually moderating in recent months. However, domestic inflation remains elevated, with strong price pressures coming from wages in particular. Wage growth has continued to be strong, but overall growth in labour costs has been moderating in recent quarters and profits have been buffering the impact of higher wages on inflation.
Looking ahead, we expect inflation to temporarily increase again in the fourth quarter of this year as the previous sharp falls in energy prices drop out of the annual rates. Thereafter, inflation should resume its decline, reaching our target next year and averaging 1.9% in 2026 according to the September staff projections.
Inflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could disrupt global trade and push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term. Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly.
Financial stability, euro area banking sector and non-bank financial intermediation
The financial stability of the euro area continues to be affected by geopolitical risks and uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic outlook. The financial stability outlook remains fragile, with elevated vulnerabilities. Geopolitical risks from intra- and inter-country conflicts coupled with election uncertainties could trigger a sharp reversal of risk sentiment and weaken macro-financial conditions, leading to negative feedback loops between governments and both the non-financial and financial sectors. While the sharp corrections we saw in financial markets over the summer were short-lived, benign risk pricing underscores the potential for more disruptive developments. Additionally, although commercial real estate markets have shown signs of stabilising, the full scale of the correction may not yet have been reflected in valuations, which are slow to adjust.
Euro area banks have been a source of resilience thanks to their sizeable liquidity and capital buffers, and their profitability has been robust thanks to improved net interest margins. However, these profits will likely begin to moderate alongside declining rates. Asset quality is starting to weaken from a historically high level, particularly in commercial property lending. Bank valuations remain subdued and are vulnerable to geopolitical uncertainty, although recent political events have had a limited impact on the financial sector more broadly. From a macroprudential policy perspective and against a background of headwinds and uncertainty, it is crucial that the existing requirements for releasable capital buffers are maintained, or in some countries increased, and that adequate borrower-based measures are implemented as required. It is important that key jurisdictions are making progress in implementing Basel III. A full, faithful and timely implementation of Basel III is crucial, as strong regulation and supervision ensure that banks remain safe and sound.
Risks in the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector remain elevated, despite some rebalancing towards higher-quality assets. Asset price corrections and market volatility, as well as macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, could trigger outflows from open-ended investment funds or margin calls for investment funds, insurance companies and pension funds. These dynamics would increase the likelihood of forced sales, which could negatively affect the markets in which non-bank financial intermediaries invest. Additionally, parts of the NBFI sector are highly leveraged, which could amplify liquidity shocks to the wider financial system. This underlines the need to strengthen the NBFI policy framework, including from a macroprudential perspective, in an internationally coordinated manner.
International cooperation
Geopolitical tensions are increasingly giving rise to economic and financial fragmentation and pose a significant risk to global prosperity, with trade flows already visibly decoupling along lines of geopolitical influence. So far, this decoupling has been limited to specific sectors, such as energy and key advanced technologies. ECB analysis suggests that trade fragmentation could result in global GDP losses ranging from nearly 6% in a scenario of higher trade barriers only being erected for strategic products, to 9% in a more severe scenario of full decoupling. Trade fragmentation could lead to renewed inflationary pressures globally, not only because of increased production input costs but also on account of reduced diversification opportunities. Overall, this would make it more challenging for central banks to ensure price stability. It is therefore crucial that legitimate concerns about security and supply chain resilience do not lead to a spiral of protectionism. Multilateral cooperation is more important than ever if we are to preserve the unparalleled achievements in global growth and poverty reduction of recent decades, and securing global peace is a precondition for economic prosperity.
With the IMF marking its 80th anniversary this year, its role and work remain absolutely critical in the current complex global environment. The Fund’s multilateral and bilateral surveillance function remains as important as ever in protecting member countries from crises, and the upcoming Comprehensive Surveillance Review will help establish the most relevant priorities for years to come. We welcome the recent decisions to strengthen the IMF’s lending toolkit as part of the Review of Charges and the Surcharges Policy and the Review of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust Facilities and Financing.We support the IMF’s position at the centre of the global financial safety net, with a strong core mandate, and we highly value its unique role in bridge-building and facilitating global cooperation to tackle common challenges. We welcome the fact that Sub-Saharan Africa will shortly occupy the newly created seat on the IMF’s Executive Board, which will significantly contribute to improving the overall balance of regional representation.
We continue to witness an increase in economic losses and financial risks stemming from extreme physical climate hazards, including record-breaking heatwaves in Asia, devastating floods and wildfires in the Americas and central and eastern Europe, and more frequent tropical storms in the Caribbean and South Asia. Adaptation measures to shield our lives and economies from the impact of climate change, alongside ambitious policies to put the climate transition on track, are more relevant than ever. We support international progress on transition planning, enabling corporations, financial institutions and governments to set up credible net-zero roadmaps in a systematic way. Furthermore, it is essential to further develop more systematic and comprehensive approaches to assess the impact of escalating nature-related economic and financial risks on price and financial stability, including integrated climate and nature risk analyses."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics Conference 2024 organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the ECB
Cleveland, 24 October 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to provide an update on underlying inflation in the euro area.[1]The concept of underlying inflation plays a central role in the conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy: our interest rate decisions are based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. This three-pronged reaction function complements the traditional focus on the inflation forecast for inflation-targeting central banks with the signals embodied in underlying inflation measures, while also incorporating the evolving evidence on the strength of monetary policy transmission in the calibration of the monetary stance. This pragmatic approach reflects the value of data dependence under highly atypical macroeconomic conditions.
Latest developments in euro area underlying inflation
Underlying inflation is the persistent component of inflation, signalling where headline inflation will settle in the medium term after temporary factors have vanished. In practice, underlying inflation is unobservable and needs to be proxied or estimated. There are two broad categories of measures that aim to capture this concept. Exclusion-based measures omit certain items – such as energy and food – that are typically volatile and more sensitive to global factors than domestic fundamentals. Model-based measures, meanwhile, capture more complex channels and dynamics, subject to the limitations imposed by sensitivity to model estimation. An overview of such measures is shown in Chart 1.
Model-based measures at the ECB include the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which is constructed by estimating a dynamic factor model that extracts the persistent and common component of inflation from granular price data at the item-country level, thereby exploiting the relative advantages of both cross-sectional and time series approaches.[2]Another model-based measure is Supercore inflation, which picks out those items that are estimated to co-move with the business cycle. These model-based measures are reduced form in nature and, among other factors, reflect the empirical contribution of monetary policy tightening to delivering disinflation. That is to say, if current inflation is above target, one reason why underlying inflation might run below current inflation is that the projected mean reversion is partly driven by endogenous monetary policy tightening that has historically contributed to the return of inflation to the target over the medium term. In turn, monitoring the evolution of underlying inflation is an important element in diagnosing whether monetary policy is appropriately calibrated.
Each of the underlying inflation indicators tracked by the ECB has declined significantly since the post-pandemic inflation surges, with the range narrowing towards its historical average. The majority of indicators are hovering around 1.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent, down from a much wider range between 3.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent at its peak (Chart 1). Core inflation is the most prominent exclusion-based measure, defined as HICP inflation excluding energy and food: this edged down to 2.7 per cent in September, continuing the marked decline from 4.5 per cent a year ago.[3]In terms of model-based measures, the PCCI today is at the bottom of the range, standing at 1.9 per cent in September and having hovered around 2.0 per cent since the end of last year. Most other measures that we regularly monitor have also come down over the past year and show signs of continued easing in September.
One challenge in interpreting standard indicators of underlying inflation is that these were affected by the past extraordinary supply shocks, as well as by temporary mismatches between demand and supply. As I pointed out in my March 2023 speech, it is helpful to think of headline inflation as being driven by three factors: (i) underlying inflation; (ii) a reverting component; and (iii) pure noise.[4]In particular, the major dislocations of recent years induced a substantial reverting component of inflation that was sufficiently long-lasting not to constitute pure noise but that was also expected to fade out over time. These dislocations included the impact of energy inflation and supply bottlenecks. To capture their indirect impact on measures of underlying inflation, we have in parallel monitored adjusted measures of underlying inflation that “partial out” these indirect influences. These adjusted measures had a significantly lower peak rate of underlying inflation than the un-adjusted measures but, by construction, were also less affected by the sharp turnaround in energy prices and easing of supply bottlenecks during 2023 that flattered the speed of progress in the un-adjusted measures. Currently, these adjustments bring down the range to between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent, as the impact of past supply-side shocks has greatly diminished. In particular, the forward-looking PCCI measures are by now free of such impacts.
Each measure of underlying inflation provides useful information about future headline inflation, although their forecasting performance varies. Chart 2 shows the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE) for each measure vis-à-vis inflation two years ahead and vis-à-vis a smoothed inflation rate. Forecasting performance is normalised to the predictive power of current headline inflation: that is, a ratio below unity means that the measure does a better job than current headline inflation in forecasting future inflation. Indeed, most measures beat current headline inflation in forecasting future inflation. The PCCI measures have the best predictive power, while most exclusion-based measures perform less well.
However, in understanding the inflation process and calibrating monetary policy, it is essential to look beyond overall predictive power and also examine how the various underlying inflation measures can shed light on the speed and sequencing of the disinflation process. For instance, external shocks were a prominent feature of the post-pandemic economic landscape.[5]While the PCCI measures provided a powerful signal that these shocks would ultimately fade out, the delayed and lagged adjustment in indicators such as services inflation, domestic inflation and wage growth served to highlight that convergence to the medium-term target would not be immediate.[6]I will focus on these indicators in the next part of my talk.
Services, domestic inflation and wages
Domestic inflation captures price dynamics in consumption items that are less influenced by external factors, being more determined by domestic economic conditions, including monetary policy. While trends in the relative prices of globally-determined components (mostly in the energy, food and goods categories) mean that the two per cent target for overall inflation is not a target for domestic inflation, domestic inflation cannot remain at an excessive level if the target is to be sustainably achieved.[7]Moreover, assessing the strength of domestic inflation is essential to the calibration of monetary policy, since domestic inflation will be more responsive than global inflation components to the impact of monetary policy via the dampening of domestic demand.
The domestic inflation indicator monitored at the ECB is an aggregation of HICP items with low import content.[8]As shown in Chart 3, domestic inflation and services inflation co-move closely. This reflects the dominance of services items in the domestic inflation measures, accounting for 97 per cent of the overall index. At the same time, it remains useful to maintain domestic inflation and services inflation as separate measures: while almost 80 per cent of the services items are included in the domestic inflation index, the overall services category also includes highly-traded services items (Chart 4). These internationally-traded services items currently have a lower contribution to services inflation than domestic services items.
The large supply-side shocks of the post-pandemic period have been feeding through to domestic inflation with a lag compared with other measures of underlying inflation. Large supply-side shocks have travelled across sectors and consumption items at different speeds, so it is unsurprising that these had differential impacts on the various measures of underlying inflation, depending on their nature and construction.
Domestic inflation and services inflation tend to lag headline inflation more than other measures, exhibiting a lower frequency of price adjustment compared with the energy, food and goods categories in the HICP.[9]For this reason, many items in services inflation and domestic inflation were late movers that responded with a much longer lag to the latest inflationary shock, such that annual services inflation remains elevated.[10]Chart 5 shows the impact of energy and supply-chain bottlenecks on the PCCIs, domestic inflation and other measures of underlying inflation. Among these measures, PCCIs are more forward-looking and have picked up certain shocks faster, but with the byproduct that the effects of the shocks also faded quicker. Other indicators, like domestic inflation, are more backward-looking, and the currently higher levels also reflect the still ongoing propagation of past shocks. In similar vein, the past shocks took longer to build up in domestic inflation and are also taking longer to dissipate.
The PCCI for services indicates that there is currently a sizeable gap between services inflation and its medium-term underlying trend, suggesting there is scope for downward adjustment in services inflation in the coming months. Services PCCI has been around 2.4 per cent since the end of last year, well below the current annual rate for services (Chart 6, left panel).[11]This difference suggests that idiosyncratic and non-persistent factors are currently driving services inflation. Examples of such idiosyncratic factors include the base effect related to the introduction of the cheap travel Deutschland-ticket in Germany in May 2023, rent inflation in the Netherlands, and items that reprice less frequently, such as insurance or other administered prices (like hospital services) in some countries.
Over time, the fading out of these idiosyncratic and temporary factors should means that services inflation declines towards the underlying rate. Indeed, momentum indicators for services confirm the slight easing of inflation dynamics. While services momentum (i.e. the three-month-on-three-month growth rate of the seasonally-adjusted index) remains high, it has been continuously easing since May (Chart 6, right panel). The month-on-month seasonally-adjusted rate markedly dropped in September.[12]
Services and domestic inflation are closely linked to wage growth: the expected easing of wage growth in 2025, together with the impact of past monetary policy tightening, should contribute to further disinflation. Wages constitute a higher direct share in costs of services than goods and Chart 7 highlights the strong link between domestic inflation, services and wages: their level is normally similar and they closely co-move with each other.[13]Chart 7 also shows how pressures in these three components can take time to moderate following a tightening in policy.
Wage growth is expected to ease from its current high level, with the cumulative increase in nominal wages over 2023-2024 largely restoring the purchasing power that was lost during the inflation surges of 2021-2022. Wage pressures are currently still high: the growth rate of compensation per employee stood at 4.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, albeit down from its peak of 5.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2023.
Recently, the incoming information for 2024 in the ECB wage tracker indicator of latest agreements shows that wage agreements signed in 2024 had substantially lower structural wage growth for the next 12 months if their previous agreement was signed in 2023 or 2022, as compared with 2021 (Chart 8, left panel). Moreover, in the months ahead, there are fewer wage agreements coming up for renegotiation that have not had an agreement since the surge in inflation (Chart 8, right panel). This suggests that the catching up motive in wage negotiations is losing ground as inflation normalises. Forward-looking indicators suggest further diminishing wage pressures into 2025 (Chart 9). The forward-looking wage tracker (dark blue line in Chart 9) shows the wage growth until the end of 2025 in the available contracts that have been agreed and signed.
One caveat in interpreting developments in the forward- looking wage tracker is that, since it only considers agreements that are active in the future, the contract coverage on which it is based declines as contracts expire (solid grey area in Chart 9). For this reason, scenarios for the expiring contracts (in the grey striped area) can help to assess risks around the outlook for wages. The scenarios illustrated in Chart 9 assume different renegotiated annual wage growth for expired contracts: (i) full pass-through of HICP and real productivity growth top-up to wages; (ii) HICPX and real productivity growth top-up to wages; (iii) wages increase at the same very strong level as contracts signed in the second quarter of 2024 that were still recouping large real wage losses (this is an upper bound scenario). Even this upper-bound scenario points to a slowdown in wage pressures in 2025 compared with 2024. This reflects in part that base effects, for example those related to high one-off payments this year, will dampen future wage growth in year-on-year terms.
The latest information from surveys reinforces the projection of easing wage growth that will underpin the moderation in services inflation and domestic inflation. Chart 10 presents consecutive rounds of various ECB surveys, which provide a wealth of valuable information that helps us gauge the pulse of the economy in real time. The incoming survey information on wage growth provided by both firms and professional forecasters confirm the narrative embedded in our September 2024 ECB staff projection that wage growth will ease in 2025 compared with 2024, primarily owing to the fading out of the catch-up dynamic that has dominated wage negotiations between 2022 and 2024.
In summary, in analysing services inflation and domestic inflation, it is crucial to distinguish between the underlying persistent component that matters for the medium term and the backward-looking reverting component that takes time to fade out but that ultimately reflects the staggered nature of the adjustment process to the original and extraordinary inflation shocks. This backward-looking component has been substantial: the inflation shocks of 2021-2022 spread across sectors at varying speeds. The slowest-moving sectors were those in which prices adjust more slowly or are most closely tied to wage adjustment. For these indicators, we need patience as the normalisation process takes time.
Conclusion
In my remarks today, I have sought to provide an update on the dynamics of underlying inflation. I have emphasised that underlying inflation measures not only serve to extract the persistent component from the latest inflation readings but also provide insights into the nature of disinflation, especially in relation to the staggered nature of the adjustment process. In particular, the analysis of underlying inflation suggests that 2024 is a transition year, in which backward-looking components are still playing out. But the analysis of underlying inflation also indicates that the disinflation process is well on track, and inflation is set to return to target in the course of 2025."
38,2024-10-16,Christine Lagarde,Lessons from Ljubljana in uncertain times,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2024/html/ecb.sp241016~33fd097e21.en.html,"Lessons from Ljubljana in uncertain times
Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the official dinner of Banka Slovenije in Ljubljana, Slovenia
Ljubljana, 16 October 2024
It is a pleasure to be here this evening.
Not far from here, tucked away in the National and University Library, lie copies of theAbecedariumand theCatechism. These two texts, written by the religious reformer Primož Trubar in 1550, were the first ever books to be printed in Slovenian.[1]
At a time when German was the language of the ruling classes, Trubar’s pioneering act was fundamental in helping to establish the national identity of Slovenians.[2]
Today, his portrait graces the €1 coin in Slovenia, framed by the famous words found in theCatechism, “Stati inu Obstati” – “to stand and withstand”.[3]
It is telling that both books – one a primer for the Slovenian language, the other guidelines for religious observance – were designed to teach, for there is much that Europe can learn from Slovenia in the uncertain world we now face.
The global order we knew is fading. Open trade is being replaced with fragmented trade, multilateral rules with state-sponsored competition and stable geopolitics with conflict.
Europe had invested considerably in the old order, so this transition is challenging for us. As the most open of the major economies, we are more exposed than others.
So, in this new landscape, we too must learn “to stand and withstand”. And we can do so by drawing on two valuable lessons from Ljubljana.
Opportunity in times of uncertainty
The first lesson is that uncertainty can create opportunity.
While many in Europe are anxious about the future, Slovenians are no strangers to uncertainty.
Within a single generation, Slovenia made a success of the extraordinarily difficult transition from a planned economy to a market economy. Policymakers defied the odds by implementing tough structural reforms to first join the EU and, later, the euro area.
Today, Slovenia is a success story. It is a developed, stable and high-income economy, with the highest GDP per capita at purchasing power parity of central and eastern European countries (CEECs).
The nation’s success owes much to the creativity and vigour of its people and their innate ability to seize economic turning points and transform them into opportunities.
For example, when Slovenia joined the EU, it was exposed to greater levels of competition from other Member States in the economic bloc.
But Slovenia quickly capitalised on its skilled workforce to develop a new business model based on deep integration in the Single Market. Today, every single car produced in Europe has at least one component that is made in Slovenia.[4]
For Europe, the changes in the global economy today represent a similar turning point. But if we approach it with the right spirit, I believe it can be an opportunity for renewal.
A less favourable global economy can push us to complete our domestic market. Fiercer foreign competition can encourage us to develop new technologies. More volatile geopolitics can drive us to become more energy secure and self-sufficient in our supply chains.
For Slovenia, the transformation of the automotive supply chain will be a particular challenge. But the economy is already adapting. For example, in July this year Slovenia secured a major investment in domestic electric vehicle production.[5]
For many Slovenians, striding into an unpredictable future may seem like second nature.
One of your most famous paintings, “The Sower”, hangs on display here at the National Gallery. Depicting an agricultural labourer at the crack of dawn hard at work sowing seeds in a field, the painting represents Slovenians’ resolute determination in the face of uncertainty.
The rest of us in Europe will need to draw on this example in the uncertain times ahead. If we do so, we can also turn uncertainty into opportunity.
The importance of sharing the benefits of change
The second lesson from Slovenia is that the benefits of change can – and should – be more widely shared.
The path of renewal for Europe is inescapably linked with new technology, especially digitalisation. But new technologies can sometimes lead to uneven labour market outcomes.
Slovenia has undergone remarkable technological change over the past 20 years. Today, the country’s level of digital development is 7% above the CEEC average and it can compete with some of the most digitally developed EU countries in certain areas.[6]
Yet Slovenia’s Gini coefficient – a measure of income inequality – is the second lowest in the OECD.[7]The country also benefits from high levels of gender equality. Female labour force participation is higher than the EU average and nearly equal to that of men.[8]
Many in Europe are worried about the challenges ahead, such as the effects of artificial intelligence on social inclusion. But we should let Slovenia’s example inspire us.
With the right approach, we can move forward and become more technologically advanced while ensuring everyone can benefit from the gains.
And when everyone benefits, Europe benefits too. Over three-quarters of citizens in Slovenia feel attached to Europe, and almost two-thirds identify as both Slovenian and European – levels that are well above their respective EU averages.[9]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In today’s uncertain world, Europe must learn “to stand and withstand”. And it can do so by looking to Slovenia as an example of how to overcome challenges that come its way.
First, we must work hard to sow the seeds of success. And then, as the folk singer Vlado Kreslin sings, “vse se da” –“everything is possible”.
Thank you."

Keynote speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Bundesbank Symposium on the Future of Payments
Frankfurt am Main, 7 October 2024
The foundations of the financial system as we know it today can be traced back to 14th-century Italy,[1]when double-entry bookkeeping[2]was introduced, along with nostro and vostro accounts[3]to facilitate the settlement of foreign trades across separate, independent ledgers[4].
Although today’s financial markets are highly complex and sophisticated, the fundamental practice of bookkeeping across ledgers has remained largely unchanged and continues to exert a significant influence on existing market structures. For example, at each stage of the securities life cycle, banks, brokers, information providers and other market participants play an essential role in intermediation. This complexity comes at a cost: research shows that on the whole, financial intermediation costs in advanced economies have increased since the late 1960s.[5]
In Europe, this complexity is compounded by regulatory fragmentation across the continent, resulting in the ongoing fragmentation of capital markets. For example, there are 35 different exchanges for listings and 41 exchanges for trading.[6]Some effort has been made towards integration in the post-trade sector, including through the creation of the TARGET2-Securities (T2S) platform, which can be used to transfer securities and cash between investors across Europe[7], and through common platforms used by central securities depositories (CSDs). But the lack of harmonisation in the legislative and regulatory framework regarding custody, asset servicing and tax-related processes, for example, prevents the sector from reaping the benefits and synergies that an integrated European market could bring.[8]
The European Union (EU) has taken steps to address the regulatory barriers that exist in order to create deeper and more integrated capital markets.[9]But many obstacles still remain, such as insufficient regulatory harmonisation, the absence of unified supervision[10]or the lack of a permanent safe asset and integrated banking system[11]. This has led to multiple calls for renewed efforts, including from euro area finance ministers[12], EU institutions[13]and Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi in their recent reports[14].
But there is one crucial dimension that has often been overlooked, and that is technology. My aim today is not to discuss how to create a capital markets union for traditional assets, but to discuss how to create one for digital assets from the outset.
Although technology has undeniably helped facilitate the provision of financial services through electronic bookkeeping, for example, digital technology has so far failed to deliver financial integration in Europe. In fact, non-interoperable technological ecosystems in each country – shaped by diverging national regulatory regimes – have created siloed pools of asset liquidity, further entrenching fragmentation.
However,recent advancements in digital technology offer an opportunity to createan integrated European capital market for digital assets – in other words, a digital capital markets union.
Financial institutions are increasingly exploring the potential of tokenisation, which is the process of using new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), to issue or represent assets in digital form, known as tokens. Unlike conventional assets, these tokens are not recorded on a centralised ledger but using DLT. Imagine a future where money and securities no longer sit in electronic, book-entry accounts but “live” on distributed ledgers held across a network of traders, each with a synchronised copy.
If public authorities fail to act, this could lead to fragmentation. But if they seize the opportunity, then the benefits of this new approach could reach far beyond tackling technological inefficiencies, eventually resulting in a move away from the centuries-old structure of intermediation to a unified, distributed ledger or a constellation of fully interoperable ledgers. This transition could help us deal with the current fragmentation of financial infrastructures, reduce barriers to entry and serve as a driver of capital market integration in Europe.
As a central bank, we recognise that our role in this transformative journey is to maintain trust and confidence in the value of money and the financial system. To fulfil this mandate, we have to adapt to the evolving technological landscape that is reshaping how money is exchanged and financial transactions are settled in an increasingly digital world. Understanding these innovations, preparing for them and – when they materialise – supporting their safe adoption are central to our mission. In addition,central bank money has a key role to play in facilitating the interoperability and integration of decentralised systems.[15]
Today, I want to explore how we can build an integrated European capital market for digital assets from the outset. At the same time, while the potential benefits of advances tokenisation and DLT are significant, we must also consider the risks to the financial market structure and the provision of central bank money. I will discuss how central banks can effectively support this technological transition.
The transformative potential of tokenisation and DLT in capital markets: balancing innovation with risk
In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the adoption of financial technology, including the use of tokens and DLT. This transformation is not just theoretical: it is happening now.
In the banking sector alone, over 60% of EU banks surveyed are actively exploring, experimenting with or using DLT solutions, while 22% have already started using DLT applications.[16]However, the use of DLT is not yet widespread. Currently, it is mainly used for primary issuance, although further applications and use cases are increasingly being looked at. But there is strong interest in exploring the potential of DLT, and leading global financial market infrastructures such as DTCC, Clearstream and Euroclear are aiming to set standards to facilitate the adoption of tokenisation across the financial sector.
The public sector is also contributing to this movement. Since having a solution for settling transactions in central bank money makes DLT-based solutions more attractive and less risky, there is strong demand from market participants to be able to use central bank money to settle digital asset transactions. As a result, the Eurosystem is conducting exploratory work to test DLT for the settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money.[17]Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements’ Innovation Hub has launched several projects exploring this theme.[18]
The promise of tokenisation and DLT lies in the creation of a transparent ledger which would make it possible to perform the three key functions of asset trading, namely negotiation, settlement and custody, on the same platform.[19]This is expected to reduce transaction costs by reducing the need for reconciliation, matching and other data processing steps, which would foster resilience and make it possible to operate on a 24/7, 365 days a year basis. DLT also supports the native issuance of digital assets, enabling direct transactions between a wide range of investors. This could lower barriers to entry and create opportunities for small issuers, such as small and medium-sized enterprises, to access capital markets. DLT would also enhance efficiency by significantly reducing settlement times and using the self-executing, programmable functions in smart contracts.
This could potentially bring substantial savings. According to some estimates, automation and smart contracts could reduce annual infrastructure operational costs by approximately USD 15-20 billion in global capital markets.[20]
In addition to these savings, the possibility of extensive implementation of tokenisation and DLT offers opportunities to overhaul market structures. This could prove instrumental in tackling the technological obstacles hindering the establishment of a capital markets union in Europe. The new ecosystem could be designed from scratch in a more integrated and harmonised manner by providing a “common set of rails” – a shared ledger or an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers – that would ensure reachability, open access and compatibility across participants’ services. CSDs, banks, investment managers and other market stakeholders would provide their services directly on a shared infrastructure, while each would be able to maintain a level of control and customisation over the functionalities. This would also allow a more flexible approach to the role of each participant in the ecosystem. From a technical perspective, it would also be possible to bring together all assets, functionalities and market players on one centralised platform. But it is precisely the combination of a shared infrastructure with customised control that could encourage different stakeholders to agree on “common rails” instead of relying on their own infrastructures, as they often do today.
However, the early development stages of DLT present significant coordination challenges and risks to the financial system.
There are therefore three primary risks that we must address.
The first is the potential for an uncoordinated proliferation of DLT platforms, which could result in a fragmented landscape. In this nascent stage of development, established financial institutions are apprehensive about DLT but are nevertheless keen to take advantage of its potential. Several new DLT platforms could emerge as a result, as market participants develop their own solutions without fully considering the broader economic implications. This could exacerbate the existing fragmentation among CSDs and other proprietary ledgers, leading to a lack of standardisation. This, in turn, would pose new coordination challenges and jeopardise our objective of establishing a digital capital markets union for Europe.[21]
The second risk is that central bank money could lose its status as the safest and most liquid settlement asset. If end users – in this case firms and investors – demand an “on-chain” means of payment to seamlessly support automated transactions via DLT, the lack of a solution for settling transactions in central bank money could encourage banks or stablecoin issuers to offer private money alternatives. A permanent shift from central bank money to commercial bank money or stablecoins could disrupt the existing two-tier monetary system and threaten financial stability by undermining central bank money’s role as a risk-free settlement asset. This would contradict the principles agreed at international level.[22]
Lastly, public authorities still have more work to do to understand and assess the inherent risks and vulnerabilities stemming from DLT-based tokenisation.[23]Tokenisation does not remove the vulnerabilities we know of from traditional finance, although these vulnerabilities may play out differently depending on design choices, adoption and scale. The key issue will be the choice of settlement assets, which could amplify liquidity risk or other vulnerabilities, but other risks could also emerge if new entities fall outside the scope of regulation or there are operational weaknesses.
To deal with these risks, central banks and regulators must act early and work with market participants from the outset. If we drag our feet while other jurisdictions move faster and produce better solutions, we could see financial activities migrating elsewhere and private entities from outside the EU assuming a dominant position in European capital markets. Moreover, European market participants may then adopt uncoordinated approaches and invest in their own infrastructures. They could then resist any efforts by central banks to introduce enhanced settlement solutions, particularly if these threatened the viability of their new business models. If we don’t act soon, it may be impossible to achieve a genuine digital capital markets union with efficient wholesale payment and settlement services using risk-free central bank money.
A European vision for the future of digital capital markets
Given the early stage of market development and the strategic approaches being adopted by industry players, it is paramount that central banks provide clear direction. By offering clear and consistent guidance, the ECB serves as a crucial coordination mechanism for the European financial industry. This helps market participants align their efforts and innovate within a common framework, fostering interoperability.
Central banks should play a proactive role in this transformation for two main reasons. First, it is vitally important to maintain, if not increase, the use of central bank money as the settlement asset in wholesale markets. Central bank money plays a pivotal role as the anchor of our two-tier monetary system, serving as a cornerstone of financial stability.
The second reason is to promote robust, stable and integrated European capital markets. Therefore, our aim is to facilitate the provision of central bank money settlement for wholesale transactions of DLT assets, thereby using the financial industry’s adoption of DLT to address existing shortcomings associated with the fragmentation of European capital markets.
One way to achieve this would be to move towards a European ledger, which would be a single-platform solution where assets and cash would coexist on one chain. Many market participants believe this is a must if we want to fully reap the benefits of DLT. This ledger would address the technological complexities, inefficiencies and fragmentation that are currently preventing the integration of European capital markets for traditional assets.
A European ledger could bring together token versions of central bank money, commercial bank money and other digital assets on a shared, programmable platform. In essence, this would see T2S evolving into a DLT-based, single financial market infrastructure for Europe. While central banks would provide the platform, or the “rails” so to speak, market participants would supply the content, or the “trains”. However, further consideration would have to be given to the specifics of this platform, including the scope of services, governance structure, operational procedures and the potential implications for existing infrastructure and assets.
One risk of the unified ledger is that it entails choosing one technological solution over all others. As all market players will use it, they will be less inclined to explore and promote alternative innovative technical solutions to provide the same services. Another option would therefore be to allow the coordinated development of an ecosystem of fully interoperable technical solutions. This flexibility would be beneficial, as it would better serve specific use cases and the coexistence of legacy and new solutions.
We need to reflect on this trade-off.
Research is continuing in the market, but in the meantime, there is a pressing need for solutions that would make it possible to settle DLT transactions in central bank money. This provides an opportunity to build on the interoperability solutions we have been trialling as part of the Eurosystem’s exploratory work. This trial, in which the Eurosystem offers interoperability between its central bank money settlement services and external DLT platforms for both real and mock transactions, was successfully launched in May 2024 and will run until November. Some 60 industry participants are involved, in addition to central banks.
Offering such solutions could allow the Eurosystem and market participants to experiment and develop DLT-based solutions further, unlocking investment in the industry. To this end, we have started to look at how we can build on our ongoing exploration. We will also examine the eligibility of DLT-based assets for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.
However, there is a risk that relying on existing interoperability solutions over the long term could perpetuate inefficiencies in the post-trade environment given the ongoing lack of full harmonisation and standardisation. Such interim solutions are thus a stopgap measure to smooth the transition towards our long-term vision.
These efforts must align with EU legislators and regulators who have a window of opportunity to create a comprehensive, European regulatory and supervisory framework that will support financial integration for digital assets while protecting market participants and preserving the underlying infrastructures. The limited progress in advancing a capital markets union for traditional assets shows that harmonising new activities from the outset is much easier than ironing out any differences at a late stage. Building on the EU’s DLT pilot regime, this new framework should aim to establish the harmonised regulation and integrated supervision of digital assets.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In the current era of rapid technological change, “whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times”.[24]
These insights mirror the European financial sector’s current exploration of tokenisation and DLT. These technologies do not just have the potential to enhance efficiency. They could also fundamentally reshape the very structure of financial intermediation – a system that has remained largely unchanged for centuries. Many financial market participants have already started to delve into these technologies, recognising their transformative potential.
As prudent central bankers, we must also adapt to these new technologies if we are to fulfil our mandate of preserving trust and confidence in money and the financial system. Our primary objective in this evolving landscape is to ensure that central bank money – the safest and most liquid settlement asset – remains a cornerstone of stability, even in a capital market based on tokens and DLT. Or to quote Tancredi in Lampedusa’s The Leopard[25], “For things to stay the same, everything must change”.
However, the current nascent stage of market development does not just pose challenges. It also offers a unique opportunity. By establishing a clear vision of a digital capital markets union – an integrated European digital ecosystem where assets and cash coexist on one or more fully interoperable chains – these emerging technologies could help to address the existing shortcomings of European capital markets.
In embracing this technological shift, we are not merely reacting to change, but actively participating in shaping a more efficient, innovative and resilient financial future for Europe.
Thank you for your attention."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Sustainable Finance Lab Symposium on Finance in Transition
Amsterdam, 4 October 2024
Many great discoveries have been made outside well-controlled laboratory environments. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin when he returned from holiday and found mould growing on a Petri dish containing bacteria he was studying. Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity by accident after he put the equipment he used to study the relationship between x-rays and sunlight in a drawer on an overcast day. And Archimedes famously had his “eureka” moment while sitting in a bathtub.
Not all “eureka” moments happen in well-controlled laboratory experiments, but laboratories nevertheless provide an ideal controlled environment to make major discoveries. To develop ideas, test theories and move from scientific findings to practical solutions for real-world problems. Laboratories provide the bridge from theory to practice, from discovery to application and from insight to action.
Eureka!
Back in 2017 a small group of central banks and supervisors from around the world shared an insight that was relatively novel to them and their peers: climate and nature-related risks are a source of financial risk.[1]And this insight was as consequential as it was straightforward. If climate and nature-related risks are a source of financial risk, they fall squarely within the respective mandates of central banks and supervisors – to preserve price stability and ensure the safety and soundness of banks. In fact, if central banks and supervisors were to disregard climate and nature-related risks, they would run the risk of failing to deliver on their mandates.
This was a “eureka” moment for central banks and supervisors.
That small group of central banks and supervisors recognised that action was needed if they were to continue delivering on their mandates as the climate and nature crises increasingly affected the economy and the financial system. And so the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was founded in 2017, providing a much needed laboratory environment for central banks and supervisors working on climate and nature.[2]The NGFS was created as a platform to share, develop and advance practices to incorporate climate and nature-related considerations into the tasks and responsibilities of central banks and supervisors. And, importantly, to work closely with academics and stakeholder groups who were already considering the macro-financial consequences of global heating and nature degradation.
Sharing the “eureka!” moment
From that “eureka” moment, it quickly became the globally accepted consensus that climate and nature-related risks fall squarely within the mandates of central banks and supervisors. The NGFS has grown from eight members in 2017 to 142 members today. All of these central banks and supervisors – from all over the world – subscribe to the NGFS’s stance on the relevance of climate and nature-related risks and use the network as a platform to share experiences and best practices.
In addition, and to a large extent as a direct result of the NGFS’s pioneering work, climate-related risks now feature prominently in the work programmes of major international standard-setting bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the Financial Stability Board. Unfortunately, the same cannot yet be said for nature-related risks, though a recent stocktake on nature-related risks by the Financial Stability Board showed that a growing number of authorities have been considering the potential implications of nature-related risks for financial stability.[3]
In Europe, the relevance of climate and nature-related risks for the economy and the financial system has also been explicitly acknowledged by the legislator. The revised Capital Requirements Directive, which provides the regulatory and supervisory framework for banks in Europe, contains a clear reference to climate and nature-related risks. And the European Union’s climate objectives are explicitly recognised as part of its general economic policies.
Moreover, there is an ever-growing body of evidence showing the macro-financial relevance of climate and nature-related risks. Even if a successful and timely transition requires vast investment flows, analysis consistently confirms that the economic benefits of a transition far outweigh the costs. This conclusion holds especially when considered against the alternative scenarios of doing nothing or doing too little too late.[4]Moreover, if global heating and nature degradation are left unchecked, they will lead to increased macroeconomic volatility as climate and nature events become more severe and more frequent and have a greater impact on the economy – something we are already witnessing today.[5]
Regrettably, the prevailing consensus in climate science tells us that the goal of limiting global heating to 2 degrees Celsius, as set out in the Paris Agreement, is not currently being met. And it is not even close to being met. Last year the UN Emissions Gap Report concluded that the world is on track for an average increase of 2.9 degrees. And even that will only be achieved if all government commitments to mitigation measures are implemented in full and on time.This means that, besides the investment needs for the transition, policymakers also have to be increasingly mindful of the investment needs for adaption to increased damages from global heating and nature degradation.[6]
To sum up, there is no doubt that the ongoing climate and nature crises go to the heart of central banking and banking supervision. And that is why the ECB, moving in lockstep with the work being done by the NGFS, international standard-setting bodies and academia, has been taking action to incorporate climate and nature-related considerations into its monetary policy and supervisory tasks.
From “eureka!” to action: in monetary policy…
Let me start with the steps we have taken in the area of monetary policy.
When the ECB concluded its strategy review in the summer of 2021 – the first review since 2003 – the new strategy explicitly acknowledged the profound implications of climate change for the economy and its relevance for monetary policy. And this new strategy came with a concrete climate action plan.
In the three years since then, we have made significant progress in improving our ability to take climate considerations into account in the macroeconomic analyses that inform our policy discussions. We are now much better able to assess the economic consequences of the green transition in the euro area using a set of macroeconomic models.[7]Moreover, we are identifying physical risks that are already posing risks to price stability. We found, for instance, that increases in food prices following extreme heatwaves were an upside risk to price stability.[8]This risk has featured explicitly in our monetary policy assessment and communication in recent quarters.
With respect to our monetary policy instruments, in October 2022 we started tilting our reinvestments of corporate bonds towards issuers with a better climate performance. This enables us to avoid undue exposures to climate-related risks that are detrimental to price stability and to align the way we conduct our monetary policy more closely with the EU’s general economic policies. As of July 2023 we suspended bond purchases under our asset purchase programme, including corporate bonds, to help bring inflation back to our 2% target. We are still applying the tilting strategy in the partial reinvestments of maturing bonds in the context of our pandemic emergency purchase programme, until these reinvestments are also discontinued as intended at the end of 2024.[9]If any corporate bond purchases were needed for monetary policy purposes in the future, the established direction of the tilt would set the minimum benchmark.
In addition to our bond holdings, we are also looking at the collateral framework that we apply in relation to banks’ participation in our lending operations. As an early outcome of this work, in 2021 we started to accept sustainability-linked bonds as collateral, provided that they meet the eligibility criteria. We have also decided that only assets that comply with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will remain eligible once this Directive enters into force. And we are continuing to explore options to further incorporate climate considerations into our collateral framework. To this end, we are working with relevant authorities, such as the European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority, to encourage better disclosures from collateral issuers and in turn facilitate a better assessment of climate-related risks.
Our current actions aim to support a high degree of confidence in the alignment of our activities with the goals set by the Paris Agreement within our mandate. However, the decarbonisation path for our monetary policy assets remains dependent on actions that are not fully under our control, including the decarbonisation efforts made by the issuers of bonds that we hold.
This is one of the main reasons why we have committed to regularly reviewing all our measures to assess their impact. If necessary, we will adapt them to ensure they continue to fulfil their monetary policy objectives and support the decarbonisation path to reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate neutrality objectives. Within our mandate, we will also look into addressing additional nature-related challenges.
This process will be fully guided by our monetary policy strategy. Specifically, whenever we have a choice between two instruments – or calibrations of instruments – that are equally conducive to maintaining price stability, we are legally obliged to choose the one that best supports the general economic policies in the EU. This implies that whenever we adjust the calibration of our instruments, we must choose the option that supports our decarbonisation path, unless our proportionality assessment shows that there are other, less intrusive ways of achieving price stability.
Looking ahead, besides the adjustments that we are already implementing, this strategic commitment may require us to consider two further avenues.[10]
The first concerns our public sector bond holdings. Here our reasoning is very similar to that applied to our corporate bond holdings. Presently, most of our monetary policy assets are bonds issued by governments of EU Member States. However, the climate and nature-related risk intensity of these bonds is not obvious as there is currently no clear and reliable framework to assess their compatibility with the Paris Agreement. At the same time, since the pandemic, the universe of supranational bonds issued by EU institutions has increased significantly, with green bonds now making up a relatively large share.[11]In my view, when there is no clear monetary policy rationale for preferring domestic sovereign bonds, we should contemplate increasing the share of EU supranational bonds in our total bond holdings to minimise potential climate and nature-related risks and to better align our balance sheet with the general economic policies in the EU. This would be relevant if we had to consider new bond purchases in the future. But it is also relevant for the composition of the structural bond portfolio that will be part of our new operational framework, as announced earlier this year.[12]
Second, if there is a monetary policy need to reconsider targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) for banks in the future, there are compelling reasons to seriously consider greening these TLTROs. After all, the ECB has in the past adopted a similar approach by incorporating financial stability considerations into the design of its instruments. As of the third series, which was launched in 2019, the TLTROs featured a lending target that excluded housing loans to limit the risk of real estate bubbles forming.[13]Similar targeting strategies can be considered to support green lending or exclude non-green lending in the future, provided an efficient validation process can be found.
…and banking supervision
Let me move to the steps we are taking in banking supervision.
Since the ECB published a guide setting out our supervisory expectations for banks’ risk management practices in 2020, we have consistently taken climate and nature-related risks[14]into account in our supervision.[15]Our guide outlines the ECB’s understanding of the safe and prudent management of climate and nature-related risks under the current prudential framework. We have now carried out a number of supervisory exercises to assess banks’ approaches to managing these risks against our expectations. Following these horizontal exercises, we have repeatedly urged banks to ensure the sound management of climate and nature-related risks, using our expectations as a starting point. In other words, we expect banks to manage climate and nature-related risks just like any other material risk they are exposed to. Considering the requirements clearly set out in the Capital Requirements Directive as implemented into national law and the need for banks to implement a regular process for identifying all material risks, banks must ensure that practices are in place for the sound management of climate and nature-related risks. They must do so by the end of 2024, and we have also set interim deadlines for banks to remediate certain shortcomings related to the management of these risks. These deadlines were informed by what the banks themselves considered reasonable when we first started discussing climate and nature-related risk management with them.
However, our first two interim deadlines have now passed and a number of banks did not deliver. As a basic starting point for managing any type of risk, we asked banks to perform an adequate materiality assessment of the impact of climate and nature-related risks across their portfolio by March 2023. Almost a year ago – just over six months after that deadline expired – we announced that a number of banks had not yet satisfactorily delivered on this. Consequently, 28 banks received binding supervisory decisions. Out of those, 22 were told that if they didn’t remedy their shortcomings by a certain date, they would incur a periodic penalty payment for every day the bank remains in breach of the requirement. Encouragingly, most banks have now submitted a meaningful materiality assessment, which shows that our supervisory efforts have been effective in almost all cases. For the banks where this is not the case, the process is ongoing to determine whether penalties will be charged.
For the second interim deadline, we asked banks to clearly include climate- and nature-related risks in their governance, strategy and risk management by December 2023. As with the first interim deadline, most banks have made progress and frameworks for climate and nature-related risks are now broadly in place. This notwithstanding, weaknesses in banks’ practices remain and have been communicated in further feedback letters. In a small group of outliers, foundational elements for the adequate management of climate and nature-related risks are still missing. These banks are now receiving binding supervisory decisions outlining the potential of periodic penalty payments if they fail to timely deliver on the requirements.
To avoid any doubt, we will proceed in exactly the same way with respect to the third and final deadline at the end of this year. By then we want to see that banks’ risk management practices ensure the sound management of climate and nature-related risks across all areas of our supervisory expectations. Thereafter, banks will have to keep updating their practices in accordance with advances in data availability, methodologies and legislative and regulatory requirements. Banks need to ensure that their risk management practices are and continue to be commensurate with the magnitude of the climate and nature-related risks that they face. As supervisors it is our job to make sure they do. To achieve this, we will use – obviously always in a proportionate way – all supervisory instruments that we have at our disposal.
Conclusion
The impact of the climate and nature crises on the world and therefore also on the economy will become increasingly profound. While we should continue to push for an orderly and full transition, it is becoming increasingly likely that we will ultimately see a combination of disorderly transition and further increasing physical damages due to the climate and nature crises. It implies that the world in which we live and in which central banks and supervisors pursue their mandate will see a further increase in uncertainty.
The perhaps most renowned laboratory scientist in human history Marie Skłodowska-Curie once remarked that “nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood.” She went on to say that “now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” In light of the ongoing climate and nature crises I would add that now is the time to understand more, so that we can act. NGOs and academic think tanks play a critical role in advancing the frontier of our understanding and in pushing for action.
In the pursuit of their mandates, central banks and supervisors are forward-looking and science-based institutions. We have understood – eureka! – that the climate and nature crises require us to look further than ever before beyond our familiar horizon. We are learning to update our models and analytical tools with insights from academic areas beyond economics and finance. We are adapting our instruments to incorporate climate and nature-related considerations.
It is our task. It is our commitment. Because it is our mandate.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a lecture in memory of Walter Eucken
Freiburg, 2 October 2024
The euro area economy is stagnating. Over the past two years, real GDP has expanded, on average, by only 0.1% per quarter. Surveys among firms indicate that growth is likely to remain subdued during the second half of this year.
Weak growth reflects, to a large extent, the exceptional shocks that hit the euro area economy in recent years, most notably the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[1]
Another reason is the tightening of monetary policy. From late 2021 to the end of 2023, bank lending rates for house purchases by households increased from 1.3% to 4%, and those for corporate loans from 1.4% to 5.3%. Such levels had not been seen in more than a decade.
Dampening growth in aggregate demand was needed to restore price stability.
In 2021, when the euro area economy reopened in the pandemic and the economy’s supply capacity was still severely constrained, real private consumption rose by more than 8% in just two quarters. When we began to raise our key policy rates in July 2022, households and firms started to spend less and save more, thereby bringing supply and demand closer into balance.
Yet, although the peak impact of monetary tightening is likely to be behind us and real incomes are rising as inflation falls and wages increase, growth remains shallow. Over the past 18 months, the recovery has repeatedly been weaker than anticipated.
Aggregate growth figures mask, however, significant heterogeneity across euro area economies. Since interest rates started to rise, growth has become increasingly uneven (Slide 2).
In some Member States, such as Malta, Spain and Portugal, output has expanded measurably. In Malta, for example, annual real GDP growth has averaged 6% since 2022. In Spain and Portugal, real activity has grown by nearly 4% annually.
In fact, much of the euro area’s dismal growth performance since we started raising our key policy rates can be attributed to a small group of countries, including Germany, Finland and Estonia.
If one were to plot growth in the euro area excluding Germany, for example, activity in the currency area would have been remarkably resilient in the face of the sharpest monetary policy tightening in decades and a war raging at the EU’s doorstep. Only a few advanced economies, most notably the United States, have expanded at a faster pace during this period (Slide 3).
Monetary policy unlikely to be the key driver of heterogeneity
Monetary policy has probably been one factor contributing to heterogeneity in the euro area. An economy such as Germany’s, which is centred around a strong manufacturing base, is likely to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than more service-oriented economies.
Three observations suggest, however, that monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver of heterogeneity.
First, output in Germany had started to stagnate well before the rise in interest rates. At the end of 2021, real GDP was only 1% above its level four years earlier, against increases of 4.9% for the euro area excluding Germany and even 10% in the United States over the same period.
In other words, the growth gap was widening already well before we started tightening monetary policy.
Second, we observe significant heterogeneity even in parts of economic activity that are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In Germany, industrial production (excluding construction) is 10% lower today than it was before market interest rates started to rise in late 2021 – a considerably larger loss than that seen in most other economies (Slide 4, left-hand side).
This contrast becomes even starker when one considers the production of capital goods, which tend to be the most interest-rate sensitive.
Over the past two and a half years, the slowdown in the production of capital goods started earlier and was more pronounced in Germany than in other major euro area economies. Today, capital goods production in Germany is 3% lower than at the end of 2021. By contrast, it remained nearly 17% higher in the Netherlands over the same period (Slide 4, right-hand side).
Third, German households have, on aggregate, so far benefited from the rise in interest rates.
Since the end of 2021, their net interest income has increased sharply, as they shifted their savings into time deposits offering higher returns, while interest rates on long-running, fixed-rate mortgages remained low (Slide 5).
By contrast, the widespread prevalence of flexible-rate mortgages in Spain has led to a notable increase in interest payments that has more than offset the rise in income gained from higher interest rates on savings.
That is, the transmission of monetary policy through some channels, such as the mortgage channel, is likely to have been weaker, not stronger, in Germany than in other countries.
Resilient growth in the south of the euro area
To understand the main drivers behind the heterogeneity, it is necessary to look at both the countries that have grown faster than what might have been expected considering tight policy and those that have been underperforming.
Let me focus first on the more dynamic regions of the euro area.
In many cases, trade played an important role. In Spain, for example, net exports contributed, on average, around 0.4 percentage points to growth every quarter over the past two and a half years.
This is a notable increase from the period preceding the pandemic (Slide 6, left-hand side). The same broad pattern can be observed in Italy and Portugal.
A strong recovery in tourism after the pandemic has been a key factor supporting the rise in exports in these economies. But trade is not the whole story.
Labour market developments played an equally important role. Greece is the most remarkable case. Unemployment fell from 13.7% in early 2022 to 9.9% in July this year, a level not seen since the global financial crisis (Slide 6, right-hand side).
We observe similar improvements in labour markets across the south of the euro area. In Italy, for example, the number of people in employment has expanded by more than one million since 2022, measurably supporting private consumption and confidence.
Finally, in some countries fiscal policy remained more accommodative than in others. In Italy, the government deficit last year was 7.2%, compared with 2.6% in Germany.
Funds allocated under the Next Generation EU programme provided further impetus to growth and employment. In 2022 and 2023, 37% of the funds were allocated to the five fastest-growing countries although their share in the euro area’s economy accounted for only 13%.
All in all, in large parts of the single currency area, the impact of tighter monetary policy was weakened by a combination of looser fiscal policy and a shift in consumption towards services. In addition, some of these economies have gone some way towards becoming more resilient through structural reforms after the sovereign debt crisis, which helps explain their overperformance.
While some countries will need to adjust government spending to be in line with the new European fiscal rules, the gradual dialling back of monetary policy restraint since June, together with the continued rise in real incomes, is likely to support growth further over the medium term.
Structural headwinds in export-oriented countries
The gradual moderation in the degree of monetary policy restriction will also support growth in those parts of the euro area that have stagnated in recent years. Construction activity, for example, has contracted by 12% since 2022 in Finland and by nearly 7% in Germany.
While rising costs for equipment and raw materials contributed measurably to the drag in construction, the recent decline in mortgage rates is already translating into rising demand for housing.
A less restrictive policy stance may help reduce risks of negative growth spillovers from the core to the periphery. However, monetary policy is no panacea.
Germany, in particular, is currently facing strong headwinds that will not be resolved by lower interest rates alone. Its business model is built on export-driven growth, focusing on the high-end segment of traditional manufacturing industries.
From 2000 to 2015, Germany’s current account turned from a deficit of 1.8% of GDP to a surplus of 8.6% – an unparalleled surge among advanced economies (Slide 7, left-hand side). As a result, net exports accounted for almost one-third of growth over this period.
But on average since 2016, net exports have no longer been contributing to growth, with Germany losing export market shares at a concerning pace (Slide 7, right-hand side). And with domestic demand not stepping up, the German economy has been growing by just 1% on average per year over this period.
Of course, this needs to be seen in the context of the series of shocks in recent years. Germany’s growth outcomes were better than feared considering the sheer size of the energy shock. The swift reduction in gas consumption and the rapid switch to alternative energy sources in response to the sudden loss of access to Russian gas have demonstrated the adaptability of the German economy.[2]
And yet, Germany is facing deep-seated challenges.
In fact, the perils of relying on exports as a primary source of growth have long been known.
In the two decades up to the pandemic, euro area exporters – and German firms in particular – benefited from exceptionally strong growth in some key markets, especially in China, where a real estate boom fuelled demand for goods exports from the euro area, particularly for capital goods.[3]
ECB staff analysis shows that euro area firms would have lost export market shares at a much faster pace if it had not been for such geographical and sectoral effects, which largely offset parallel losses in price competitiveness related to higher energy and labour costs as well as weaker productivity growth (Slide 8, panel a).
But since the pandemic, competitiveness effects have started to dominate as the special factors boosting euro area exports have slowed, explaining the sizeable drop in export market shares (Slide 8, panel b).[4]
Export-led growth model may need adjustment
Part of the weakness in exports is likely to be cyclical, reflecting the lagged effects of global monetary policy tightening and the weakness in China.
But there is a risk that the pre-pandemic export-oriented growth model will face more permanent headwinds and require adjustment, for three main reasons.
First, the nature of globalisation is changing. Geoeconomic fragmentation is intensifying, with global trade measures increasing sharply, especially for critical raw materials – the production of which is often concentrated in just a few countries.
As such, the times when globalisation was boosting trade and growth may be behind us. There is evidence that geopolitics is increasingly hampering trade and that firms progressively seek to diversify their supply of strategic goods by sourcing them from producers in geopolitically aligned countries.[5]
Given that euro area firms are more deeply integrated into global value chains than many of their competitors, fragmentation could hurt the euro area economy more than others.[6]
Second, the energy shock was a major driver behind the decline in euro area market shares.
Unlike past oil price shocks, which affected firms across the globe, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sharp spike in gas prices, was a massive competitiveness shock for the euro area, as the input costs of domestic exporters rose sharply relative to those of their competitors.
As a result, the exports of energy-intensive sectors decreased strongly, accounting for almost the entire decline in total exports in 2023 (Slide 9, left-hand side).[7]
ECB staff analysis shows that, at the peak of the European gas crisis, the average impact on euro area export market shares was a decline of 7%, with energy-intensive industries experiencing losses of more than 15% in export market shares (Slide 9, right-hand side).
Although energy costs have fallen from their peak, they remain almost four times as high as in the United States (Slide 10, left-hand side). Energy will therefore likely remain a drag on euro area price competitiveness.
Third, competition is changing.
Two decades ago, Chinese firms specialised mainly in the production of low-value goods, such as clothing, footwear or plastic. Today, China is increasingly building up large production capacities in high-value-added industries, such as the automotive and specialised machinery sectors.
China moving up in the value chain is not only directly dampening demand for euro area goods – it is also turning China into a fierce competitor in third markets.
This is particularly visible in Germany and Italy, which over the past two decades have seen a steady increase in the number of sectors in which these economies and China have a revealed comparative advantage – meaning they export more in these sectors than the global average (Slide 10, right-hand side).
With Chinese and euro area firms increasingly competing in similar export markets, China’s significant gains in price competitiveness vis-à-vis the euro area are weighing on euro area exports.
Since 2021, China has accounted for the entire appreciation in real effective exchange rate of the euro based on producer prices (Slide 11, left-hand side). While euro area producer prices have increased significantly, Chinese producer prices have remained remarkably stable over the past four years (Slide 11, right-hand side).
On the one hand, this is the result of generous state subsidies that are significantly higher than in most other advanced and major emerging market economies (Slide 12, left-hand side).[8]
On the other hand, rising overcapacities are weighing on Chinese export prices.[9]The automotive sector is a case in point. China is making significant upfront investments in production and transport to boost its export capacity.
Orders for new shipping vessels are projected to raise the number of electric vehicles available for exports by 1.7 million annually by 2026 (Slide 12, right-hand side). To put this in perspective, the total number of electric vehicles sold across the EU in 2023 was 2.5 million.
Need for a reform agenda putting innovation and entrepreneurship first
Europe, and Germany in particular, needs to adapt to this new environment. At a time when global economic relationships are becoming more uncertain, Europe needs to regain its competitiveness to protect its standard of living and social values.
Past efforts to regain competitiveness were not without shortcomings. Policies aimed at reducing wage costs, for example, often came with significant economic hardship and social costs.
Today, the focus needs to be a different one. Europe should put innovation and entrepreneurship at the heart of its agenda.
In his recent report, Mario Draghi presents a candid and unsparing diagnosis of the state of the euro area economy and makes many useful proposals.[10]
Some of those proposals are unlikely to find broad support among political leaders. But it would be wrong to reduce the report to a call for more joint borrowing, which in any case should only be discussed after evaluating the experience with the Recovery and Resilience Facility.
In fact, many reforms that can foster European competitiveness do not need significant upfront investment, nor do they require changes to the EU Treaty.
Let me highlight three areas that I consider most promising.
Creating a European Silicon Valley
First, Europe needs to facilitate the birth and growth of innovative start-ups.
Since 2000, productivity per hour worked has increased by just 0.8% per year on average – only half the growth seen in the United States (Slide 13). European firms’ failure to reap the efficiency gains brought about by information and communication technologies is one of the root causes.[11]
Europe is not short on innovation potential. But its regulatory framework and the lack of deep capital markets make it difficult for young firms to thrive.
Over the past decade, European start-ups have raised funds equivalent to just 0.3% of GDP from venture capital investments, less than a third of the figure for the United States.[12]Banks do not have the risk-bearing capacity to fill this void, and this would not change even if we managed to revive securitisation in the euro area.
Today, many promising start-ups shift their operations overseas because of a lack of risk capital. In 2022, 58 founders of “unicorns” in the United States – start-ups that went on to be valued over USD 1 billion – had been born in the euro area.
If Europe wants to retain such potential, it needs to make private equity investments more attractive, including by removing the “debt bias” in national tax systems.
Better mobilisation of capital is one way to foster innovation. Strengthening the Single Market, fostering competition and cutting red tape is another.
The European economy remains segmented along national borders, torn between different rules and legal systems. This makes it difficult for young firms to grow into sufficient size and form innovation clusters, so that new ideas and technologies can spread faster and allow them to compete in an environment where “the winner takes most”.
The Single Market is Europe’s most effective tool to mobilise economies of scale and to enable the creation of a European Silicon Valley. However, the level of European integration remains disappointingly low – especially in services, which amount to around 67% of the EU’s GDP. Intra-EU trade in services accounts for only about 15% of GDP, compared with close to 50% for goods.
To a significant extent, this reflects regulatory and administrative barriers to doing business in the euro area that hold back competition and thus innovation.
Green innovation as an engine of growth
Second, Europe needs to leverage the green transition.
Making the European economies more sustainable is not a choice. Weather-related disasters are becoming more frequent and more severe, which requires urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the growing impact of climate change.
Embracing the green transition comes with costs for society. Relative price changes are often most painful for those who can least afford it. But the green transition also offers the potential to unlock economic opportunities, especially for those moving first.
This is the spirit of the Porter hypothesis – the view that environmental measures can be an important driver of innovation.[13]Although controversial, there is ample evidence in favour of the Porter hypothesis.
Consider the automotive industry.
Euro area car producers have lost export market share over the past few years (Slide 14, left-hand side). But these losses were largely confined to the combustion engine segment – in the electric car industry, euro area firms made considerable gains, also by developing hybrid technologies early.
These gains were made possible by significant investments in research and development. According to the most recent data, automotive companies in the euro area still boasted the world’s largest investments in research and development in 2022, about twice as much as the United States and China.
The green industry, including low-emission car production, is the only innovative sector where the EU is currently leading in terms of the number of patents (Slide 14, right-hand side).
Technological leadership also allowed euro area firms to raise their export prices on motor vehicles more than others, benefiting from a relatively price-inelastic demand (Slide 15, left-hand side).[14]As a result, gross value added was typically more resilient than industrial production, as firms moved into higher-margin activities (Slide 15, right-hand side).
In other words, Europe has invested more than other countries in being a frontrunner in the green transition. Now is not the time to backtrack. Europe needs to continue investing in green technologies and innovations to turn the green transition into an engine of growth.
The sooner Europe decarbonises its energy consumption, the faster it will reduce its dependency on foreign suppliers and regain price competitiveness, because the marginal cost of renewable energies is practically zero.
This is all the more important in times of the artificial intelligence revolution, which will significantly increase the demand for energy. At the same time, the adoption of new energy sources, such as hydrogen, may require a transition phase during which not all hydrogen can be generated from renewable energies.
Managing the green transition requires both private and public investments. To foster this process, a mission-oriented industrial policy may be needed that strategically focuses on achieving the green transition through coordinated efforts and thus reduces uncertainty.[15]
For example, last year France introduced new criteria for granting subsidies to purchase electric vehicles, which privilege supply chains that are entirely green. As China’s electric vehicle industry relies heavily on coal-generated electricity, these criteria implicitly favour European production.[16]
Significant private and public investments are also needed to upgrade Europe’s electricity grid and to build new infrastructure, such as pipelines or networks of fuel stations for hydrogen, and these investments need to happen soon if Europe wants to be a leader in new technologies.
The scale of these investments may require new financing ideas. Their costs, and the uncertainty about future payoffs, are often so large that they may not break even over conventional investment horizons.
So, in some cases the resulting risks cannot be borne by entrepreneurs alone, making public-private partnerships a viable option to internalise the externalities arising from climate change. In some cases, this could include exploring options of granting state guarantees as a way for governments to incentivise private firms to invest in green infrastructure and technologies.
Higher labour participation and immigration are indispensable to address labour scarcity
Third, Europe needs to address labour scarcity.
Longer life expectancy and declining fertility will lead to a sharp drop in the euro area’s working-age population and a significant increase in the old-age dependency ratio. These developments are most concerning in Italy, where the share in the total population of those aged between 15 and 64 is projected to fall from about 63% today to 55% by 2050 (Slide 16, left-hand side).
Over the past ten years, these strains have partly been cushioned by immigration. But as the baby boomer generation is retiring and migration is expected to moderate, the drag on growth coming from an ageing population is likely to be significant.
New research suggests that, over the next two decades, demographic change may lower annual per capita output growth by more than one percentage point in Italy and by 0.8 percentage points in Germany.[17]
This comes at a time when a considerable share of firms across the euro area are already reporting acute shortages of labour limiting their business (Slide 16, right-hand side). Despite declining somewhat recently, this share has never been higher than in recent years.
Labour scarcity cuts across society. In many countries, thousands of teacher vacancies are not filled, especially for STEM subjects. There are chronic staff shortages in hospitals and nursing homes.
And all countries are facing a lack of skilled workers in specialised industries. These shortages are likely to dramatically increase as demographic change proceeds and cannot be offset by rising productivity alone.
Europe should therefore do four things to address labour scarcity.
First, it should further increase labour force participation. Significant progress has been made in recent decades, especially by bringing more women and older workers into the labour force. But participation rates remain below those in some other advanced economies.
Second, resources need to be allocated more efficiently. The public sector has played an important role in explaining total employment growth over the past few years.[18]The health crisis in particular has made some of these developments necessary. But the larger the public sector becomes, the less human capital is available for private firms to expand their productive businesses.
Third, Europe needs to strengthen education. In many euro area countries, a significant share of adults – in some cases more than a third – have not completed upper secondary school. Supporting education will not only unlock the benefits of new technologies. It will also work against demographic headwinds, as higher levels of education tend to lead to higher labour market participation.[19]
Last, Europe needs to attract foreign workers. Solutions are needed for how to make immigration socially acceptable and how to promote the flow of workers across the single currency area.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In recent years, growth in the euro area has become increasingly uneven. While monetary policy may have contributed to rising heterogeneity, it is not the main driver. Rather, structural headwinds are holding back growth in some countries more than in others.
We cannot ignore the headwinds to growth. With signs of softening labour demand and further progress in disinflation, a sustainable fall of inflation back to our 2% target in a timely manner is becoming more likely, despite still elevated services inflation and strong wage growth.
At the same time, monetary policy cannot resolve structural issues.
European governments have a historic responsibility to turn the current challenges into opportunities. Europe has demonstrated in the past that it can adjust and rebound when faced with adversity.
Escaping stagnation requires forceful action at both national and European level. It requires putting innovation and entrepreneurship first by promoting competition and business dynamism.
This means strengthening the Single Market, improving access to private equity capital and reducing burdensome bureaucracy. It means leveraging the green transition to advance innovation and regain price competitiveness. And it means putting in place policies that incentivise labour participation and preserve a skilled workforce through immigration and education.
In all these ways, we can make the euro area stronger.
Thank you."

Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Latvijas Banka and SUERF Economic Conference 2024
Riga, 2 October 2024
It is a pleasure to talk to you today about reviving productivity growth in the euro area – a critical challenge that demands urgent attention and collective action.
The euro area’s economic recovery
I would like to start by outlining recent economic developments.
After more than a year of stagnation, economic activity in the euro area recovered mildly in the first half of 2024, with considerable variation across countries and sectors. Growth, however, was weaker than expected in the second quarter of the year. The euro area growth outlook was revised down in September, compared with the June Eurosystem staff projections, with risks to growth remaining tilted to the downside. Looking ahead, we expect the recovery to strengthen over time, as rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support consumption and investment. Exports should also continue contributing to the recovery as global demand picks up.
The recovery should be underpinned by an expected recovery in productivity growth, which has been particularly weak since the onset of the pandemic. Weak labour productivity can be partly attributed to cyclical factors, especially given the relative rigidity of the euro area labour market, where employers do not fully adjust their workforce at times of low growth, resulting in labour hoarding.[1]Cyclical factors that incentivise labour hoarding are expected to gradually diminish, leading to a recovery in productivity.
However, productivity growth has not only been dampened through cyclical channels. It has been decelerating for decades in the euro area, mirroring a broader global trend. This structural weakness has been a significant drag on economic activity and continues to constrain medium-term growth prospects in the euro area, particularly in light of demographic developments. The population is shrinking and our societies are ageing, so sustaining the workforce will rely on higher participation rates, especially among women and older people, alongside well-designed immigration policies to address labour shortages and support long-term growth.
But allow me to delve deeper into the core drivers of this sluggish productivity growth, particularly when compared with the United States.
The productivity gap and how to address it
Over the past 30 years, the productivity gap between the euro area and the United States has widened considerably. This divergence has been driven by relatively weak total factor productivity growth in the euro area and, since the global financial crisis, insufficient capital deepening.
To understand this productivity gap, we must look at the structural challenges we face.
As Mario Draghi highlighted in his recent report on European competitiveness, one key issue is that Europe largely missed out on the digital revolution.[2]While the United States capitalised on its high-tech sector, many of the euro area’s most productive “frontier” firms are concentrated in mid-tech sectors with limited potential for productivity growth. This divergence is not due to the level of public R&D expenditure or the quality of our research, but rather to sectoral specialisation and the lack of coordination in investment and innovation policies across Member States.[3]
Total investment ratios, both private and public, as a percentage of GDP are also lower in the euro area than in the United States.[4]Despite an increase in public investment since 2020, driven by the Next Generation EU initiative, there is still a substantial gap in private investment, particularly in the areas of R&D, digital innovation and digital uptake.
The decline in total factor productivity growth among high-tech frontier firms in the euro area partly reflects their age, as older firms are typically less productive. Moreover, a secular decline in business entry rates and the winner-takes-all dynamics of new technologies have reduced competition, limiting the process of creative destruction needed for productivity growth. In the services sector, a widening total factor productivity growth gap between leading and lagging firms suggests that the adoption of new technologies by non-frontier firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, remains sluggish.
The European ecosystem of small and ageing firms struggles to compete globally. If we do not act quickly, their comparative disadvantages will only grow in this era of rapid technological progress. Our firms face scaling-up challenges, skill shortages, and framework conditions that are not conducive to radical innovation, but instead favour marginal improvements in mature technologies.
Business dynamism is stifledby intricate regulations and overlapping governmental institutions and tax systems. This restricts the creation of innovative firms and the reallocation of resources to the most productive, undermining productivity growth and competitiveness. These complexities are amplified across national borders, further limiting the ability of European businesses to scale up.[5]
Ensuring a Single Market that’s fit for purpose
Europe’s productivity would be higher if more innovative firms had a better environment in which to become established, grow, innovate and thrive. Since its inception, the Single Market has made significant progress in fostering growth and convergence across Europe, but the environment for innovative firms still leaves much to be desired.[6]
Enrico Letta’s recent report offers a comprehensive perspective on the Single Market, highlighting the as yet untapped potential.[7]His proposals to streamline the regulatory burdens, favour regulations instead of directives for greater harmonisation, improve administrative capacity and introduce a European business code as a 28th regime merit particular attention.
Advancing the capital markets union
A larger and more integrated Single Market would call for a single, deep capital market to finance the EU’s competitive firms. Greater economic integration in the EU will bring greater financial integration. Numerous proposals have been made to develop the capital markets union, and the ECB’s Governing Council issued a statement on the topic in March 2024.[8]Let me first focus on the proposals aimed at fostering the growth of competitive European firms.
As companies progress from developing an idea to becoming large and successful enterprises, they require diverse sources of financing and need to be connected to stakeholders who can best support them through their growth phases. However, Europe’s financial system is predominantly reliant on bank lending, which is not ideally suited for financing young high-risk firms. During the scaling-up phase in particular, innovative companies need access to risk capital and investors with the networks, experience and risk tolerance to allow them to experiment and potentially fail. Venture capital funds are particularly well-suited for this purpose.
However, the venture capital market segment in Europe is underdeveloped. As a percentage of GDP, venture capital financing in Europe is a third of that in the United States.[9]In addition, individual EU venture capital funds are smaller owing to a fragmented market. This has direct consequences for firms: not many EU venture capital funds are large enough or have deep enough pockets to meet firms’ financing needs or cope with the high failure rate of start-ups or young high-risk firms. It is not uncommon to see failure rates of 80% for risky frontier-tech investments, for example.[10]
If firms need to seek funding in countries outside the EU, such as the United States, their activities can end up being relocated abroad, affecting Europe’s economy. Companies that source foreign funding in the later stages of their scaling-up may then be listed on foreign exchanges, further depriving Europe’s equity markets of large and innovative firms that contribute to the markets’ depth and liquidity. The recent listing gap between the United States and Europe is due, at least in part, to the greater attractiveness of US stock markets for foreign firms. The percentage of foreign companies among all companies listed in the United States rose from around 18% in 2017 to 24% in 2022. By contrast, foreign listings in European markets have shown a slight downward trend over the same period.[11]
Europe lacks a single, sufficiently deep and liquid equity market where firms listing in the EU could aim for similarly high valuations as those they can currently aspire to in the United States. The average market capitalisation of US companies has historically been much higher than that of European companies, with the gap having widened significantly since 2010. In 2022, US companies achieved, on average, a market capitalisation that was 3.3 times higher than that of EU companies.[12]
Overall, Europe’s underdeveloped venture capital environment, fragmented equity markets and heterogenous national markets are leading to higher financing costs and inefficiencies in the allocation of capital when compared with the United States. To overcome Europe’s private investment gap and give European firms access to the financing they need, especially in terms of equity, we need a more ambitious agenda for both developing and integrating EU capital markets.
First, household savings should be directed towards capital markets. A retail savings product that offers tax incentives and could be sold across the EU would be a step forward. The same goes for lowering the entry barriers for retail investors to participate in equity and bond markets. Increasing the share of equity investments in funded pension systems would also have mutually reinforcing benefits. It would give institutional investors, such as pension funds, a greater role in providing a large investor base for equity markets, similar to the role they now play in the United States.[13]Ensuring the portability of pensions across borders, as envisaged when launching the Pan-European Personal Pension Product, will also be fundamental in supporting the single labour market by enhancing mobility for workers in Europe.
Second, regulatory action can encourage investment in equity by addressing the debt-equity bias in taxation. Simplifying regulation can attract investors, promote risk-taking by Europe’s companies and boost cross-border market developments. For instance, streamlining eligibility requirements in the UCITS[14]and European Venture Capital Fund[15]directives could incentivise investment in venture capital funds and make the most of the “passport” system that facilitates the distribution of funds throughout the EU.
Third, to develop the equity market, we need to make listings in Europe more attractive and efficient. To this end, we should aim to create a single pool of liquidity for public equity markets that would provide sufficient market depth to issuers and investors, including asset managers, pension funds and other large EU-based investors.[16]This requires (i) deeper integration in the trading and post-trading landscape; (ii) further harmonisation in difficult areas like insolvency regimes, accounting, and securities law; and (iii) more centralised supervision for systemic cross-border entities, including stock exchanges and market infrastructures. Where political agreement on harmonisation is not yet reachable, intermediate solutions mentioned before, such as a 28th regime, or enhanced cooperation, should be considered.
A way of deepening the securitisation market would be to set up a European securitisation platform. Besides fostering standardisation, this would support the development of green and other strategic segments while maintaining a sound prudential framework. Finally, public-private partnerships will be critical in future for stepping up investment in innovative firms and the green and digital transitions.
Mobilising EU-level financing for the provision of European public goods
The complementarity between public and private investment leads me to my final point on the need to mobilise fiscal resources at EU level.
The EU needs a massive amount of financing to close the productivity gap and support the digital and green transition.[17]Europe has to reflect on how it can use targeted public investment to help meet these financing needs. The EU and Member States should explore a reorientation of the EU budget as well as options for jointly funding investment in specific projects.
The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) was a step in the right direction. Joint European action can successfully bring about key investments as well as growth-enhancing structural reforms, while fostering national ownership, mitigating fragmentation risks, enhancing economic resilience and improving risk sharing. But the RRF is a temporary tool, and once it elapses in 2026, the EU budget will shrink significantly owing to the cliff effect.[18]
We should be determined to permanently enhance the EU’s fiscal capacity, also to support cross-border and pan-European projects. These could include the provision of European public goods such as energy infrastructure, innovative technologies and common defence, further strengthening risk sharing by ensuring that key investments take place even in adverse macroeconomic conditions.[19]Besides common spending initiatives, essential elements for supporting innovative projects are well-targeted subsidies and a cohesive European industrial policy.[20]A level playing field needs to be restored, fully phasing out the State Aid Temporary Framework adopted during the pandemic.
Conclusion
Let me conclude. Broadly speaking, the problems we are discussing today derive from the incompleteness of the Economic and Monetary Union: greater integration in the markets for goods and services, as well as in the capital and labour factors of production, are essential for the success of the European project.
The recent high-level reports from Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi correctly emphasise that the key to Europe’s success is to leverage on all aspects of EU collaboration and coordination, including the completion of the Single Market. This would boost EU productivity and competitiveness for the benefit of our economies and citizens.
Regarding the topic of today’s conference, advancing on the agenda for the capital markets union will require efforts to dismantle the barriers to enlarging segments of the capital markets and provide the financing needed by innovative firms to develop throughout their lifecycle.
But the capital markets union alone will not deliver those benefits if economic integration is still in the starting blocks, the Single Market remains fragmented, the banking union is not yet complete, and EU industrial competition and trade policies are not part of an overall EU strategy. This calls for an ambitious and comprehensive agenda with a more focused Europe. To reignite European productivity and competitiveness, ensure sustainable growth and rising living standards for all European citizens, the EU response must be determined and cohesive."

Welcome address by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 5th joint ECB, Bank of Canada and Federal Reserve Bank of New York Conference on expectations surveys, central banks and the economy
Frankfurt am Main, 1 October 2024
It is my pleasure to welcome you to this fifth joint conference on expectations surveys organised by the European Central Bank, the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
In my remarks today, I will delve into the fascinating world of expectations surveys and their relevance to central banks. I will review how useful expectations surveys have proven to be for central banks over the period since 2019, the year we held our first conference in this series. In addition, I will touch on the challenges facing central banks in using surveys. The fact that central banks generally operate under great uncertainty has come to the fore over the past five years. Today, too, we are facing huge uncertainty – not least in view of the many prevailing economic, financial and geopolitical risks. Yet, it is precisely in this unpredictable and highly complex landscape that surveys have come into their own.
The return of survey expectations
Over the past decade, central banks and other policymaking institutions have invested significantly in expectations surveys and have drawn increasingly on survey data for their policy analysis and research. These surveys cover consumers, firms, financial market participants and other experts, including professional forecasters. At the ECB, we can fortunately look to a wide array of such surveys covering diverse topics such as consumer expectations, household finance and consumption, access to finance of enterprises, the payment attitudes of consumers and bank lending. Since 2013, the ECB has also conducted a survey of wholesale market participants on credit terms and conditions, and it recently developed a new survey of monetary analysts to collect expert expectations about key monetary policy parameters and concepts. Finally, the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters was launched back in 1999 at the start of Economic and Monetary Union. Its structured collection of data has supported a rich research programme investigating economic forecasts and expert expectations.[1]
All ECB surveys can provide insights into how different economic agents form and update their expectations. They can reveal the potential biases in these expectations and the extent to which expectations feed into economic decisions. Surveys were indeed quite central to the economic debate in the 1950s and the 1960s but their role became more marginal when rational expectations were incorporated into economic modelling in the 1970s. Over the past ten years, however, economists have seen survey expectations clearly returning to the mainstream.[2]One could describe the recent growth in survey-based research as a “counter-revolution” following the earlier “revolution” centred on rational expectations. Today, while models based on rational expectations still form a useful reference point in our analysis and research, they are no longer thought to provide a solid basis for understanding business cycles, for gauging the risks of financial crises or for designing effective economic policies. The central insight gained from this new line of survey-based research is that many economic agents may systematically form expectations by using partial sets of information or by following subjective narratives about how the economy functions – for example by applying simple rules of thumb.[3]It is important to understand such subjective expectations, because these beliefs often underlie the economic choices and financial decisions that drive the economy.[4]
Surveys have repeatedly proven their usefulness over the past five years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they were especially useful in helping to track financial conditions for firms and households, as well as in estimating the labour market response to the pandemic shock. Online surveys were of great benefit during the pandemic as in-person survey interviews were hampered by lockdown restrictions. For example, the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey – an online survey which was fortuitously launched in early 2020 – helped us understand the severity of the pandemic-induced collapse in consumption and gauge the overall effectiveness of the major policy interventions by governments and other authorities at the time.[5]
Insights from surveys during the recent period of high inflation
More recently, the data collected in surveys strongly supported the analysis of the recent inflationary episode in the euro area.[6]During the early phase of the inflation surge in 2022, survey data helped to inform the central discussion on the likely persistence of the shock. For example, the observed increase in consumers’ medium-term expectations may have interacted with an increase in firms’ pricing power to make the original supply shocks more persistent than they would otherwise have been.[7]
Forces that would gradually help bring inflation back down to our target were also visible in more recent survey data. For example, we could see how the rise in inflation and inflation expectations was acting as a major constraint on demand and consumer spending owing to its impact on real incomes. In August 2023 respondents to the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey were asked what actions they were planning to take in light of their expectations about future inflation. The results clearly showed that a much higher share of consumers planned to reduce their spending in response to the expectations of higher prices.[8]In addition, consumers indicated that they would start to shop around more and buy cheaper varieties of goods and services than they normally would. In a context where the ECB was taking decisive monetary policy action aimed at restoring price stability, these behavioural responses to higher inflation expectations also contributed to the gradual unwinding of the inflationary pressures across the euro area economy.
Insights for financial stability analysis
In addition to monetary policy, expectations surveys are now increasingly being used for other central bank tasks as well. This includes financial stability analysis. Here, surveys can help identify potential sources of financial risk not only in financial markets and the banking system, but also in the household and non-financial corporate sectors.[9]Even when there is no discernible financial stress at the aggregate level, the disaggregated or individual-level data typically provided by surveys can help us to identify emerging risks across particular sectors or socio-demographic groups.
In financial stability analysis, the topic of financial literacy is receiving increased attention. In the first keynote lecture of the conference, Professor Annamaria Lusardi from Stanford University will talk about why financial literacy is relevant for central banks. One consideration for financial stability analysis is that less financially literate households may be less prepared to cope with adverse economic and financial shocks. Yet, these households tend to be the most exposed to such shocks and more heavily affected when they occur. Policies seeking to boost financial literacy may help borrowers to source loans that are cheaper to service, thus promoting more efficient and more sustainable debt management. These issues may be particularly relevant for real estate markets and housing, which will be the focus of the second keynote lecture of the conference, given by Professor Tarun Ramadorai from Imperial College London. Professor Ramadorai will discuss the importance of non-rational beliefs in the housing market and how household surveys can help inform policies that can address these frictions.
Sustaining the quality and representativeness of surveys
Our experiences with survey data also highlight the challenges that policymakers face when using these data. Survey data can be volatile and there is evidence of overreaction in both household and firm surveys of expectations. For this reason, surveys may provide a noisy signal for policymaking in practice, which complicates how these data should feed into the policy reaction function. In this respect, I hope the research presented at today’s conference can also help policymakers distinguish the signal from the noise that is always embedded in expectations data. These considerations underline the importance of the quality of the survey design, including the sampling and data collection methods. It is crucial that questions are designed to avoid the framing of responses and that the complexity of the questionnaires is managed appropriately to avoid survey fatigue, which may negatively affect data quality. As central banks are making increasing use of survey data, they need to continuously and carefully monitor these data to ensure responses remain representative of the underlying population’s beliefs and behaviour.
Conclusion
Let me conclude. Today, expectations surveys are an important part of the toolkit available to central banks for their policy analysis. These surveys reveal insights about the economy that would otherwise remain hidden from view. As a result, they can contribute to more robust policy decisions and better policy assessments.
I would like to finish by thanking the presenters and participants in advance for their contributions and the conference organisers for putting together such an impressive programme. I wish you all a productive and successful two days of lively debate and discussion. I am confident that the insights that will emerge from sharing our experiences of different surveys across many countries and institutions will ultimately enhance the way in which we use expectations surveys to help guide policy decisions."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 30 September 2024
It is a great pleasure to return to this Committee for the first time since the European elections. I very much look forward to my exchanges with all of you, new and not-so-new members, over the course of this parliamentary term.
First, let me congratulate each of you on your election to this Parliament. Europe faces significant challenges, and critical decisions will need to be taken over the next five years. Your work will be crucial in guiding us forward.
As Members of the European Parliament, you play an essential role in channelling citizens’ questions and concerns about the ECB’s policies. I am committed to maintaining an open dialogue with you, building on the positive and constructive relationship between our two institutions. By working together, we can fulfil our joint accountability obligations under the Treaty and build trust in the ECB.
In my remarks today, I will start by providing an update on the euro area’s economic outlook and the ECB’s monetary policy stance, the first topic you have selected for today’s hearing. I will then discuss the need to advance the capital markets union – the second topic you have chosen.
Economic activity has recovered slowly since the end of the pandemic. The post-pandemic reopening allowed the euro area economy to grow during the first nine months of 2022, but economic activity broadly stagnated thereafter. This was due, among other factors, to the energy price shock following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the increased geopolitical uncertainty, but also to the tightening of our monetary policy.
Growth resumed in early 2024. The euro area economy grew by 0.2% in the second quarter, after 0.3% in the first quarter. However, growth in the second quarter stemmed mainly from exports and government consumption. Domestic demand remained weak as households consumed less, firms cut business investment and housing investment dropped. The services sector is holding up, with signs of deceleration, while activity in the manufacturing and construction sectors remains subdued.
Looking ahead, the suppressed level of some survey indicators suggests that the recovery is facing headwinds. We expect the recovery to strengthen over time, as rising real incomes should allow households to consume more. The latest ECB staff projections foresee the economy growing by 0.8% in 2024, 1.3% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026.
The labour market remains resilient, with the unemployment rate standing at 6.4% in July – broadly unchanged over the past year. At the same time, employment growth slowed to just 0.2% in the second quarter, and recent indicators point to a further deceleration in the coming quarters. According to ECB staff, the unemployment rate is projected to remain around its current low level.
Turning to price developments, disinflation has been accelerating over the last two months. Headline inflation fell to 2.2% in August 2024 and is expected to drop further in September, mainly on account of falling energy costs. Core inflation – excluding energy and food – edged down to 2.8% in August driven by a decline in goods inflation that outweighed an increase in services inflation.
The indicator of domestic inflation, which only includes items with a low import intensity, remained high in August as wages continued to grow at an elevated pace. At the same time, the overall growth in labour costs has been moderating in recent quarters, and profits have been buffering the impact of higher wages on inflation.
Looking ahead, inflation might temporarily increase in the fourth quarter of this year as previous sharp falls in energy prices drop out of the annual rates, but the latest developments strengthen our confidence that inflation will return to target in a timely manner. We will take that into account in our next monetary policy meeting in October. The ECB staff projections from September foresee inflation to average 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026.
Let me now turn to our monetary policy stance – the first topic chosen for today’s hearing.
We have come a long way in the fight against inflation. In October 2022 inflation peaked at 10.6%. By September 2023, the last time we raised interest rates, it had dropped by more than half, to 5.2%. The decline in inflation and the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations showed that our strong response was bearing fruit. Then, after nine months of holding rates steady, we saw inflation halve again to 2.6% in June when we started lowering interest rates.
The new data available at the time of the September Governing Council meeting reinforced our confidence in the timely return of inflation to our 2% target. We therefore lowered the rate on the deposit facility, which is the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance, by another 25 basis points to 3.5%.
We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, focusing on the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Policy rates will be kept sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve our aim. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
Moreover, as we announced on 13 March 2024, some changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy took effect from 18 September.[1]In particular, the spread between the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the deposit facility rate was set at 15 basis points. The aim is to steer short-term money market rates more closely in line with monetary policy decisions.
In parallel to our policy deliberations, we have also launched an assessment of our monetary policy strategy. This assessment will be more limited in scope than our last review, which we completed in July 2021, and will include two work streams. One work stream will focus on the changed inflation environment and the other on the implications for our monetary policy strategy, including what we can learn from the periods of both low and high inflation.
We expect to conclude the assessment in the second half of 2025 and I intend to keep you informed in our regular hearings and interactions.
Let me now turn to the second topic of this hearing – the capital markets union.
The ECB has long emphasised the need for progress in this area to integrate our fragmented markets and thus foster risk diversification and shock absorption across the EU. Doing so would support financial stability and facilitate the transmission of monetary policy.
But a deep and integrated single market for capital is also essential for achieving some of the EU’s other key goals, from financing the green and digital transitions to enabling savers to earn higher returns. Additionally, young and innovative firms need to grow and become more productive, which will ultimately benefit all Europeans. For the time being, however, a lack of access to equity financing is a key factor holding these firms back.
Advancing the capital markets union must therefore be a cornerstone of the EU’s competitiveness strategy.
Significant efforts have been made over the past decade to move forwards, and I want to pay tribute to the role the European Parliament has played in promoting an ambitious, European approach. But vested interests and competing national priorities have hampered progress.
Now, at the beginning of a new legislative term, we are at a crossroads. The current political momentum needs to be converted into a concrete agenda with clear priorities. And this agenda must be swiftly followed up with genuine actions.
The ECB’s Governing Council laid out its priorities for European capital markets in a statement in March.[2]Let me highlight three key areas where progress is essential.
First, we must improve the way we save in Europe. In 2022, European household savings exceeded EUR 1.1 trillion.[3]However, around a third of these savings are held in deposits[4]– significantly more than in the United States. Mobilizing even a small portion of these funds and investing them in European capital markets could greatly contribute to the more than EUR 700 billion needed annually to achieve the EU’s key strategic objectives. This is also likely to provide better long-term returns for our citizens while improving European companies' access to equity finance.
Second, we need a single regulatory and supervisory ecosystem that promotes market integration.
And third, for EU capital markets to be more attractive to investors and issuers, they need to achieve greater scale and depth. This can only happen through integration – especially in our trading and post-trading infrastructure.
To conclude – the world is changing rapidly, and Europe is falling behind.
The diagnosis and the remedy are clear – the EU must come together and address its structural challenges to increase its competitiveness.
Advancing the capital markets union is an important part of this agenda, but not the only one. Significant efforts to boost Europe’s economic resilience and decarbonise the economy will also be needed. This will require substantial investment in the coming years, which needs to come from both private and public sources.
Progress in these areas will not only enhance Europe’s ability to withstand future economic shocks, but also help the ECB to maintain price stability.
As Jacques Chirac once observed, “The construction of Europe is an art. It is the art of the possible.”
This Parliament has found ways to push Europe forwards before, and I trust you will do so again. The future of Europe is in your hands.
Thank you for your attention – I look forward to your questions and to engaging with you throughout what will be a decisive period for Europe."

Keynote speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Economics of Payments XIII Conference organised by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank
Vienna, 27 September 2024
Money plays a fundamental role in society, driving economic activity and enabling daily transactions.[1]Money in physical form, cash, remains the most frequently used means of payment in stores, especially for lower value transactions. But more and more people are using money in digital form. An average of 379 million retail transactions are made digitally in the euro area every day.[2]
Given money’s importance for our material and social well-being, the regulation of money has long been considered a cornerstone of state sovereignty. As the influential French jurist and political philosopher Jean Bodin observed in the 16th century, ""only he who has the power to make law can regulate the coinage.""[3]
Today, legislators continue to regulate the use of money and they have entrusted central banks with issuing public money and maintaining confidence in the monetary system.
At the European Central Bank (ECB), we issue money that can be used to settle wholesale and retail transactions throughout the euro area, thereby guaranteeing the singleness of money across the monetary union. And we ensure that the euro remains a safe, stable and effective medium of exchange and store of value. This provides an essential anchor for the economy and the financial system.
The Eurosystem has made significant progress in integrating wholesale transactions, largely thanks to the robust payment infrastructure it provides. The Eurosystem’s real-time gross settlement system T2, for instance, processes a value close to the entire euro area GDP on a weekly basis, and it has established itself as a leading global payment system.
In parallel, euro banknotes are accepted for retail payments across the euro area. They have become a symbol of European integration and freedom[4], uniting us and strengthening our collective identity as Europeans.
But while central banks have long offered digital settlement in central bank money for wholesale transactions, we do not yet have a digital form of cash.
This is becoming increasingly problematic because the use and acceptance of cash are declining. In the euro area, cash transactions have fallen below card transactions in value.[5]And the share of companies reporting that they do not accept cash has tripled in the last three years to 12%.[6]The European Commission has therefore put forward a legislative proposal to ensure the acceptance of cash[7]and the ECB is committed to keeping euro cash widely available and accessible.[8]Still, the trend towards less use of banknotes for daily transactions is likely to continue, reflecting the digitalisation of economic activity and mirroring patterns observed in many advanced economies.
Moreover, digital payments in the euro area remain fragmented, both along national lines and in terms of use cases. Current European digital payment solutions mainly cater to national markets and specific use cases. To pay across European countries, consumers have to rely on a few non-European providers, which now dominate most of these transactions. And even those providers’ payment solutions are not accepted everywhere and do not cover all key use cases (payments in shops, from person to person and online).
So a key objective of central bank money – to offer the public a means of payment backed by the sovereign authority that can be used for retail transactions across the jurisdiction – is not being fulfilled in the euro area’s digital space. This is all the more awkward given that some euro area countries have made it mandatory to accept digital means of payment, for instance in a bid to combat tax evasion.
In addition, European payments have become a prime example of the situation that Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi have described in their recent reports.[9]The fragmentation of the market, the lack of European payment solutions available on a European scale and the difficulty faced by European payment service providers in keeping pace with technological advances[10]means that Europe is not competitive within its own market, let alone on a global scale.
Moreover, in an unstable geopolitical environment, we are being left to rely on companies based in other countries. Today’s dependency on US companies could in future develop into reliance on companies from countries other than the United States. Platforms like Ant Group’s Alipay have demonstrated their ability to bridge geographical gaps: during major events like UEFA EURO 2024 they were able to boost their payment app usage among customers in Europe.[11]
We must move swiftly to address the risks stemming from Europe’s current inability to secure the integration and autonomy of its retail payment system. This is a key motivation behind the digital euro project: bringing central bank money into the digital age would provide a digital equivalent to banknotes and strengthen our monetary sovereignty.
Today, I will outline the policy challenges we face as digitalisation reinforces the two-sided nature of the payments market. I will then discuss how the introduction of a digital euro could make a significant difference. By designing the digital euro to meet the diverse needs of consumers, merchants and payment service providers, we can ensure its widespread adoption. This, in turn, will empower us to pursue strategic goals such as innovation, integration and independence, ultimately enhancing our economic efficiency, resilience and sovereignty.
The retail payments market: a two-sided marketplace
To fully appreciate why we have been failing to overcome fragmentation and why the digital euro would be a game changer, we must first understand the structure of the retail payments market as a two-sided marketplace.
Retail payment systems act as vital intermediaries connecting two key participants – merchants and consumers – whose transactions are facilitated by payment service providers.[12]The defining feature of this marketplace is that interactions between participants generate network effects, where the value for each group increases as more participants join the other side. Consider the telephone system: its utility grows with each new user. However, on the downside, this also creates a challenging chicken-and-egg dilemma. Platforms need a critical mass of users to attract additional participants, but they struggle to achieve scale without that initial user base.
That is why platforms with existing large user bases have an advantage in entering such markets. Indeed, the strength of network effects is amplified when platforms expand their range of activities, thereby broadening their user base.
Technological innovation and the rise of digital platforms managed by major tech companies are expected to further exacerbate these dynamics. Big techs conduct business in finance in a unique way, drawing on three mutually reinforcing components: data analytics, network effects and interconnected activities.[13]Network effects help big techs gather more data, which enhances their analytics. Better analytics improve services and attract more users, allowing them to offer more services and gather even more data.
As a result, payment apps provided by big techs have become especially popular in emerging markets and developing economies.[14]Take China, for example. Its financial system has largely disintermediated banks from payment transactions. Instead, big techs have leveraged the widespread use of mobile apps, integrating social interactions and shopping experiences to offer users seamless digital payment methods.[15]What is even more problematic is that these companies operate closed-loop payment systems, in contrast to international card schemes’ open-loop systems. In a closed-loop system, consumers load money onto their Alipay account, for example, and pay by scanning the merchant’s Alipay QR code. As a result, funds are transferred directly from the consumer to the merchant, bypassing the traditional system of banks and network processors. Only the owner of the closed-loop system has access to the payment data. This challenges the traditional banking model, which relies on customer data and relationships to function effectively, and also has an impact on how credit is extended to the economy.[16]There is a risk that the closed-loop systems developed by successful online platforms and big tech companies could, in future, create a parallel economy with their own currencies and distinct units of account.
At global level, big techs such as PayPal and Apple have developed highly successful ecosystems based on the closed-loop financial services model. By encouraging people to use their payment apps, these ecosystems effectively oblige them to use their payment rails. In parallel, payment platforms have tried to become more integrated in social media giants like WhatsApp and Meta[17]. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) are considering offering payment functions.[18]And Amazon is now venturing into the credit card and payment app business too. These examples illustrate how these firms can exploit customer networks to create cross-subsidised links between various services.[19]
However, while network effects can foster a virtuous cycle of economic growth, they also pose significant risks.
In particular, walled gardens or lack of interoperability between various solutions can result in market fragmentation. Technology can be used to exclude competitors – for example, by preferencing a platform’s own products or restricting competing services – and so can skew the competitive landscape in favour of a dominant player. And these dynamics could further raise the barriers to enter and grow in the two-sided payments market, stifling competition and making it even more difficult for European payment solutions to emerge on a pan-European scale.
There is thus a risk that the current dynamics, where big tech companies seek to exploit the power of their platforms to expand in payments, could exacerbate the challenges facing the European retail payments market in terms of integration and the ability of European solutions to compete and innovate at scale.
Addressing market failures through European policy actions
Since the creation of the monetary union, European policymakers have taken significant steps to foster the development of private European payment initiatives that span the euro area. The hope was that these initiatives could enhance competition within the European payments landscape, providing consumers and businesses with more choice and better services.
From the launch of the Single Euro Payments Area to the recent adoption of the Instant Payments Regulation, the European Commission[20]and ECB[21]have worked with the private sector to support integration, innovation and the creation of a pan-European retail payment solution.
Yet, despite these efforts, more than 30 years since the inception of the Single Market and 25 years since the launch of the single currency, most European retail payment solutions remain national in scope, addressing only limited use cases. Moreover, 13 out of 20 euro area countries rely entirely on non-European solutions in the absence of their own domestic payment scheme.
As a result, people who live, work, travel or shop online in other euro area countries find themselves effectively dependent on two international card schemes, which enjoy strong market power. This situation discourages small businesses from expanding across borders or even into their national online markets, ultimately hindering the deepening of the Single Market.[22]And paradoxically, the benefits from the efforts we make to lower the barriers to trade in European product markets may not fully reach consumers, as they are absorbed in the form of higher profits by the few international players that currently enable payments in stores and online across Europe.
Rather than joining forces and sharing resources to develop successful pan-European solutions, national communities have often preferred to preserve the legacy of investments made in the past.[23]This reluctance has allowed a few major global players not only to dominate cross-border European payment transactions, but also to steadily capture an even larger share of domestic transactions. The result is that international payment schemes operated by non-European operators today facilitate 64% of all electronically initiated transactions with cards issued in the euro area.[24]
Merchants – and consumers, to whom costs are eventually passed on – are left to deal with the consequences of the international card schemes’ market dominance.
For instance, the average net merchant service charges in the EU nearly doubled from 0.27% in 2018 to 0.44% in 2022.[25]This increase occurred despite regulatory efforts to contain it[26], as international card schemes exploited their strong negotiating position to raise the non-regulated components of the merchant service charge, such as scheme fees.[27]As a result, every year, European merchants collectively transfer large amounts to international card networks.[28]The cost falls disproportionately on smaller retailers, who face charges that are three to four times higher than those paid by their larger counterparts.[29]
This situation has raised concerns among European businesses of all sizes.[30]While the EU competition authorities can take effective action, they usually do so after dominance has been established. Moreover, they have to deal with the complexities of regulating payment networks.[31]
This trend highlights broader competitiveness issues that have emerged across various markets. In Canada, class action lawsuits alleging collusion to set higher interchange fees have been filed against certain banks as well as Visa and Mastercard.[32]In the United Kingdom, the Payment Systems Regulator has provisionally concluded that there is insufficient competition in the card payments market. This lack of competition allows the two largest schemes to raise fees.[33]Similarly, the United States Justice Department filed a civil antitrust lawsuit earlier this week against Visa, claiming that Visa’s exclusionary and anticompetitive conduct undermines choice and innovation in payments and imposes enormous costs on consumers, merchants and the American economy.[34]It emphasised that Visa extracts fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market and amount to a hidden toll adding up to billions of dollars imposed annually on American consumers and businesses. And because merchants and banks pass on those costs to consumers, Visa’s conduct affects not just the price of one thing, but the price of nearly everything.[35]
The fact that these issues are not unique to Europe offers little comfort, particularly when considering that, unlike in the United States, this situation poses a risk to our monetary sovereignty.
The excessive dependence on foreign entities in the European payments sector threatens the autonomy and resilience of European payment services. Without decisive public action, this dependence is likely to worsen. New foreign players – including from China[36], Brazil[37]and India[38]– are seeking to enter, or increase their footprint in, the European market.
While foreign competition is welcome, we cannot be satisfied that Europeans do not have their own digital payments solution allowing them to pay throughout the euro area. And we need to be careful that foreign central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) do not end up eroding the international role of the euro, especially as some jurisdictions are thinking about allowing their CBDCs to be used abroad.[39]
European policymakers – and particularly the ECB – have recognised this challenge. In response, we have initiated the digital euro project, which is currently in the preparation phase.[40]
Digital euro: addressing fragmentation and delivering tangible benefits
The digital euro project is a crucial step towards enhancing Europe’s payments landscape and safeguarding our monetary sovereignty.
By ensuring everyone across the euro area would have access to central bank money in digital form, the project aims to provide tangible benefits to consumers, merchants and payment service providers alike.
Complementing banknotes, the digital euro would offer all European citizens and firms the freedom to make and receive digital payments seamlessly.
During my recent hearing before the European Parliament[41], I extensively discussed the benefits of the digital euro for consumers, particularly in terms of the convenience it would offer.The digital euro would provide a single, easy, secure and universally accepted public solution for digital payments in stores, online and from person to person. It would be available both online and offline. And it would be free for basic use.
At the hearing, I also highlighted how the digital euro would provide merchants with seamless access to Europe's consumer base. Moreover, it would offer an alternative that would increase competition, thereby lowering transaction costs in a more direct way than regulations and competition authorities can.[42]
The digital euro would also generate broader benefits for the euro area economy by fostering competition and innovation.
European payment service providers are finding it increasingly difficult to compete with international card schemes and e-payment solutions. For example, Apple Pay has significantly expanded its reach in Europe, capturing a portion of interchange fees, which represents a “significant expense”[43]for issuing banks. As a result, banks risk missing out on not only interchange fees but also client relationships and user data.
By contrast, the digital euro would ensure that distribution would remain with payment service providers, allowing them to maintain customer relationships and be compensated for their services, as is currently the case.[44]It would also offer an alternative to co-branding with international card schemes for cross-border payments in – and potentially beyond – the euro area, thus promoting competition.
The digital euro would also expand opportunities for payment service providers while reducing the cost of rolling out solutions on a European scale. In addition, it would cultivate an environment conducive to the widespread adoption of payment innovations throughout Europe.
Currently, several innovations aimed at simplifying payments are emerging within specific national markets or across a few countries, driven by European payment service providers. Although these innovations are highly commendable and would enhance people’s lives, existing structural barriers mean they would encounter considerable obstacles in trying to achieve pan-European scale. This fragmentation along national lines further impedes private participants’ ability to achieve the scale required in a two-sided market like the payments market.
What is the end result? By failing to implement large-scale innovations accessible to everyone in the euro area, these companies are unable to achieve the optimal scale needed for continuous investment in new technology. This limits their ability to compete effectively with the large international players who can fully leverage economies of scale, even on a global level.
According to the European Commission’s legislative proposal[45], the digital euro’s legal tender status – which would require merchants to accept the digital euro for electronic payments – and mandatory distribution would help overcome the challenges of achieving sufficient scale in a two-sided marketplace by ensuring widespread accessibility and acceptance across the euro area. This legal tender status, combined with the digital euro rulebook, would establish common standards, which are not in place today.
Let me use an example to explain this in simpler terms. At the moment, in-store payment terminals often use technology known as the “kernel”[46], provided by Mastercard and Visa, to enable contactless (near field communication) transactions. Although domestic card schemes can currently access this technology for free, multi-country European card schemes cannot. Moreover, this free-of-charge policy could change at any time.
In the future, all stores would be required to accept the digital euro, meaning payment terminals would need to support its standard. According to the draft regulation, the standard would have to be made available for reuse by private parties, who could use it to develop their services. This would mean that all payment terminals in Europe that support digital euro transactions would be equipped with a scheme-agnostic kernel. This open system would be accessible to both regional and domestic European payment schemes, thereby allowing customers to make contactless payments throughout the euro area.
This would advance a more integrated European payments market. As private providers expand their geographical footprint and diversify their product portfolios, they will benefit from cost efficiencies and be better positioned to compete internationally.
In essence, the network effects generated by a digital euro would function as a public good, benefiting both public and private initiatives. This approach is akin to creating a unified European railway network or European energy grid, where various companies could competitively operate their own services and deliver added value to customers.
Instead of requiring significant investment to expand existing services across the euro area, the open digital euro standards would facilitate cost-effective standardisation, making it possible for private retail payment solution providers to launch new products and functionalities on a broader scale.
Ultimately, whether through the digital euro or private solutions, this standardised framework would unlock innovation, create new business opportunities and improve consumer access to a diverse range of goods and services.
The design of the digital euro, as well as the key provision in the Regulation proposed by the European Commission, contains all the key elements required to make this vision a reality.
Over the past years, we have extensively engaged with a multitude of market stakeholders, including through the Rulebook Development Group[47]and the Euro Retail Payments Board, to shape the digital euro value proposition and prepare its implementation. We have collected and discussed the input of the payments ecosystem at large, including from representatives of consumers, merchants, banks and other payment service providers.
In the coming months we will expand our cooperation with the private sector, focusing on three main themes: how to create a more competitive environment to encourage innovation and offer consumers more choice, how to best identify and leverage synergies to enhance efficiency and create mutually beneficial opportunities across the payments ecosystem, and how to strengthen the business models of all stakeholders, ensuring they can adapt and thrive in a rapidly evolving landscape.
Each of these value drivers will be discussed in depth, taking into account the different roles in the payment chain, including those of issuing banks and third-party providers. By adopting this inclusive approach, we can ensure that everyone’s needs and perspectives are addressed, paving the way for a more robust and dynamic payments system.
Conclusion
Let me conclude. Money is key to sovereignty, a reality that resonates more than ever in the digital age.
Some 63 countries are now operating, piloting, developing or exploring retail CBDCs.[48]Meanwhile, major private payment solutions are expanding globally and some nations may even seek to leverage crypto-assets, with figures such as US presidential candidate Donald Trump promising to make the United States a “Bitcoin superpower”.[49]
In this fast-moving environment, Europe cannot stand still. And the role of the ECB in issuing money that is accepted throughout the euro area is particularly crucial in a monetary union where payments markets remain fragmented along national lines.
We are committed to ensuring that people in Europe can continue to use cash.[50]However, we cannot stand by and watch as individuals are unable to use central bank money for their daily digital transactions.
Bringing central bank money into a digitalised world through the digital euro would safeguard our monetary sovereignty in the digital age. It would overcome fragmentation by offering money that can be used for any digital payments in the euro area, foster competition and innovation by facilitating the development of pan-European payments services and strengthen our autonomy and resilience by helping us avoid becoming over-reliant on foreign payment solutions.
Thank you for your attention."

Welcome address by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board, at the eighth annual conference of the ESRB
Frankfurt am Main, 26 September 2024
I would like to welcome all of you to the eighth annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).
The theme this year – “New Frontiers in Macroprudential Policy” – challenges us to rethink the ways in which we ensure financial stability in an evolving world.
Traditionally, macroprudential policy has focused on safeguarding the stability of banks, particularly by addressing boom-bust cycles in real estate. Banks continue to hold significant exposures to the real estate sector, and this remains a core area of our oversight.
But today our world is undergoing swift and profound changes.
While we must remain alert as ever to cyclical risks, major structural transformations – from shifting geopolitics to a changing climate and extraordinary advances in technology – are creating new frontiers in macroprudential policy. These have important implications for financial stability that are not yet fully reflected in our current frameworks.
Today I would like to focus on what one of those frontiers – technology – means for the financial system and, by extension, the response of macroprudential policy.
As the Nobel laureate Christian Lange once observed, technology can be a “useful servant”, but it can also be a “dangerous master” if left unchecked.[1]That observation holds true for the financial system, where technological advances pose both sizeable opportunities and risks.
In this setting, macroprudential policy needs to pull off a unique balancing act. To effectively mitigate the risks posed by new technologies, macroprudential policy must paradoxically embrace and harness the very innovations they create.
Technology as the enabler of modern financial systems
The basic needs that financial systems meet have not changed for centuries: saving for future needs, borrowing against future income, directing capital to productive uses and reallocating risk.
But the way financial systems deliver their services has changed radically – driven largely by advances in information and communications technologies.
In recent decades, powerful computing has revolutionised risk management and boosted market efficiency, enabling the pricing of complex financial instruments and the rise of algorithmic trading. One study, for example, finds that by facilitating faster price discovery, algorithmic trading improves liquidity for large-cap stocks.[2]
Another key enabler of modern finance is encryption technology. Without it, there would be no online banking and no electronic payments. But encryption has not only aided the digitalisation of traditional finance. It has also facilitated the rise of a new asset class and a parallel financial system: crypto-assets and decentralised finance.
The problems with crypto-assets are many, well-documented and not well-addressed – from weak fundamentals to questionable governance and inefficient validation methods.[3]But the encryption technology on which crypto-assets are based has so far proven robust. And distributed ledger technology can offer real benefits to our financial systems through the streamlining of processes.
But it is perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) that may prove to be the most transformative for the financial system.
For years now, analytical AI models designed to perform specific tasks have helped financial institutions in areas such as fraud detection, credit assessment and predicting portfolio returns.
But the recent breakthroughs in generative AI – thanks to growth in computing power combined with extensive data access – are inducing a rapid uptake of AI across the board. According to one international study, almost two-thirds of companies – across all regions, sectors and sizes – are already using generative AI.[4]
While new technologies have brought tremendous benefits for the financial system over time, they have always tended to carry potential risks with them.
And we see this tension between opportunity and risk playing out today. The latest AI models, and budding technologies like quantum computing, have the potential to exert a profound impact on our economies and financial systems.
Technological change and vulnerabilities
As a tool, technology is neither good nor bad. It all depends on who uses it, and for what purpose.
The financial sector will come up with numerous ways to use AI to improve existing operations. But the reliance on ever more sophisticated technologies – which typically demand highly specialised skills and enormous levels of investment to implement and maintain – creates new vulnerabilities in our financial system.
We see this especially in areas where our financial institutions are increasingly reliant on a small number of external service providers.
In July, a faulty software update from a leading cybersecurity firm caused worldwide computer outages and severe disruptions across many sectors, including finance. For instance, over eight million devices operating Microsoft Windows were hit simultaneously around the world.[5]
While the disruption did not last long, the episode demonstrated the potential dangers of a broad-based reliance on a small number of third-party providers. These technology firms may have systemic importance and are a key element of the Digital Operational Resilience Act, an EU microprudential legislation.[6]
This concentration risk is further heightened in an environment marked by geopolitical tensions and the rapid uptake of AI.
Hostile states could wreak havoc if they uncover just one critical weakness in our financial system. At the ESRB, we expected intensified cyberattacks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[7]Fortunately, the financial system has proven resilient so far, but the risk remains.
The widespread adoption of AI may also have systemic implications for the financial system. For example, if AI suppliers were to remain concentrated, operational risk, market concentration and too-big-to-fail externalities may arise. Moreover, an extensive uptake of AI could increase the potential for herding behaviour.[8]
Looking further ahead, advances in quantum computing may pose a serious threat to our encryption-based financial system. The technology may even go on to eventually break current encryption methods, although it is difficult to know when this might happen.
That is why it is critical to start preparing early – and there are already efforts to do so.
In August, for example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States finalised the first post-quantum encryption standards and called for their rapid deployment.[9]Efforts by individual financial institutions will not be enough, however: the shift to post-quantum encryption standards will need to be implemented across the economy to ensure sufficient resilience.
The implications of technology for macroprudential policy
As macroprudential policymakers, our primary role is to ensure that the financial system remains stable and resilient in the face of emerging threats.
Historically, macroprudential policy has focused heavily on cyclical risks. But as we look into the future, we need to pay more attention to major structural changes. Technologies such as AI and quantum computing will reshape the financial landscape in ways we are only beginning to grasp.
Macroprudential policy must evolve to meet these new frontiers. The risks stemming from disruptive technologies will not be confined to individual institutions – they will be systemic. But the tools we have relied on in the past may no longer be sufficient. Larger buffers are not always the right answer, nor are they the only answer.
Our task now is to focus on how technological risks affect the interconnections and vulnerabilities across the entire financial system and ask ourselves how we may need to expand our toolkit.
The answer is for macroprudential authorities to harness the power of new technologies, using the new opportunities they create as a force for good to mitigate the risks that technology may pose to the financial system.
There is substantial potential on this front. AI can give us the capability to analyse vast amounts of supervisory and market data. And it can help us conduct more rigorous risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities faster and ensure timely prudential responses to new threats.
We will need to consider a broader range of potentially disruptive scenarios and improve our capacity to model the financial stress that such scenarios can generate. The available data allow us to go a long way. But we need to go even further and remove obstacles to safe data sharing.
In my capacity as Chair of the ESRB, I have recently called on European lawmakers to facilitate the removal of barriers to safe data sharing between the ESRB and European Supervisory Authorities, a crucial step towards enabling us to use data to their full potential.[10]At the same time, we need to enhance our collaboration across institutions, sharing insights and expertise so that we can collectively tackle the challenges ahead.
By embracing technology, the role of macroprudential policy will be to help microprudential supervision to stay ahead of the curve, ensuring financial institutions are not only compliant with today’s rules but are also resilient to tomorrow’s threats.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
As with tackling cyclical risks, macroprudential policy at the new frontier centres on being proactive rather than reactive.
Policymakers cannot afford to simply respond to crises as they emerge. We must continually attempt to anticipate them, harnessing the power of technology and data to build a financial system that is truly resilient. As Benjamin Franklin once wrote, “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”.[11]And Franklin knew this first-hand. He is widely credited for developing and popularising the use of the lightning rod, which would go on to prevent many disasters.
Looking at this conference’s agenda, I am confident that the discussions will spark fresh perspectives and innovative ideas as we explore the new frontiers of macroprudential policy.
Thank you."

Introductory statement by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 23 September 2024
It is a pleasure to be here today to meet the new members of this Committee and to update you on the status of the digital euro project. Let me also congratulate Madame Lalucq on her election as ECON Chair.
The ECB appreciates the open and valuable exchanges we have had with the ECON Committee on the digital euro since the beginning of the project. I am fully committed to continuing these exchanges and look forward to our future discussions.
Today I will focus on three key areas. First, Europe’s dependency on foreign players for retail payments. Second, the benefits of a digital euro for everyone, including consumers, merchants and banks. And third, the progress we have made on the digital euro project so far.
Foreign dominance in the European payment landscape
Fast-forward to the year 2030. Imagine you are at the football World Cup in Spain. You want to buy a drink, but you can only pay with Alipay. This scenario is not as far-fetched as it may seem: this summer, buying tickets for the European Football Championships in Germany was only possible with Chinese or American means of payment.
Could you imagine this happening in the United States? Going to the finals of the American football league, for example, and having no American means of payment available? I certainly cannot.
The Eurosystem will of course continue to ensure that people in Europe can pay with cash.[1]However, cash is becoming less and less popular as digital payments and online shopping grow.[2]
For example, more and more people are buying their groceries online. But you can’t use cash to pay for these. More often than not, the only option is PayPal or an international card scheme like Visa or Mastercard.
And more and more people are using digital wallets like PayPal or Apple Pay on their mobile phones. By 2027 these platforms are expected to handle 40% of e-commerce and 27% of in-store payments in Europe.[3]
At the same time, the share of companies in the euro area not accepting cash has been increasing significantly.[4]
These developments are contributing to the marginalisation of elderly and less tech-savvy people. They also make us dependent on non-European companies, which is risky.
Imagine what would happen if you could not pay digitally. For example, two weeks ago significant parts of the European card payments market were shut down for almost an entire day.[5]Just like with electricity, gas or water, we don’t think about payments until they stop working. For energy, we had to learn this the hard way following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For payments, we owe it to Europeans to do better.
We need our own strong digital payments system.[6]We can achieve this by bringing central bank money into the digital era with the introduction of a digital euro: a digital form of cash, issued by the central bank and available to everyone in the euro area.[7]
A digital euro would strengthen Europe’s financial sovereignty and resilience because it would be built with European technology and infrastructure. It would empower Europe to independently develop and manage digital payment solutions, supporting the further deepening of the Single Market.[8]
But most importantly, the digital euro would offer tangible benefits to all stakeholders – consumers, merchants and banks.
Benefits for European citizens
We strongly support the Single Currency Package[9], whichwill ensure that cash remains widely accessible and accepted. At the same time, it will pave the way for a digital euro, which would take the advantages of cash into the digital world.
Consumers could use a digital euro for all payments, everywhere in the euro area, also when shopping online. With a digital euro, making or receiving payments would be free of charge and as easy as using cash today. Consumers would need to use only one device and remember just one password. In addition, having a single means of payment for all circumstances would make it easier for users to have an overview of their expenditure.
Importantly, a digital euro would seek to promote digital financial inclusion by ensuring that no one is left behind.[10]It would be accessible to everyone across the euro area, via a mobile app or a physical card, so everyone can choose the technology that they are most comfortable with, no matter how old or tech-savvy they are.
Finally, a digital euro would offer the best possible privacy and data protection afforded by the current technology used in large payment systems.[11]From the outset, ensuring user privacy has been a central focus of the digital euro project.
A digital euro would be available both online and offline.[12]With the offline functionality, users would enjoy cash-like privacy. The details of your offline payments would only be known to you and the recipient. For online payments, too, we would ensure that your personal data remain your own. The Eurosystem will not be able to identify you, nor directly link you to your payments.[13]
New opportunities for merchants
A digital euro would also bring new opportunities for European merchants.
Right now, merchants in Europe are largely dependent on a handful of dominant online or card payment methods, often relying on non-European providers. International card schemes currently account for 64% of card transactions in the euro area.[14]
This costs European merchants a lot of money. They collectively pay a significant amount each year to international card schemes like Visa or Mastercard. And the cost is mostly borne by smaller merchants, who incur charges three to four times higher than those of their larger competitors.[15]
A digital euro would include safeguards for merchants by capping the fees they pay to banks for processing payments.[16]A digital euro would thus narrow the gap between what smaller and larger merchants are charged for digital payments.
By providing a true alternative to existing payment solutions, a digital euro would also put all merchants, large and small, in a stronger position to negotiate better conditions with other providers. Finally, it could provide a safety net for merchants in case of network or power outages, thanks to its offline functionality.[17]
Benefits for banks
Banks would benefit too, particularly in our rapidly evolving payment landscape, in which new players – especially big tech companies from outside Europe – are increasingly entering the market. The banks would be remunerated for the services they offer, while the Eurosystem would cover the costs of the digital euro scheme and infrastructure.
When you compare a digital euro with services like PayPal or Apple Pay, the benefits for banks become even clearer. For instance, banks do not earn anything if people top up their PayPal wallet via direct debit. And with Apple Pay, banks actually have to pay a fee just to let their cards be used in Apple Wallet.
A digital euro would also open up a new source of revenue by allowing banks to provide value-added services to their customers.[18]
We are working closely with the market to ensure that a digital euro leverages the existing standards as much as possible, which would keep costs down and support Europe’s competitive payment landscape.[19]
Moreover, cards and applications currently available in only one or a handful of Member States could use these standards to reach customers across the euro area without the need to invest in new acceptance infrastructure. Therefore, a digital euro would mean that European payment service providers could offer their customers the convenience of using their product everywhere in the euro area – just like international card companies. It would also strengthen banks’ negotiating positions vis-à-vis these companies.
Finally, banks and other payment service providers would be responsible for distributing a digital euro, thus serving as the sole point of contact for digital euro users. So a digital euro could help banks retain their customers in the face of growing payments competition.
Project preparation phase at full speed
Let me now give you a brief update on where we stand with the project.[20]
We started the investigation phase back in 2021 and are now at the midpoint of the preparation phase, with roughly one more year to go.
One of our key focus areas during this phase is to develop a methodology for determining the maximum amount of digital euro a person could hold at any time.[21]The holding limits are important to ensure financial stability and prevent large-scale transfers from bank deposits to digital euro, especially during crises.
These limits would be high enough to avoid negatively affecting the digital euro user experience.[22]
Experts from the ECB, the national central banks in the Eurosystem and national competent authorities, building on their unique know-how, have started to identify the factors that could influence the holding limit calibration, on the basis of three key areas defined in the draft Regulation: usability, monetary policy and financial stability.[23]
While the exact holding limits would be defined closer to the potential launch and on the basis of a well-defined governance process enshrined in the draft Regulation,[24]we are committed to ensuring that our methodology would be predictable. This is why ECB experts regularly talk to consumers, merchants and financial institutions, to keep everyone updated on the technical work and to gather feedback.
We are also working on finalising the digital euro rulebook, which will provide a clear set of rules and standards to ensure a consistent user experience across the euro area.[25]This will also help private companies roll out their own solutions.[26]We are working closely with all the representatives in the Rulebook Development Group, including consumers, retailers, banks and non-bank associations.
In addition, we are currently in the process of selecting potential providers[27]who could develop a digital euro platform and infrastructure.[28]
Finally, we are also looking closely at other key technical aspects, such as privacy and offline functionality. We will keep you updated on all these developments.
By the end of 2025the ECB’s Governing Council will decide whether to move to the next phase of the project. But the Governing Council will not take any decision about the issuance of a digital euro before the legislative act has been adopted.
Conclusion
To conclude, introducing a digital euro across the euro area would take time, but it is key for Europe’s future. Countries across the world are exploring retail central bank digital currencies. If we want to be standard-setters and keep our position among the frontrunners, we need to move swiftly.
A digital euro is a common European project, which is why we are talking to all the relevant stakeholders and carefully listening to their views and concerns. I also remain committed to engaging regularly with the European Parliament.
Introducing a digital euro that all banks and other providers make available to their customers and that all merchants accept, everywhere in the euro area, would take several years. Market participants need certainty to invest in the digital euro and this requires coordination between co-legislators and the central bank.
I appreciate all the work that the ECON Committee has done on the digital euro so far. The legislative discussions are now in your hands. The ECB is of course ready to engage with the negotiating team and to provide continued technical support when needed.
It is important that the legislative and technical work advance in parallel, swiftly and in close cooperation. Together, we can ensure that the digital euro strengthens Europe’s financial sovereignty and serves all its citizens."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the 2024 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture organised by the IMF
Washington, DC, 20 September 2024
Central banks are public institutions with powerful tools, but the way these tools affect the economy is constantly changing. This uncertainty comes, in part, from the famous “long and variable” lags of monetary policy transmission.[1]It typically takes 18 to 24 months for a change in interest rates to have its peak effect on the economy and inflation.[2]
But there are also more fundamental issues that affect the transmission of monetary policy, which were identified by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 20 years ago. He wrote that:
“The economic world in which we function is best described by a structure whose parameters are continuously changing. The channels of monetary policy, consequently, are changing in tandem.”[3]
In other words, the effectiveness of monetary policy is intrinsically linked to the evolving structure of the economy. In recent years, uncertainty about policy transmission has been particularly acute.
We have faced the worst pandemic since the 1920s, the worst conflict in Europe since the 1940s, and the worst energy shock since the 1970s. These shocks have changed the structure of the economy and posed a challenge for how we assess the impact of monetary policy. This challenge was exacerbated by the fact that the pandemic caught us after a long period of anaemic growth, below-target inflation and low interest rates.
To manage this uncertainty, we introduced a three-pronged policy framework, focusing not only on forecast inflation but also on underlying inflation dynamics and the strength of transmission. This framework has been instrumental in helping us calibrate the rate path over the last phase of the hiking cycle, during the period when we held rates at their peak and, more recently, as we have started to make policy less restrictive.
Our determined policy actions have successfully kept inflation expectations anchored, and inflation is projected to return to 2% over the second half of next year. Considering the size of the inflation shock, this unwinding is remarkable.
But the uncertainty ahead is still profound. The economy is currently undergoing transformational changes and we need to analyse and understand their impact.
While some of these changes – like climate change and ageing societies – are unique to our times, others resemble those that took place a century ago. Two specific parallels between the “two twenties” – the 1920s and the 2020s – stand out. Today, like back then, we are seeing setbacks in global trade integration, at the same time as strides forward in technological progress.
But there is an important difference in how these changes are affecting monetary policy.
In the interwar period, structural shifts affected the prevailing monetary policy strategy. The main lesson for central banks was that the dominant paradigm was not robust in times of profound structural change.
It was this realisation that led to modern monetary policy strategies emerging a few decades later, with a core focus on price stability and flexible policy strategies to deliver it.
Thanks to these developments, we are in a better position today to address these structural changes than our predecessors were. The challenge we face is not about our goals, which have proven successful, or our tools, which are sufficiently flexible.
Rather, it is about how monetary transmission will be affected by structural shifts, and how we should adjust our analytical frameworks to these shifts.
In my remarks today, I will start by exploring the parallels between the structural changes of the 1920s and those of the 2020s, while highlighting the different implications for monetary policy in each era. I will then share some preliminary considerations for the evolution of policy frameworks.
My main message is that we must be ready for change and prepared to use the flexibility in our frameworks as necessary. To ensure stability in the future, our approach must continue to embody “stability without rigidity”, allowing us to adjust swiftly as the economy transforms.
Post-war structural shifts and monetary policy in the 1920s
If we go back a century to the 1920s, the world economy was going through a series of transformations. These shifts pulled in different directions, representing both setbacks and strides forward from the previous environment. They fundamentally changed the structure of the economy.
Two of these shifts had profound implications for monetary policy.
The first was global fragmentation, which put an end to the open, liberal economic order of the late 19th century and its assumed permanence.
The decades leading up to the First World War had seen rapid global integration. World trade as a share of GDP rose from 10% in 1870 to 17% in 1900 and then to 21% by 1913, creating new expectations and lifestyles. As John Maynard Keynes famously wrote:
“the inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep […] he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent.”[4]
At the same time, the dominant paradigm among major central banks was the gold standard, which prioritised maintaining an external equilibrium and relying on intrinsic mechanisms for domestic credit to adjust to external imbalances.
But the war brought about the end of Pax Britannica, while the United States was reluctant to assume the role of global hegemon sustaining open trade. Economic nationalism rose and a rapid unravelling of globalisation followed. World trade as a percentage of GDP fell to 14% in 1929 and 9% in 1938.[5][6]Tariffs more than tripled in most European countries[7]and also rose in the United States.[8]
Major central banks initially attempted to revive the gold standard in the mid-1920s to recreate the conditions for open trade, but they faced a worsening trade-off.
As Ragnar Nurkse showed in his seminal study, in a more unstable world, central banks increasingly had to use gold reserves as a buffer against external shocks rather than allowing them to be transmitted to domestic credit growth.[9]While this approach was intended as a “second-best” policy to maintain a degree of domestic stability, it ultimately exacerbated deflationary pressures. Deflation in turn fuelled economic malaise and contributed to the cycle of economic nationalism.
The second major shift in this period was rapid technological progress. While fragmentation was a step back, technology unambiguously took a step forward. But it triggered a series of changes in the economy and financial markets that created new challenges for central banks.
Innovation accelerated rapidly in this period, fuelled largely by spillovers from wartime advancements. This surge saw new machinery introduced on a much larger scale than before. Progress was most visible with the internal combustion engine, the assembly line pioneered by Henry Ford, and the electrical network and motor.[10]
The technological boom drove rapid productivity gains. In Britain, for example, 55 employee weeks were required to produce a car at the Austin Motor Company in 1922, compared with only ten in 1927.[11]For Europe as a whole, the average rate of productivity growth[12]rose to over 2% per year between 1913 and 1929, up from about 1.5% per year between 1890 and 1913.[13]
Irrational exuberance about technology, however, also fuelled a significant rise in stock market valuations. Research indicates that a 1% increase in a firm's stock of cited patents corresponded to a 0.26% increase in market value during the 1920s.[14]But central banks lacked a framework for dealing with booms and busts.
Several central banks tried unsuccessfully to pop stock bubbles[15], and then they took a series of wrong turns when the crash came. The resulting banking crisis and the return to a deflationary stance – which in the United States, for example, appeared justified by the prevailing real bills doctrine – are now widely considered to have played a significant role in exacerbating the Great Depression.[16]
A key lesson ultimately became clear for governments: central banks needed a new concept of stability. And this concept had to be reflected in their monetary policy strategies.
As the economic historian Michael D. Bordo observed, in the 1920s central banks tried to focus on both external and internal stability, “but as long as the gold standard prevailed, external goals dominated.”[17]
The main realisation of the interwar period was that central banks in advanced economies needed to be assigned domestic stability targets first and foremost. But it took another 30 to 40 years to realise that they would do better stabilising inflation rather than fine-tuning output and employment.
Structural shifts and monetary policy in the 2020s
Today, we also face some setbacks as the global economy fractures, while seeing strides forward with transformative digital technologies expanding.
The consequences for monetary policy, however, are different.
The last few years have been an extreme stress test of inflation targeting across the globe. We have faced not only back-to-back shocks, but also a differing variety and strength of shocks in different places. For example, Europe suffered much more than the United States from high energy prices, while the United States had to contend with the legacies of a stronger stimulus to demand.
Yet, inflation is converging towards target almost everywhere. And remarkably, disinflation has come – at least so far – at a low cost to employment. As I recently observed, it is rare to avoid a major deterioration in employment when central banks raise rates in response to high energy prices.[18]But employment has risen by 2.8 million people in the euro area since the end of 2022.
There are two reasons for this greater stability.
First, decades of inflation targeting have had a deep impact on how people build expectations about future inflation. Indeed, when the inflation goal is stated sufficiently clearly, and monetary policy is credible, inflation expectations will remain anchored, which makes the adjustment process to an inflationary shock less painful.
Second, over time central banks have recognised that stability should not mean rigidity.
Indeed, we are better placed to confront structural changes because policy strategies combine three elements: clearly defined inflationtargets, flexiblepolicy toolkitsto deliver those targets, andanalyticalframeworksthat can assess and respond to changes in the economy, thereby feeding into our reaction functions. We have used all these elements in recent years to ensure that monetary policy maintains price stability without excessive costs to the economy.
For these reasons, the ongoing transformations will not revolutionise the goals of monetary policy as they did a century ago. But theyarelikely to have a more profound impact on monetary transmission.
Just as one era of globalisation reached a turning point in the aftermath of the First World War, we are now witnessing another wave of globalisation plateauing. The hallmark of this era was the geographical unbundling of production through global value chains (GVCs), which led to a doubling in the value of traded intermediate goods. It now accounts for over half of world trade.[19]
But the landscape is changing. We are not seeing outright “de-globalisation” in the sense of a reversal in world trade. But we are seeing the structure of GVCs changing in response to a more volatile environment, marked by more frequent supply shocks[20]and a fragmenting geopolitical landscape.[21]
ECB analysis finds that both the United States and the euro area have recently diversified their supply of imported goods, leading to a larger number of sourcing countries and increasing costs.[22]In the United States, firms appear to be exploring the options of both “nearshoring” production in Canada and Mexico and “reshoring” at home.[23]In Europe, the focus is on “nearshoring” production within the region while still exporting globally.[24]
These changes have implications for monetary transmission, as they could partially reverse some of the long-term changes in the economy that may weaken transmission.
First, they could strengthen the link between domestic slack and inflation.
A key puzzle that central banks faced in the 2010s was that policy easing was transmitted strongly to activity but in a weaker fashion to inflation. One explanation for this disconnect was that the expansion of GVCs reduced the impact of domestic slack on inflation by shifting the focus to global factors.[25]However, if GVCs become shorter or less efficient, domestic slack and inflation may reconnect. This shift could make monetary policy impulses more powerful.
Second, policy transmission may strengthen as GVC restructuring could potentially boost capital deepening. Inducements for “strategic sectors” to set up closer to home may lead to a resurgence of capital-intensive industries within advanced economies. In the United States, for instance, manufacturing construction spending has doubled since the end of 2021 in response to policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act.[26]
Such a shift could somewhat attenuate the long-term shift in activity towards services and the observed slowdown in capital deepening over recent decades. In turn, capital deepening could increase the economy's sensitivity to interest-rate changes, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of monetary transmission through the interest-rate channel.
By strengthening the transmission mechanism, these shifts could potentially allow central banks to exercise more control over domestic outcomes. But these benefits would be offset if the restructuring of GVCs led to more volatile inflation.
In a stable global environment, the expansion of GVCs facilitated a virtuous cycle of trade integration and stable inflation, as GVCs buffered the effects of cost-push shocks. Research shows that a 1% increase in input prices resulted in only a 0.44% increase in output prices owing to this buffering effect.[27]But if supply chains were to shorten, it could lead to stronger pass-through of cost shocks.
Like in the 1920s, setbacks in some areas are being matched by advancements in others. We find ourselves in the midst of a digital revolution that echoes the technological boom of the 1920s.
Just as that era saw rapid advancements in electricity, automobiles and mass production, our era is witnessing unprecedented growth in digital technologies. In particular, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) looks set to transform a swathe of industries, including the financial sector. And financial technology (fintech) is already having a profound impact on finance.
In 2022, fintech generated 5% of global banking revenue, totalling USD 150 billion to USD 205 billion. This share is expected to exceed USD 400 billion by 2028, growing at an annual rate of 15%. Banks are also acquiring fintech firms and adopting their technologies to enhance their lending operations.[28]
By changing the nature of financial intermediation and fostering competition, fintech can significantly strengthen the transmission of monetary policy decisions to the wider economy, influencing interest rates, asset prices, credit conditions and ultimately growth and inflation.
For example, advanced credit scoring[29]and new sources of credit provided by fintech platforms can reduce lending constraints. By leveraging alternative data sources, which can include over 1,000 data points per loan applicant, fintech using AI and machine learning has outperformed traditional credit scoring models in predicting loss rates, particularly for riskier firms.
These developments are already expanding access to finance. Fintechs have been found to process mortgage applications around 20% faster than other lenders.[30]The use of data could also alleviate the need for collateral, thereby extending credit to underserved businesses at a lower cost.
The modern consumer who can quickly check their creditworthiness and secure the best financial deals through their smartphone is no distant fiction. In some ways, it mirrors how the Londoner of the past could effortlessly order global goods from their bed.
As a result, fintechs’ credit supply tends to be more responsive to changes in borrowers' business conditions or broader economic conditions[31], contrasting with traditional banks’ emphasis on long-term relationships with borrowers. This responsiveness also means that fintech lending could be more procyclical in times of stress, amplifying credit cycles and volatility.[32]
But the net benefits for transmission hinge crucially on the effect of digitalisation on market structures.
Digital markets tend to be “winner-takes-most”, as is visible in the handful of “hyperscalers” that dominate digital platforms and cloud services. For example, just three US “hyperscalers” account for over 65% of the global cloud market. Google commands an outstanding market share of more than 90% among search engines. In e-commerce, business is concentrated among a handful of top players.
Market power has important effects on policy transmission. IMF research finds that firms with greater market power are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the United States, a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate causes a low-markup firm to cut sales by about 2% after four quarters. By contrast, a high-markup firm barely reduces its sales in response to the same policy change.[33]
This reduced sensitivity is likely due to the larger profits and cash reserves of superstar firms, which make them less dependent on the external financing conditions affected by monetary policy. More generally, research finds that the superior efficiency and size of superstar firms significantly reduces the labour share of income,[34]which may also weaken policy transmission.[35]
In short, digitalisation could make the financial sector more able to adjust financing conditions to economic conditions, but it could also make parts of the corporate sector more insensitive to monetary policy.
Some tentative implications for monetary policy
We are too early on in these transformations to come to any clear conclusions for monetary policy transmission. But we can identify some of the key questions that central banks will face.
In this context, it is important to stress that the core goals of monetary policy will have to remain unchanged. Rather than forcing us into painful trade-offs, as happened a century ago, our monetary policy strategies have proved effective, mitigating trade-offs between inflation and employment.
If we enter an era where inflation is more volatile and monetary policy transmission more uncertain, maintaining this deep anchor for price formation will be essential.
But aswe start to understand the effects of global fragmentation and digitalisation on monetary transmission, we will have to continuously reassess our analytical frameworks. Just as in previous eras, stability should not mean rigidity.
Regular strategy reviews provide an opportunity for self-reflection. We published the results of our last strategy review in 2021, which mainly took stock of the low inflation era, and we expect to conclude the 2025 assessment of our strategy in the second half of next year.
Important elements of the previous review remain valid. In particular, we will maintain the symmetric, medium-term oriented 2% inflation target. But there are two key areas in which we need to develop our framework to be more robust in times of profound change.
First, we need to reduce as much as possible the uncertainty created by these structural shifts. We can do so by deepening our knowledge and analysis of the ongoing transformations, and how they may affect the shocks we face and the transmission of our policy.
Second, as uncertainty will nonetheless remain high, we need to manage it better.
In particular, we should reflect on how our policy framework incorporates risk assessments. While our current three-pronged policy framework provides a useful set of cross checks, the strategy review provides an opportunity to consider how to balance the information from baseline forecasts with real-time information, how to make best use of alternative scenarios, and the importance of the medium-term orientation when faced with different types of shocks.
The two main strands of our 2025 review will correspond to these goals.
First, we will look at how the economy has changed in the post-pandemic world, aiming to distinguish as best we can cyclical from structural drivers. As part of this analysis, we will consider how we can improve our analytical framework, including embedding new techniques and sources of data into our forecasts.
Increasing the use of AI will be an important element. Machine learning will help us, for example, to identify non-linearities in macro forecasting, to use large data sets for event prediction, and to improve inflation nowcasting. These advances may be especially important in relation to near-term forecasting, which is not the strength of traditional macro models.
Second, we will consider what we can learn from our past experience with too-low and too-high inflation, including for our reaction function. We will look at how our medium-term orientation can be made operational when faced with both upside and downside risks to inflation expectations.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
History shows that structural shifts matter for monetary policy, even if their effects take time to appear. They affect how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy. And, in the past, they sometimes affected the fundamental goals that monetary policy pursued.
Today, the goals of monetary policy do not change, because a focus on price stability has been shown to be crucial in times of profound change. But that does not imply that the way in which we conduct monetary policy will remain the same.
In 1933, the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, told his newly appointed economic advisor that “you are not here to tell us what to do, but to explain to us why we have done it.”[36]
So, let me end by promising you this: we will not take that approach. We will draw on our best analysis, experience and knowledge, so that when change comes, we will be ready."

Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the European Investment Bank Chief Economists’ Meeting
Luxembourg, 16 September 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to cover two topics.  First, I will briefly explain our decision last week tolower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – by 25 basis points. Second, I will outline some considerations that will be covered by the 2025 assessment of our monetary policy strategy.
The monetary policy decision
Based on our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, our confidence in a timely return of inflation to target is supported by declining uncertainty around our projections, including their stability across projection rounds, and by inflation expectations across a range of indicators that remain aligned with a timely convergence to target.[1]
The incoming data on wages and profits have been in line with expectations. The baseline scenario of the latest ECB staff projections foresees a demand-led economic recovery that boosts labour productivity, allowing firms to absorb the expected growth in labour costs without denting their profitability too much. This should buffer the cost pressures stemming from higher wages, dampening price increases. Most measures of underlying inflation, including those with a high predictive content for future inflation, were stable at levels consistent with a return of inflation to target in a sufficiently timely manner. While domestic inflation is still kept elevated by pay rises, the projected slowdown in wage growth next year is expected to make a major contribution to the final phase of disinflation towards our target. Financing conditions for firms and households remain restrictive, as our past policy rate increases continue to work their way through the transmission chain. Credit growth remains sluggish amid weak demand.
Based on this assessment, it is now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary policy restriction. The decision to lower the deposit facility rate (DFR) by 25 basis points is robust across a wide range of scenarios. At a still clearly-restrictive level of 3.5 per cent for the DFR, the realisation of upside shocks to inflation that would call into question the timely return of inflation to target could be addressed by a slower pace of rate reductions in the coming quarters compared with the baseline rate path that is embedded in the projections. At the same time, compared to holding at 3.75 per cent, a DFR level of 3.5 per cent offers greater protection against downside risks that could delay the recovery and lead to a material undershooting of our target further out in our horizon, including the risks associated with an excessively-slow unwinding of the rate tightening cycle.
In the near term, headline inflation is expected to fluctuate over the next few months. In particular, headline inflation is expected to be low in September before rising again in the latter part of this year, partly because previous sharp declines in energy prices will drop out of the annual rates. Negotiated wage growth will remain high and volatile over the remainder of the year, given the significant role of one-off payments in some countries and the staggered nature of wage adjustments. The forward-looking wage trackers also signal that wage growth will be strong in the near term.
Further out in the projection horizon, staff continue to expect a rapid decline in inflation, from 2.6 per cent in the final quarter of this year to 2.0 per cent in the final quarter of 2025. The expected drop in core inflation (primarily services inflation) is even sharper, from 2.9 per cent in the final quarter of this year to 2.1 per cent in the final quarter of 2025. Indeed, the weaker economy and lower wage pressures that characterise the new projections mean the expected speed of disinflation in the course of 2025 has been upwardly revised. The expected significant deceleration in wage growth next year is in line with the information contained in the wage trackers and reflects the fading out of the “catch-up” dynamics that have driven wage growth in the last couple of years. The disinflation process in 2025 will also be supported by well-anchored forward-looking inflation expectations and weaker price-price and price-wage backward-looking dynamics, in view of the much lower inflation in 2024 compared to 2023.
Looking ahead, a gradual approach to dialling back restrictiveness will be appropriate if the incoming data are in line with the baseline projection. At the same time, we should retain optionality about the speed of adjustment. In one direction, if the incoming data indicate a sustained acceleration in the speed of disinflation or a material shortfall in the speed of economic recovery (with its associated implications for medium-term inflation), a faster pace of rate adjustment may be warranted; in the other direction, if the incoming data indicate slower-than-expected disinflation or a faster pace of economic recovery, then a slower pace of rate adjustment may be warranted. These considerations reinforce the value of a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach that maintains two-way optionality and flexibility for future rate decisions.
The 2025 assessment of monetary policy strategy
An important element of the 2021 monetary policy strategy review was the commitment to assess periodically the appropriateness of the monetary policy strategy and it was flagged that the next assessment would take place in 2025. As indicated by President Lagarde at the July press conference, the preparatory work by the Eurosystem staff for this assessment has now started and the Governing Council expects to conclude this assessment in the second half of 2025.
The 2021 strategy review followed an eighteen year gap since the 2003 strategy review and was naturally a very thorough exercise. The 2021 review has served us well and important elements do not require any re-assessment. In particular, we will maintain the symmetric, medium-term oriented two per cent inflation target, which has been essential in re-anchoring inflation expectations coming out of the low-inflation period and in keeping inflation expectations well anchored at target during the inflation surge period.
Our 2025 assessment will consist of two broad strands: economic developments since the pandemic; and the implications for monetary policy.
We will assess the cyclical and structural factors shaping the inflation and economic environment in the light of the recent inflation experience, analyse the likely evolution of those factors over the years ahead and examine the implications for the inflation challenges that may confront the ECB. As part of this analysis, we will also look at the possible enhancements of the existing analytical toolkit, including forecasting techniques.
We also assess the implications of the changed inflation environment for the monetary policy strategy. This will include reviewing the lessons learned from the low and high inflation periods and our experiences with the evolving roles of the instruments in the policy toolkit over the monetary policy cycle. We will furthermore examine the operationalisation of the medium-term orientation of the monetary policy strategy, with a focus on the ECB’s reaction function to both upside and downside threats to the anchoring of inflation expectations to the target. This will includes the analysis of how risk and uncertainty should inform both policy decisions and policy communication."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the ESCB Legal Conference 2024
Frankfurt am Main, 6 September 2024
As a lawyer, I am always glad to discuss the novel legal issues affecting the work of central banks and supervisors.
At last year’s conference I spoke to you about climate-related litigation and its impact on the financial sector.[1]This year I want to talk about the risks that nature degradation poses to the economy and the financial sector.
As I have said before, assessing nature-related risk is not some kind of tree-hugging exercise. We are talking about material financial risks, which – like any other type of risk – must be assessed, analysed and managed.[2]
Today, I want to focus on the legal implications of nature-related risk for our central banking and supervisory work. I will first outline the growing trend of nature-related litigation. Then I will look at how nature-related risk should be considered in the context of the mandates of central banks and supervisors.
Nature degradation: risks for the economy and the financial sector
Scientists worldwide agree that nature has been declining at an unprecedented rate over the past 50 years. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) already sounded the alarm back in 2019, shortly before the outbreak of the global pandemic. The IPBES report even warned us that nature degradation was exacerbating emerging infectious diseases in wildlife, domestic animals, plants and people.[3]
The decline of nature is primarily caused by human activity and is being made worse by climate change. Scientists have calculated that humanity is using natural resources 1.7 times faster than ecosystems can regenerate them – in other words, we are consuming resources equivalent to 1.7 planet Earths.[4]
This decline undermines the planet’s ability to provide ecosystem services, which are the benefits we obtain from nature to support and sustain our society and economies. Examples of ecosystem services include food, drinking water, timber and minerals; protection against natural hazards, such as floods and landslides; or carbon uptake and storage by vegetation.[5]
The degradation of nature not only threatens these ecosystem services, but also increases the risk of us reaching ecosystem tipping points, i.e. non-linear, self-amplifying and irreversible changes in ecosystem states that can occur rapidly and on a large scale.[6]Through these tipping points, we are at risk of going beyond the Earth’s safe operating space for sustaining life on the planet.[7]
From the perspective of central banks and supervisors, the degradation of nature makes our economies, our companies and our financial institutions increasingly vulnerable.
We cannot ignore these vulnerabilities. Indeed, we need to deepen our understanding of how nature-related financial risk affects the economy and the financial system.[8]
Work is progressing at the ECB: for example, our research has found that 72% of euro area companies are highly dependent on ecosystem services and would experience critical economic problems as a result of ecosystem degradation.[9]Moreover, research by the European Commission  has detailed that several sectors of the European economy – in particular agriculture, real estate and construction, and healthcare – are heavily dependent on nature and thus exposed to associated risks.[10]
Work is also progressing at international level. The Financial Stability Board recently took stock of supervisory and regulatory initiatives among its members and established that a growing number of financial authorities are considering the potential implications of nature-related risks for the financial sector.[11]In addition, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – a network of 138 central banks and supervisors from around the world – had already acknowledged the relevance of nature-related risks for the mandates of central banks and supervisors back in March 2022.[12]The NGFS has since developed a conceptual framework offering central banks and supervisors a common understanding of nature-related financial risks and a principle-based risk assessment approach.[13]
All these efforts are improving our ability to quantify the financial implications of nature degradation. And of course, there are also important legal implications that we need to start talking about.
Nature-related litigation
The first legal implication is the rise in nature-related litigation.[14]Litigants are starting to understand the link between climate change and nature degradation and are using the legal system to drive policy change.
Building on their successes in the field of climate litigation,[15]litigants are taking court cases to address the biodiversity crisis, protect carbon sinks, limit deforestation and loss of ocean habitats, and prevent ecosystem degradation.[16]
In July of this year the NGFS published a report on this new trend to raise awareness among financial institutions, central banks and supervisors.[17]The report highlighted that while nature-related litigation is still in its infancy, the number of cases is expected to grow rapidly.
The report reiterated that litigation can affect financial institutions, not only where they are directly challenged, but also indirectly, when their counterparties, or the states in which they operate, are subject to such claims.[18]
The report identified two key categories of nature-related litigation as well as two key drivers.
In terms of categories of litigation, most nature-related cases are being brought against states and public entities, using arguments based on fundamental rights.[19]This is not surprising given how effective such arguments have been in climate litigation.
Interestingly, however, corporates and banks, too, are already being directly targeted in nature-related litigation. This contrasts to the trends we saw under climate litigation, where cases against the private sector were much slower to start.
First, this may be because climate litigation has offered a blueprint for action for litigants who are seeking innovative ways to protect nature. Second, it may be because nature-related litigation can identify a closer causal connection between the impact of economic activities on local ecosystems and people. It is often easier to pinpoint the damage and attribute responsibility to specific actors. Thanks to new legislation, it is also becoming easier to hold multinational companies liable for harm occurring in remote parts of their global supply chains.And we can even see that litigants are already challenging banks that are alleged to finance such companies.[20]
Indeed, we can observe a close nexus between corporate litigation and legislation. Litigants are already relying on new corporate sustainability due diligence legislation,[21]on tort law, anti-money laundering laws[22]and shareholder rights to bring nature-related claims. The number of such cases is likely to grow as further legislation – such as the EU Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence and the EU Deforestation Regulation – enters into force.
Looking now at the drivers behind the trend in nature-related litigation, the first is that scientists – and litigants – are developing a much better understanding of the climate-nature nexus. Protecting nature is crucial to mitigating climate change and vice versa. The climate crisis deepens the nature crisis, thus diminishing nature’s ability to mitigate what the UN Secretary General has called “the era of global boiling”.[23]The scientific consensus on this point may help litigants to strengthen their cases.[24]
The second driver is that courts are taking, as a given, the findings of climate and environmental science, in the same manner as any other area of technical expertise. Court assessments and rulings are taking into account advanced scientific concepts and sources. We saw this quite clearly in the recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, in the case brought by a group of Swiss grandmothers.[25]There, the Court based its ruling on the IPCC reports, and took it as a matter of fact that climate change exists, that it poses a serious threat to human rights, and that states are aware and capable of doing something about it. Moreover, the Court held that states have a positive obligation to act, regardless of whether their individual contribution might be a “drop in the ocean” in terms of its ability to affect climate change.[26]
Relevance of nature degradation for the mandates of central banks and supervisors
This leads me to the next key legal implication of the nature crisis: how will it affect the mandates of central banks and supervisors?
It goes without saying that addressing the nature crisis is primarily up to governments and legislators. However, as I mentioned at the outset, central banks and supervisors also need to consider the nature crisis as a source of risk to the economy, financial system and the individual banks they supervise.
A very clear example of this is the way banking supervision is looking at nature-related risks. Back in 2020, the ECB’s guide on supervisory expectations for the risk management of climate-related and environmental[27](C&E) risks already highlighted the need for banks to identify, measure and – most importantly – manage nature-related risks, such as water stress and pollution.[28]
We have been actively following up with banks regarding these supervisory expectations since then.[29]The first interim deadline fell due in March 2023, when banks were expected to have in place a sound and comprehensive materiality assessment of both climate and nature risks. Since then, we have issued binding supervisory decisions against 28 banks that failed to meet this first interim deadline – with the possibility of imposing periodic penalty payments in the 22 most relevant cases, if the banks don’t remedy this shortcoming in time.
Banks were also expected to meet a second interim deadline in December 2023, and by the end of this year, we expect all banks under our supervision to be fully aligned with all our supervisory expectations on the sound management of C&E risks.
In that respect, nature degradation is already integrated in ECB supervisory work as a risk driver that banks are expected to manage. Rather than considering nature-related risk as a standalone category of risk, we see it as a driver for each traditional type of risk reflected in the Capital Requirements Directive, from credit risk, reputational and operational risk including legal risk, to market and liquidity risk.
We must also properly consider nature-related risk in the context of our monetary policy mandate.
First, the nature crisis could have direct implications for price stability – the primary objective of the ECB. One of the papers presented at the annual ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal, in July shows how loss of biodiversity can cause losses to economic output while at the same time decreasing the resilience of output to future biodiversity losses.[30]
As part of its Climate and Nature Plan 2024-2025, the ECB is conducting further work on the risk posed to the economy by nature loss and degradation.[31]This will inform our understanding of risks to price stability and financial stability.
Second, it is clear from the Treaties that the ECB must take into account the EU’s policies to address nature degradation when carrying out its mandate.[32]There are two key legal bases for this: the ECB’s secondary objective in Article 127(1), second sentence, and the transversal Treaty provisions of Articles 11 and 7 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The ECB’s secondary objective states that, without prejudice to price stability, the ECB shall support the general economic policies in the EU, with a view to contributing to the objectives of the EU. These objectives include “the sustainable development of Europe” and “a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment”. It is irrefutable that the EU’s climate policy constitutes part of the general economic policies in the EU. As reiterated in the European Climate Law, the transition to net zero affects every aspect of economic life, in all sectors. Thus, to the extent that nature protection directly contributes to climate crisis mitigation and adaptation – which it often does – the ECB must support the EU’s efforts in this field. In this context it is notable that the EU adopted the groundbreaking Nature Restoration Law earlier this year[33]and signed up to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (the “Paris Agreement for nature”) in 2022[34]– significant developments that could be invoked to argue that nature protection, just like climate policy, constitutes an independent general economic policy. As lawyers, we need to watch this space.
Beyond the secondary objective, the ECB has to comply with two key transversal principles of the Treaties. Article 11 of the TFEU provides that the EU’s environmental protection requirements must be “integrated into the definition and implementation of the Union's policies and activities”.[35]This imposes an obligation on the ECB to take into account the EU’s policies to protect nature when shaping its own policies and performing its tasks. In addition, under Article 7 of the TFEU, the activities and policies of the ECB need to be consistent with EU law – including EU law on nature and biodiversity.
This does not mean economists should start counting ants in Aragon, butterflies in Bavaria or worms in Wallonia. Instead, economists must develop means to transpose insights from nature science into variables of economic interest like growth, inflation and financial risks.
In developing tools for policy analysis of nature-related risks, the growing availability of data from sustainability disclosures will make it easier for central banks to identify how they need to incorporate nature into their work. Recently adopted legislation, in particular the sustainable finance framework[36], creates an entire “ecosystem” of EU legislation that makes the link between nature degradation, the economy and the financial sector – and thus central banks and supervisors – clear and apparent. It leaves us in no doubt that we have the duty and the tools at our disposal to take nature-related risk into account when we exercise our mandate.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The economy and the financial sector are vulnerable to nature-related risks. This vulnerability is all the more relevant given the importance of nature in mitigating and adapting to climate change.
Time is running out to prepare for the materialisation of nature-related risks. We need to be ready for the impact of these risks, just like we are for climate-related risks – or indeed for any other risk driver.
For that reason, we need to properly consider the legal implications of nature-related risks for the financial sector, and for the mandates of central banks and supervisors.
Thank you for your attention."

Lecture by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Ragnar Nurkse Lecture Series organised by Eesti Pank in Tallinn, Estonia
Tallinn, 30 August 2024
Disinflation in the euro area has proceeded rapidly. Headline inflation fell from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.6% in July of this year. Data released yesterday suggest that in August inflation has declined further in parts of the euro area.
These are welcome developments. They largely reflect an unwinding of the forces that over the past three years have led to strong increases in the prices of energy, food and goods, as well as the impact of our restrictive monetary policy.
However, the current level of headline inflation understates the challenges monetary policy is still facing. In particular, domestic inflation remains high at 4.4%, largely reflecting persistent price pressures in the services sector, where disinflation has effectively stalled since last November.
While goods inflation has fallen back to its pre-pandemic average at a fast pace, services inflation is still more than twice as high as its average between 1999 and 2019 (Slide 2, left-hand chart).
As a result, services have accounted, on average, for 70% of headline inflation since the start of the year (Slide 2, right-hand chart). Within the services sector, price pressures are broad-based, with strong wage growth being just one factor keeping inflation at elevated levels (Slide 3, left-hand chart).
Stubbornly high price pressures in the services sector are a global phenomenon. Across many advanced economies, services inflation remains high, even if there has been, on average, more progress towards pre-pandemic levels than in the euro area (Slide 3, right-hand chart).
Continued high inflation momentum, defined as the annualised three-month-on-three-month change, suggests that services prices keep rising at an elevated pace of almost 5% (Slide 4, left-hand side).
Medium-term price stability does not require services inflation to slow to 2%. Persistent relative price changes, often reflecting sectoral differences in productivity growth, are not unusual. In many advanced economies, the prices of services relative to those of goods have increased for a long time (Slide 4, right-hand side).
But for price stability to be restored sustainably, services inflation needs to return to a level that is consistent with underlying inflation of 2% over the medium term.
Uncertainty calls for policy robustness
To assess whether the current monetary and financial conditions will secure a timely return of inflation to target, policymakers need to take a stand on the likely future evolution of the economy.
Incoming data offer useful clues in this regard. But since monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags, there is a risk that policy might be adjusted too slowly if too much weight is given to backward-looking data.
Therefore, economic projections remain a key input to our decision-making process.
In the euro area, the latest Eurosystem staff projections are consistent with a return to price stability. They predict that inflation will fall to 2.2% in 2025 and to 1.9% in 2026, even if the last mile of disinflation is expected to be bumpy, with inflation likely to fall in the coming months before rising again towards the end of the year.
Under strict inflation forecast targeting, policy should be adjusted to validate the financial conditions on which this outlook relies.
However, inflation forecast targeting was already a challenge even in more tranquil times when shocks to inflation and its drivers were less pervasive.[1]
Since 2001, inflation projections from the forecasting community, including the ECB, have on average had little explanatory power for realised inflation over horizons beyond the very short term (Slide 5).[2]In most cases, these forecasts almost mechanically converge to the 2% target, unless judgement is applied.
Managing inflation is particularly challenging in an era of transformation.[3]
We are seeing fundamental changes in labour and energy markets and a reorganisation of global supply chains. At the same time, due to structural headwinds in some euro area economies, it is increasingly difficult to identify the impact of monetary policy on growth and inflation.
These forces make it inherently more complex to produce accurate projections even over shorter horizons. While short-term forecast errors for inflation have generally come down since the start of the year, this masks differences within the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) basket.
In particular, recent improved forecast accuracy for core inflation reflects offsetting forecast errors for goods and services. Since January, disinflation in services has consistently been slower than anticipated.
In this environment, policy should be robust to contingencies causing the economy to evolve differently from what is implied by the modal outlook. Monetary policy that would be optimal under strict inflation forecast targeting can be suboptimal when knowledge is imperfect.[4]
Monetary policy to remain focused on bringing inflation down
Scenario analysis is a powerful tool for making policy more robust while retaining a forward-looking perspective. Plausible alternative scenarios that scrutinise the key assumptions underlying the modal outlook highlight the large uncertainty surrounding the baseline scenario.
If this uncertainty is communicated clearly and transparently, the distribution of future expected policy outcomes may better reflect the risks to the modal outlook.
Inevitably, policy cannot be robust to all contingencies. A policy that is robust to downside risks is unlikely to be equally resilient against upside risks, and vice versa. Central banks thus need to weigh the risks and focus on those considered to be the most detrimental to the achievement of their mandate.
In the current environment, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation back to our target in a timely manner, for three main reasons.
First, while risks to growth have increased, a soft landing still looks more likely than a recession.
In recent weeks, financial markets have repriced more fundamentally the expected pace of central bank easing, also in the euro area. This reflects concerns that global growth is at risk of a rapid deterioration.
While growth prospects warrant close scrutiny in the coming weeks, the market repricing reflects, by and large, spillovers from abroad that were amplified by technical factors, including reduced liquidity during the summer period and the unwinding of yen carry trades.
It is therefore unclear to what extent the repricing reflects a change in macroeconomic fundamentals, also given the relative stability of growth forecasts for major economies by market analysts (Slide 6). At the ECB, too, growth projections for the euro area for 2024 and 2025 have remained broadly stable since September 2023.
While monetary policy has to avoid unnecessary pain, it must also avoid overreacting to volatile financial market expectations. Central banks’ actions should be guided by their evolving assessment of the inflation and growth outlook.
Second, history shows that central banks were often unsuccessful in bringing inflation back to target after a long period of very high inflation.[5]
In their new research, Christina and David Romer show that perseverance is critical for successfully restoring price stability after a large inflation shock.[6]They demonstrate that strong perceived commitment to disinflation has often not been sufficient to reduce inflation through its impact on expected inflation.
Rather, successful disinflation was typically the result of policymakers having persisted in their efforts to fully extinguish past inflationary shocks.[7]Hence, central banks must not abandon disinflationary policies too early.
In the euro area, as we gained confidence in the projected disinflation path, we decided to start dialling back the degree of policy restraint earlier than central banks in other advanced economies. But the earlier monetary policy shifts in response to forward-looking signals, the more cautious and gradual it can afford to be on the way back to (an unknown) neutral.
Third, even if inflation is no longer a primary concern to financial markets, it is still very much on people’s minds.
Although headline inflation has come down quickly, inflation perceptions are proving more persistent, and untypically so from a historical perspective. Today, more than 40% of people still regard inflation as having risen “a lot” over the past 12 months (Slide 7, left-hand side).
Elevated inflation perceptions raise inflation persistence and make inflation expectations more susceptible to new shocks, as memory cues make people recall past inflation experiences more rapidly.[8]
In a new study, economists at the Federal Reserve Board quantify these risks.[9]They show that inflation persistence has increased measurably across advanced economies, including the euro area.
As a result, if today the euro area were to be hit by a “normal” supply shock, as opposed to the unusually large shocks of the past few years, inflation would be higher by almost one percentage point next year compared with a scenario where inflation persistence is lower.
This risk is also reflected in the right tail of the inflation expectations distribution remaining thicker than before the pandemic, even among professional forecasters (Slide 7, right-hand side).
Incoming data broadly confirm the baseline scenario
Making policy robust to these risks requires a thorough review of the main assumptions underlying the baseline scenario for policy to be adjusted. Such a broad-based review is carried out every three months when the projections are updated.
In the euro area, the expected decline in headline inflation to the 2% target by the end of 2025 rests on three critical assumptions.
One is that the current high growth in unit labour costs predominantly reflects the lagged effects of past price shocks related to the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
As many wage contracts are only infrequently negotiated, the economy can take some time to return to equilibrium. The recent sharp decline in headline inflation should therefore progressively lead to lower wage growth, as also suggested by staff analysis (Slide 8, left-hand side).
Unit labour cost growth is expected to slow further once the adverse impact of labour hoarding on productivity growth reverses as demand recovers.
The second assumption is that firms are absorbing a large part of the current strong increases in unit labour costs in their profit margins, as the current level of interest rates is dampening the growth in aggregate demand.
The third assumption is that price pressures outside the services sector will ease further or evolve in line with historical regularities.
Over recent weeks, incoming data have lent support to these assumptions.
Negotiated wage growth slowed visibly in the second quarter. Although part of this development is driven by volatile one-off payments, with wage growth expected to reaccelerate in the third quarter, surveys and private sector forecasts suggest that expected wage increases will moderate measurably in 2025 and beyond (Slide 8, right-hand side).
Firms also expect that increases in their selling prices will decline as growth in input costs slows.
According to the most recent Survey on Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), selling prices are expected to increase by 3% on average over the next 12 months, down from 4.5% at the end of last year (Slide 9, left-hand chart). While firms in the services sector still expect a larger increase in their selling prices compared with other sectors, the size of intended price increases is declining there too.
Firms have also started to use their margins to absorb the increases in labour costs. In the first quarter of this year, unit profits no longer contributed to inflation in a meaningful way (Slide 9, right-hand chart). This is a significant change from last year.
Monetary policy is actively supporting this rebalancing process. By constraining growth in aggregate demand, it makes it more difficult for firms to pass on higher costs to consumers. Surveys suggest that the current level of interest rates is incentivising people to save more and spend less.
Notably, savings intentions for the coming year have never been higher than they are today, with households actively shifting their savings into time deposits offering higher returns (Slide 10). As consumer confidence is recovering and households’ unemployment expectations remain subdued, it is likely that the desire to save is not driven by precautionary motives only.
Finally, energy and food inflation have recently surprised to the downside, while a stronger euro, coupled with the recent fall in oil prices, can ease headline inflation further, at least over the near term.
All in all, recent data remain consistent with the baseline scenario that foresees that inflation will sustainably fall back to our 2% target by the end of 2025. Along with signs of a potential decline in economic momentum in other parts of the world, there is less risk that a further moderate and gradual dialling back of policy restraint could derail the path back to price stability.
An alternative scenario: scrutinising the key assumptions
It is conceivable, however, that the conditions on which the modal outlook rests do not materialise. Scenario analysis can reveal the reasoning behind these risks and evaluate their consequences for the inflation outlook.
In the alternative scenario, growth in unit labour costs would not come down as quickly as projected. In the June Eurosystem staff projections, annual growth in unit labour costs is expected to fall to 2.5% in 2025, from 4.7% this year.
This is a sharp decline, especially as unit labour costs were still growing at an annual rate of 5.3% in the first quarter, with momentum remaining high. By way of comparison, annual unit labour cost growth in the United States was only 0.9% in the second quarter.
Growth in unit labour costs could disappoint expectations because of stronger wage growth. Although surveys suggest weaker wage growth ahead, the staggered nature of wage negotiations implies that workers may take longer than projected to recoup their purchasing power.
While in some countries, such as Portugal and Spain, workers have, on average, recouped the losses incurred in their real wages since before the pandemic, there is still a considerable share of workers in Italy, Germany, Finland and other countries whose real wages remain well below pre-pandemic levels (Slide 11). This also reflects differences in the duration of collective wage agreements.
Wages could also expand more strongly if labour market conditions remain tight. A protracted imbalance between labour supply and demand could more fundamentally challenge the assumption underlying the Eurosystem staff projections that wage growth merely reflects past price shocks and the resulting catch-up process.
While labour demand is slowing, it remains high in an environment in which unemployment is historically low and where a significant share of firms, especially in the services sector, still regards labour as a factor limiting business (Slide 12). If a shortage of labour prevents firms from increasing production, rising demand results in higher inflation rather than higher output.
Another reason why unit labour cost growth could remain higher than projected is a weaker recovery in productivity growth. In the Eurosystem projections, annual productivity growth is forecast to recover to 1% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026, nearly double the historical average.
The pick-up in productivity growth may be weaker if part of the current weakness is not cyclical but more persistent, reflecting the structural challenges facing the euro area economy.[10]In fact, over the past year, the recovery in productivity growth has repeatedly been slower than expected.
Increasing trade tensions, environmental policies or higher energy prices could all weigh on productivity growth over the coming years, reinforcing upward pressure on the growth of unit labour costs and thus inflation.
In addition, under the alternative scenario, firms may decide to pass on a higher-than-expected share of rising labour costs to consumers.
The Eurosystem staff projections expect unit profits to stagnate this year as firms use their margins to absorb strong growth in input costs. The buffer provided by profit margins is particularly important in the services sector, which is more labour-intensive and where inflation is still high.
New evidence for the euro area suggests, however, that the pass-through of higher wages into producer prices is typically very strong in the services sector.[11]After two and a half years, the estimated pass-through is 86%, twice as high as in the manufacturing sector (Slide 13).[12]
In other words, if the pass-through in earlier stages of the pricing chain remains as in the past, there needs to be a strong decline in profit margins for the baseline to materialise.
Softening demand for services as part of a rotation back to goods could be one such factor. So far, however, demand for services has remained relatively resilient, even if there are signs of a weakening (Slide 14).
Looking ahead, it will be critical to observe how the interplay of rising real wages, a resilient labour market and the fading impact of monetary policy tightening will contribute to aggregate demand.
In particular, the most recent bank lending survey suggests that the economy is starting to adapt to higher interest rates, as banks reported a first increase in loan demand by households in two years, while loan demand by firms is still contracting, but at a more moderate pace (Slide 15).
Finally, price pressures outside the services sector may reappear.
Goods inflation is a case in point. Under the baseline scenario, it is expected to remain close to current levels as the disinflationary effect of the easing in supply chain disruptions fades.
At the same time, protectionism and geopolitical uncertainty are rising. According to the Peace Research Institute Oslo, the number of state-based conflicts is the highest since 1946.[13]
Geopolitical uncertainty is a key risk for the stability of global supply chains and commodity prices. Recently, for example, container freight rates have increased measurably, in part reflecting disruptions in the Suez Canal (Slide 16). A further escalation in the Middle East could disrupt energy markets and supply chains more fundamentally.
Global trade measures are increasing in parallel, especially for critical raw materials – the production of which is often concentrated in just a few countries (Slide 17).
Together with the growing impact of climate change on food prices, these are important forces that could challenge the assumptions underlying the baseline scenario.
Conclusion
I would like to conclude with three implications for monetary policy.
First, incoming data have broadly confirmed the baseline outlook, bolstering our confidence that conditions remain in place for inflation to fall back to our 2% target by the end of 2025.
Second, confidence is not knowledge. History will not judge our intentions but our success in delivering on our mandate. Given that the path back to price stability hinges on a set of critical assumptions, policy should proceed gradually and cautiously.
In particular, the closer policy rates get to the upper band of estimates of the neutral rate of interest – that is, the less certain we are how restrictive our policy is –, the more cautious we should be to avoid that policy itself becomes a factor slowing down disinflation.
In other words, the pace of policy easing cannot be mechanical. It needs to rest on data and analysis.
Third, the world around us is changing rapidly. When the future is as uncertain as it is today, the modal outlook provides a false sense of comfort. Scenario analysis can protect us from falling victim to model uncertainty and overconfidence.
Being transparent about what could go wrong, and factoring this into the decision-making process, can help make policy more robust to contingencies that threaten the achievement of our primary mandate.
Thank you."

Contribution by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, to the panel on “Reassessing the effectiveness and transmission of monetary policy” at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium
Jackson Hole, 24 August 2024
Introduction
My aim in this contribution is to provide a euro area perspective on the effectiveness and transmission of monetary policy.[1]As expressed in the monetary policy statements of the ECB’s Governing Council, the aim of monetary policy tightening has been to deliver a timely return of inflation to the medium-term two per cent target by dampening demand and guarding against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Even if sectoral shocks had played an important role in triggering the initial 2021-2022 inflation surges, monetary policy tightening was necessary in order to contain domestic demand and to signal clearly to price and wage-setters that monetary policymakers would not tolerate inflation remaining above the target for an excessively-long period.[2]
In this contribution, I will report on the transmission of monetary policy, via financial markets and the banking system, to domestic demand and inflation expectations during this tightening episode. My interim conclusion is that monetary policy has been effective in underpinning the disinflation process, with the transmission of monetary tightening operating to restrict demand and stabilise inflation expectations.
The effectiveness and efficiency of monetary policy has required a data-dependent approach to the calibration of the monetary stance. To this end, I will also discuss the importance for the calibration of monetary policy of fully recognising the asymmetric sectoral nature of the pandemic and energy shocks that triggered the initial inflation surges and the impact of sectoral balance sheets on macroeconomic dynamics. These considerations have shaped the monetary policy reaction function of the ECB during this episode, which has been guided by the incoming evidence on: (a) the unfolding inflation outlook; (b) the evolution of underlying inflation; and (c) the strength of monetary transmission (which, inter alia, depends on sectoral balance sheets).
Monetary transmission
Chart 1 shows the evolution of the euro short-term rate (€STR) forward curve since December 2021. In terms of the adjustment in policy rates, there were several distinct phases. Early in 2022, the yield curve shifted up in anticipation of future rate hikes, with the markets anticipating that the ECB would respond forcefully to the building inflation shock. In the second half of 2022, there was an accelerated campaign of outsized hikes in order to move sharply away from an accommodative stance. In the first nine months of 2023, further hikes brought the policy rate to a level that was assessed to be sufficiently restrictive, if held for a sufficiently long duration, to underpin a timely disinflation process. The policy rate was then held at its peak of 4 per cent from September 2023 to June 2024.
A striking feature of Chart 1 is that the inflation shock triggered a repricing of not only the near-term policy rate path but also the long-term policy rate path. At the end of 2021, the policy rate was expected to remain negative even in 2027 according to market pricing (and expert surveys). The re-pricing occurred in early 2022 and has persisted, with the 2027 (and longer-horizon) policy rate expected to settle in the neighbourhood of two per cent, which is consistent with market views of a near-zero equilibrium real rate and the successful delivery of the inflation target in the medium term.
This has meant the inflation shock triggered a fundamental re-setting of the interest rate path, with no expectation of a return to the extraordinarily accommodative monetary stance that had been in place since 2014/2015. At the same time, Chart 2 shows the longer-term yields rose by much less than short-term yields. The negative slope of the yield curve reflects the market assessment that inflation would normalise relatively quickly, such that the cumulative increase in policy rates also had a significant cyclical component that would be unwound. At the same time, this inversion of the yield curve also masked a marked increase in the term premium, including due to the significant decline in the bond market footprint of the Eurosystem (Chart 3): since December 2021, quantitative tightening is estimated to have raised the term premium in the overnight index swap (OIS) curve by about 55 basis points.[3]
In the bank-based European financial system, the transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending conditions plays a central role.[4]As shown in Chart 4, banks have faced higher funding costs (due to the combination of a rapid increase in bank bond yields and an increase (even if slower) in bank deposit rates) and bank lending rates to firms and households for new loans increased significantly (the prevalence of fixed-rate mortgages has meant that the lending rates facing existing household customers have increased far more slowly).[5]Banks have also tightened their credit standards applied to the approval of loans, as shown in Chart 5.[6]Credit volumes moderated rapidly and nominal credit growth has been very low since 2022, as shown in Chart 6.[7]
The decline in credit observed so far in the current cycle has been stronger than historical regularities, based on linear models, would have suggested. The particularly large and rapid increase in policy rates may have amplified the tightening impulse. Moreover, the perceived and abrupt end of the “low for long” era reduced the incentives to search for yield, further contributing to a pullback in risk taking by banks and customers.[8]Large policy rate hikes (including a persistent component) increased the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the willingness to lend. The combination of the war impact and rapid rate hikes also signalled a less positive economic future, reducing the expected revenues and increasing the expected future funding costs of potential borrowers, leading them to reduce their demand for credit.
The dampening of demand
Through the tightening of market-based and bank-based financing conditions, the restrictive policy stance has fed through to economic activity. Chart 7 shows that, the recovery in output over the period 2022-2024 has been much weaker than expected. Despite the impact of the war-related energy shock, the post-pandemic reopening did allow GDP to grow during the first nine months of 2022 (when monetary policy was not yet restrictive). Subsequently, economic activity stagnated between late 2022 and late 2023, with only a limited recovery during the first half of 2024.[9]In terms of demand components, public consumption has been the main consistent driver of growth, while private consumption and external demand have remained subdued in recent quarters (Chart 8). Investment has also been weak: a decline in housing investment has been a persistent drag on growth; while business investment was also hit, the impact was mitigated during 2022-2023 by past order backlogs that somewhat supported the production of capital goods.[10]
The subdued economic performance is also clearly connected to the uncertainty shock and the energy price and terms of trade shocks triggered by the unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russia. For instance, Chart 9 shows that, despite the post-pandemic output recovery and strong increase in employment, real disposable income stagnated during 2022 as inflation rose far more quickly than wages. The decline in real incomes would have been more severe in the absence of the countervailing fiscal measures that were widely introduced during 2022 and that boosted transfers to households and suppressed the most intense impact of rising energy prices on households. Indicators of consumer confidence fell at the onset of the war and, despite some gradual improvement, still remain below the pre-war level. Together with the contribution of the restrictive monetary stance, this helps to explain the still-limited response of consumption to the improvement in real disposable income that has been in train since the middle of 2023, due to the recovery in wages, the decline in inflation and the improvement in the terms of trade.
Put differently, the adverse war-related 2022 shocks to household incomes, the terms of trade and confidence indicators for both households and firms served as countervailing influences on demand conditions and thereby reduced the extent of demand dampening that needed to be generated by monetary tightening.
While employment growth also decelerated, it remained above the rate of output growth. Unemployment has remained broadly stable at a historically-low level, with employment growth accommodated by an increase in the labour force through a mix of rising participation and a recovery in immigration. This robust labour market performance (which has also mitigated the impact of rising interest rates on consumption) reflects the composition of activity, with services (including public services) more robust than manufacturing. It also reflects labour hoarding, with the anticipation of future recovery motivating firms to retain workers. In turn, labour hoarding was supported in 2022-2023 by strong profitability levels, the decline in real wages and the rise in interest rates (such that the relative price of labour versus capital declined). The moderation in the labour market in 2024 is consistent with a weakening of these forces, with profitability declining, real wages rising and a turn in the interest rate cycle.
Monetary policy affects demand and prices through multiple channels: someare more direct (via intertemporal substitution) and others are more indirect (via growth and employment). This means that the full impact of changes in monetary policy on aggregate inflation occurs only with long and variable lags. As consumers rein in their spending in response to monetary policy tightening, they start by consuming fewer goods with a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution, such as durables and non-essential items. They also reduce spending on goods that are more interest-rate sensitive, such as durable goods purchased using credit, including housing. Analysis by ECB staff suggests that the peak price response of items most sensitive to monetary policy shocks, which tend to include durables and non-essential items, is around three times larger than for less sensitive items.[11]The price reaction to monetary policy shocks of these more sensitive consumer items has been stronger in the recent tightening cycle than in past episodes of monetary restraint, reflecting the effectiveness of the steep and decisive hiking policy in dampening demand.
In summary, monetary tightening has restricted domestic demand, especially since late 2022. A dampened-demand environment directly reduces the capacity of firms to raise prices and workers to obtain wage increases. It also contributes to the stabilisation of inflation expectations, to which we now turn.
The anchoring of inflation expectations
A primary task for monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large pandemic and sectoral shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend by fostering an upward de-anchoring of inflation expectations that could persist even after the unwinding of the sectoral shocks. In particular, the very sharp rise in actual and projected inflation in the course of 2022 put a premium on guarding against the de-anchoring of inflation expectations and motivated an accelerated approach to monetary tightening between July 2022 and March 2023, with the policy rate hiked by 350 basis points over six meetings.
In the post-crisis years before the pandemic, expectations had become de-anchored to the downside. The pre-pandemic distribution of long-term inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) was skewed to the left, as shown in Chart 10, and had a medianexpectation of 1.7 per cent. A similar pattern was evident in market-based indicators.[12]Between the middle of 2021 and early 2022, there was a remarkable shift in long-term inflation expectations, with survey respondents moving away from the long-held views that inflation would remain below two per cent indefinitely.[13]In essence, the majority of respondents assessed that the inflation shock opportunistically served to re-anchor long-term inflation expectations at the target by demonstrating that target risks were two-sided.[14]This is in line with the behaviour of market interest rates shown in Chart 1: the re-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations has removed the need for an open-ended accommodative underlying monetary stance.
Reinforced by the target-consistent monetary policy decisions during this period, the stabilisation of medium-term inflation expectations has provided an important anchor in the disinflation process.[15]The sheer magnitude of the inflation surge, the successive upward price shocks and the shifts in the short-term inflation outlook clearly could have generated upside de-anchoring risks. Instead, as shown in Chart 11, throughout this period the high-inflation phase has been expected to be relatively short-lived, supporting the timely return of inflation to the target. As shown in Charts 12 and 13, there has also been a decline in the medium-term inflation expectations reported by firms in the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) and by households in the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES).
In turn, the anticipation of the monetary policy response helped to reduce the scale and duration of the inflation response to the large shocks. This anticipation effect was plausibly stronger during this episode, since the large shocks in 2021 and especially 2022 triggered an increase in the frequency of price adjustment.[16]A monetary policy stance that is clearly committed to the timely return of inflation to the target is especially powerful under state-dependent pricing.[17]An increase in the frequency of price changes represents both an extra cost from high inflation (since there are economic costs – including management costs – from adjusting prices more frequently) but also an opportunity: if price setters understand that the central bank is committed to returning inflation to the target in a timely manner through an aggressive interest rate response to the large shock, the phase of intense inflation will be shorter and the sacrifice ratio in terms of lost output will be lower since price setters only have to focus on adjusting prices to the cost shock rather than also having to incorporate an excessively-prolonged aftershock phase of second round effects.
In summary, the risk of an upside de-anchoring of inflation expectations has been contained. This has certainly been facilitated by the nature of the initial inflation shocks, with the relative price shifts triggered by the pandemic and the war-related energy shock reversing fairly quickly and disinflation being further supported by the innate demand-dampening characteristics of the war and the terms of trade deterioration. The historical evidence and model-based counterfactual analyses clearly indicate that an insufficiently -vigorous monetary policy response could have resulted in a persistent increase in the inflation trend. At the same time, the calibration of the monetary policy response also needed to contain the risk of returning to the downside-deanchored equilibrium that had prevailed in the euro area before the pandemic.
Sectoral shocks and disinflation dynamics
During the disinflation process, the calibration of monetary policy needed to take into account the reversal in energy inflation, the easing of pipeline pressures and the relaxation of supply bottlenecks. The pandemic and the subsequent energy shock triggered by Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine had asymmetric and time-varying effects on different sectors. During 2020 and 2021, the impact of the pandemic on activity was most severe for contact-intensive services, while the goods sector was overwhelmed by the mismatch between a positive global demand shift and a decline in global supply capacity due to pandemic-related shutdowns and supply-chain interruptions. During 2022, the dislocations in the oil and gas sectors due to the Russia-Ukraine war were associated with an extraordinary surge in energy prices, which also constituted a severe terms of trade shock for the euro area as a net energy importer. In Europe, the full relaxation of pandemic-related lockdown measures also occurred only in spring 2022, after the subsidence of the Omicron variant. Accordingly, in 2022, the mis-match in the goods sector was succeeded by a mis-match in the services sector, with demand for contact-intensive services rising more quickly than supply capacity in the immediate aftermath of the full post-pandemic reopening that spring.
Subsequently, the improvement in supply capacity and the unwinding of the adverse terms of trade shock has both supported economic activity and contributed to disinflation. In particular, the normalisation of demand and the expansion in supply capacity reduced these sectoral mismatches. After peaking in 2021, supply chain bottlenecks gradually eased during the course of 2022 and 2023, contributing to a decline in the relative price of goods. The decline in energy demand and the increase in energy supply capacity, together with the contribution from the various subsidy schemes that limited the impact of the shocks on retail energy prices, meant that energy prices fell by 14 per cent between their peak in October 2022 and July 2023.
The easing of bottlenecks and the decline in the relative price of energy also helped to calm food inflation and, via lower cost pressures, services inflation.[18]In addition, the reversal of the adverse supply shocks also boosted activity and employment, with the fading of the pandemic in particular supporting activity in 2021 and 2022, and falling energy prices and the receding impact of past bottlenecks boosting activity in 2023 and 2024. Compared to a purely demand-driven inflation episode, the nature of this inflation shock limited the extent to which disinflation would necessarily be accompanied by a severe economic contraction: rather, the aim of monetary policy was to make sure that demand grew more slowly than supply capacity during the disinflation phase.
The euro area implementation of the Bernanke-Blanchard model provides a useful organising device to represent the contribution of sectoral shocks.[19]The left panel of Chart 14 shows that shocks to energy and food prices, together with pandemic-related shortages, accounted for the largest part of the 2021-2022 inflation surges and the subsequent disinflation can largely be attributed to the fading of these shocks. In contrast, labour market tightness has played a comparatively minor role in inflation dynamics.
The right panel of Chart 14 shows that the phase of above-target inflation has primarily been prolonged by the lagged adjustment of wages (and prices) to the initial inflation shocks. The aim of monetary tightening has been to contain this adjustment phase by making sure that the post-shock rounds of wage and price adjustments were limited by dampened demand and underpinned by stable longer-term inflation expectations.
According to this analytical framework, the bulk of disinflation could be expected to take place relatively quickly with the fading of the sectoral shocks, but full convergence back to the target would be slower due to the lagged nature of wage adjustments and the staggered pattern of economy-wide price adjustments to cost increases. In turn, these characteristics of the disinflation process (an initial rapid phase, followed by a slower convergence phase) have informed the calibration of monetary tightening.
The nature of the disinflation process has been recognised in the Eurosystem staff projections. For instance, the December 2022 projections foresaw that inflation would decline from the quarterly peak of 10 per cent in Q4 2022 to 3.6 per cent in Q4 2023, 3.3 per cent in Q4 2024 and 2.0 per cent in Q4 2025. Disinflation turned out to be even more rapid during 2023, with Q4 inflation at 2.7 per cent. The June 2024 projections foresee inflation at 2.5 per cent in Q4 2024 and 2.0 per cent in Q4 2025.
In summary, diagnosing the nature of inflation dynamics has been essential in calibrating monetary tightening. Conditional on inflation expectations remaining anchored, the fading out of the initial shocks that triggered the steep rise in inflation could be expected to deliver a two-phase disinflation process, with an initial steep decline followed by a slower convergence phase as wage-price and price-price staggered adjustment dynamics played out.[20]The role of a demand-dampening monetary stance has been to make sure that inflation did not remain too far above the target for too long and to reinforce the commitment to a timely return to the inflation target, such that price and wage-setters could focus on “backward” adjustment dynamics – aimed at recovering lost purchasing power and re-establishing optimal relative prices – without worrying about the “forward” adjustment dynamics that would be generated by any de-anchoring of inflation expectations.
Sectoral balance sheets
In calibrating the monetary stance, it is also essential to take into account that the impact of monetary policy depends on the condition of sectoral balance sheets. These encompass the balance sheets of firms, households, banks, the public sector and the rest of the world.[21]
Chart 15 shows that households had exceptionally high savings rates in 2020 and 2021. While firms were net borrowers during the initial months of the pandemic in 2020, corporate debt was contained by significant fiscal transfers and de-risked through extensive public loan guarantees. Taking a longer-term perspective, Chart 16 shows that household leverage before the pandemic had declined relative to the 2010 peak but was still elevated compared to the initial years of the euro; although there had been some decline since 2016, the pre-pandemic level of corporate leverage was much higher than at the start of the euro.
While the collapse of GDP meant that these leverage ratios jumped during 2020, both now stand well below their pre-pandemic levels, also due to the significant rise in nominal GDP. These balance sheet improvements have helped to cushion the financial impact of monetary policy tightening on households and firms. In addition, the trend shift towards fixed-rate mortgages also meant that fewer euro area households faced an immediate cash flow burden due to higher mortgage servicing costs. Moreover, in contrast to an inflation scenario in which the unwinding of a demand shock means that monetary tightening is accompanied by economic contraction, the improvement in supply capacity after the pandemic, the easing of bottlenecks and the 2023-2024 unwinding of the 2021-2022 energy shocks meant that there was underlying positive momentum in employment and output. This further contained credit risk premia, in contrast to tightening cycles triggered by excess demand episodes (often accompanied also by financial excess). One illustration is provided by Chart 17, which shows that corporate profitability was above the pre-pandemic level in 2021 and 2022, also boosted by prices adjusting more rapidly to the inflation surge than wages. While the monetary tightening and rising labour costs have seen a decline in corporate profitability, it only just returned to the pre-pandemic level in early 2024.
At the same time, the financial exposure to rising interest rates that was embedded in the holdings of non-bank financial intermediaries was ultimately held either by euro area households or the global investor community. Chart 18 shows that housing assets served as a partial inflation hedge during 2022 even if higher interests rates resulted in some reversal in valuations in 2023. At the same time, there were net capital losses on household financial portfolios during 2022. The sharp increase in inflation also eroded the real value of household deposits. The losses on financial portfolios are likely to have been disproportionately absorbed by higher-income households with relatively low marginal propensities to consume, with cushioning provided by the high share of this group in pandemic-era excess savings.[22]
In the aftermath of the 2008-2012 global and euro area crises, the resilience of the euro area banking system has been improved through a mix of higher regulatory requirements, more intensive bank supervision, the rolling-out of more extensive macroprudential regulations and greater managerial risk aversion. As an illustration, Chart 19 shows the marked improvement in capital ratios in the banking system between 2015 and 2019. Simultaneously, liquidity ratios improved significantly, further increasing the overall resilience of the banking sector. Pandemic-related excess savings by households, extensive fiscal transfers to households and firms, public loan guarantees, the reversal of the pandemic and energy shocks and low-cost funding from the ECB meant that banks did not suffer significant credit impairments during the 2020-2021 period.
The robust state of bank balance sheets meant that the transmission of rate hikes to banks could proceed in an orderly manner. In particular, the increases in risk-free rates were not amplified by an outsized increase in credit risk premia or a severe contraction in credit supply. Moreover, the capital losses on the bonds held by the banking sector were contained by the relatively low bond allocation in the asset holdings of euro area banks.[23]In a related manner, the high share of central bank reserves in the asset holdings of banks meant that the overall duration risk was relatively limited. Bank profitability improved substantially due to the shift to a higher interest rate environment and was further bolstered by the increase in interest paid on central bank reserves.[24]In effect, the resilience of the banking sector, together with the highly-liquid composition of bank assets, has increased the feasible monetary policy space by muting concerns about the financial stability impact of rate hikes.[25]The highly-liquid state of the asset side of bank balance sheets meant that losses from fixed rate mortgage assets were compensated by rising income from central bank reserve holdings.
While the level of central bank excess reserves in the euro area remains high at around €3.1 trillion, these have declined by more than a third, or €1.7 trillion, since the peak reached in the second half of 2022. This has mostly been the result of the repayment of funding from targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO), which fell from €2.2 trillion in June 2022 to a mere €76 billion in July 2024 and will reach zero in December 2024.[26]The reinvestment of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio stopped in June 2023, with the APP portfolio dropping from a peak of €3.3 trillion in June 2022 to €2.8 trillion in July 2024. The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) portfolio started to shrink in July, with the intention to discontinue reinvestments altogether at the end of this year.
From a macroeconomic perspective, the transition from a high-reserves environment to a lower-reserves environment can trigger a shift in the risk-taking strategies of banks (vis-a-vis both lending and bond purchasing), in relation to a decline in the stock of reserves that might have been expected to remain in the banking system for an extended period as the funding counterparts to asset purchase programmes or long-term refinancing operations (sometimes described as “non-borrowed” reserves).[27][28][29]
Directionally, this contraction in liquidity may have contributed to the relatively-strong decline in lending volumes in the euro area during this tightening episode. In particular, estimates by ECB staff suggest that banks with lower excess liquidity are more likely to reduce their supply of credit in response to policy rate hikes, and the increase in their lending rates is likely to be larger. This means that, as aggregate liquidity shrinks, the transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending may strengthen further.
The counterpart to the insulation of household, bank and corporate balance sheets during the pandemic was an expansion in sovereign debt (see Chart 20). The surprise inflation, together with the output recovery, has partially offset the increase in debt-output ratios but these remain above their pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the considerable fiscal response to the energy shock in 2022 increased public debt levels, even if many of these temporary measures have now been reversed. Naturally, an integrated view of the consolidated public sector balance sheet should take into account the decline in the net equity position of central banks but any evaluation of the impact of monetary tightening via this channel will depend on the specification of the relevant counterfactual scenario.
Despite some volatility episodes, the combination of higher policy rates, quantitative tightening and an increase in public debt levels has not triggered a substantial increase in sovereign risk premia in the euro area, while so far there has only been a limited increase in term premia. This likely reflects several factors. First, as indicated by the anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, this inflation episode has been interpreted throughout as a temporary phase, with a sufficient response from central banks to ensure that the initial inflation shocks do not mutate into permanent inflation. In turn, this has meant that longer-term bond yields rose by less than shorter-term interest rates Second, the 2020 launch of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme of joint debt and grants caused a reassessment of country-level risk premia by investors, in view of the solidarity demonstrated by EU Member States in the face of a severe tail risk. Third, the flexible design of the 2020 PEPP and 2022 announcement of the transmission protection instrument (TPI) provided reassurance to investors that unwarranted, disorderly dynamics in sovereign debt markets posing a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy would not be tolerated, provided that countries comply with a set of established “prudent policy” criteria.
Finally, it is important to take into account the external balance sheet of the euro area, in view of its role in the international transmission of domestic and foreign monetary tightening. In line with the impact of the severe decline in the terms of trade on import payments relative to export revenues, Chart 15 shows that the current account surplus of the euro area declined between the middle of 2021 and early 2023, which is also reflected in the decline in the net international investment position during this period, temporarily interrupting the rising trend observed since 2013, in Chart 21. Aside from the terms of trade channel, the global nature of the inflation shock and the similar monetary policy responses across countries meant that the composition of foreign assets and foreign liabilities played only a limited role in determining the international impact of monetary tightening. For instance, debt-related international investment income inflows and outflows increased by similar amounts between 2021 and 2024.
Of course, taking a wider perspective, the global element of the inflation shock and the monetary policy response has shaped the disinflation process and the calibration of monetary policy. All else equal, the tightening moves by foreign central banks limited the required scale of domestic monetary tightening by slowing down global activity, containing globally-determined commodity prices and pushing up the common component in term premia. At the same time, if domestic monetary tightening had been too limited relative to foreign monetary tightening, exchange rate depreciation might have exerted a larger influence on the domestic disinflation process.
Conclusions
At the time of writing (August 2024), my interim assessment of the effectiveness of ECB monetary policy in responding to the 2021-2022 inflation surges is that there has been good progress in delivering the overriding goal of making sure that inflation returns to target in a timely manner. Crucially, this disinflation process has been underpinned by the forceful transmission of monetary policy to the financial system, the level of demand and inflation expectations.
This has required the ECB to appropriately calibrate its monetary policy stance to ensure that demand has been sufficiently dampened and the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations sufficiently protected, while also containing the economic costs of a restrictive monetary stance. Among other factors, this calibration needed to take into account: the “re-anchoring from below” of medium-term inflation expectations and the associated pricing-out of low-for-long rate scenarios; the multiple channels by which the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine directly served to moderate demand; the inflation-disinflation cycles generated by the pandemic and the energy shock; the interactions between monetary policy and sectoral balance sheets; and the global dimensions of the inflation shock and the international policy response.
Of course, this assessment is necessarily interim: the return to target is not yet secure. In particular, the monetary stance will have to remain in restrictive territory for as long as is needed to shepherd the disinflation process towards a timely return to the target. Equally, the return to target needs to be sustainable: a rate path that is too high for too long would deliver chronically below-target inflation over the medium term and would be inefficient in terms of minimising the side effects on output and employment. The data-dependent challenge for monetary policy will be to chart the sustainable and efficient path to the target."

Welcome address by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Joint ECB-IMF-IMFER Conference 2024
Frankfurt am Main, 23 July 2024
I am pleased to welcome you to this research conference, jointly organised by the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the IMF Economic Review. The focus of this conference on new global challenges for international fiscal and monetary policy is directly relevant to the work of the ECB. Policy institutions rely on academic research for the analytical foundations that guide our economic and financial assessments and our policy decisions[1].
In looking at the programme for this conference, I was impressed by the progress that is evident across several research dimensions. The combination of methodological developments and the increased availability of granular data is facilitating much richer analysis and more informative quantitative estimation of the impact of various types of shocks and, crucially, the impact of various types of policy measures.[2]In particular, it is increasingly feasible to move beyond representative-agent, representative-product macroeconomic models by incorporating various types of heterogeneity.
Heterogeneity matters across many dimensions – I will list just a few examples. The consumption and labour supply decisions of households differ across income brackets and lifecycle stages.[3]The pricing, investment, production and financing decisions of corporations depends on the size distribution and balance sheets of individual firms. The exposure of a firm to a sectoral shock depends on the patterns of complementarities and substitution possibilities across sectors, in addition to where the firm is located in the production network – whether it is upstream or downstream of the affected sector.[4]The vulnerability of a region to an external shock depends not only on direct trade linkages but also on exposures via integrated supply chains. Similarly, the impact of a financial shock depends on the nature of the frictions that determine access to finance, together with the network of bilateral financial linkages that lie beneath the international financial system. Of course, any individual research contribution will have to focus on the types of heterogeneity that are most relevant for the question being studied – not all types of heterogeneity are equally important for all shocks.
From my perspective, it is essential that the ECB both supports these research developments and incorporates the emerging insights into the policy process. In terms of macroeconomic analysis, a range of multi-sectoral, multi-country and heterogeneous-agent models are in development at the ECB.[5]
In terms of the information set that forms the basis for our monetary policy meetings, surveys are playing an increasingly prominent role. Typically, these are analysed in combination with bank-level, firm-level and household-level datasets. The surveys conducted by the ECB are central to the policy process: the bank lending survey (BLS); the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE); the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS); the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS); the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES); the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA); and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).[6]More recently, the European System of Central Banks has developed the Distributional Wealth Accounts, a dataset that provides new experimental quarterly statistics on household wealth.[7]
With respect to wages, the newly-developed ECB wage tracker is based on granular data on collective bargaining agreements, allowing the ECB to interpret the latest signals on developments in wages in the euro area and conduct sectoral analysis that can shed light on the connection between wages and prices.[8]In addition, micro price data can enhance our understanding of how firms set prices.[9]The analytical and policy value of these surveys and granular datasets is increasing in the breadth and credibility of research that provides a guide to understanding the macroeconomic impact of heterogeneity.[10]I am confident that the papers presented at this conference will make a valuable contribution to advancing this exciting research programme.
The wider availability of timely granular information on balance sheets, millions of individual loans and their lending rates (for example in the European AnaCredit credit register) and deposit rates for euro area monetary financial institutions has offered increasingly detailed insights into bank-based transmission. We now have evidence that firm and bank balance sheet constraints can amplify the contraction in credit availability brought about by policy tightening.[11]Access to granular survey data, for example the individual replies to the bank lending survey, also helps disentangle credit supply from demand to understand the transmission of shocks to the real economy via banks.[12]More recently, the availability of security-level data as well as loan- and transaction-level information on banks and firms has further enhanced the analysis of the monetary policy transmission mechanism along several dimensions, including: heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy across regions and sectors; the impact of monetary policy on bank risk-taking; and the sources of changes in credit developments.[13][14]"

Keynote speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the National Conference of Statistics on official statistics at the time of artificial intelligence
Rome, 4 July 2024
It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) from a central bank’s perspective.[1]
The world is witnessing extraordinary advances in the field of AI.[2]We are moving from analytical AI models designed to perform specific tasks[3]to generative AI models capable of creating human-like content.
The burgeoning interest in generative AI has boosted AI adoption.[4]A recent international survey revealed that almost three-quarters of organisations had adopted AI for one or more business functions, and around two-thirds of them are using generative AI. Nevertheless, just 8% reported using AI for five or more business functions – suggesting that we are still in the initial stages of AI integration.[5]
AI can be applied to a wide spectrum of activities, from routine and repetitive tasks to knowledge-based and creative work. It has been argued that AI is a general-purpose technology – akin to the steam engine, electricity or the computer – with the potential to transform our economies in the long run.[6]
But, like the computer before it, AI may involve a paradox similar to the one made famous by the economist Robert Solow: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”[7]
The dawn of the computer era sawinformation and communication technology (ICT) profoundly alter our personal lives and the economy. Today, our workplaces, homes and social lives are interwoven with digitalisation.
At the European Central Bank (ECB), our Information Systems department has become the largest business area within the institution. ICT has become key to our core tasks, from the economic models that underpin our forecasts to monetary policy implementation and the operation of market infrastructures.
Yet technology has not fundamentally changed the way we think about monetary policy. Moreover, just as Solow observed, the macroeconomic impact of ICT on productivity has not been as large as might have been expected – at least outside of the tech sector.
Indeed, the transformative potential of AI may not always be productivity-enhancing. Consider, for example, a recent AI-generated deepfake video of the actor Tom Cruise dressed in a bathrobe and singing Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” to Paris Hilton that went viral on TikTok.[8]
Might we see another Solow paradox emerge in the context of AI? In other words, what is the potential of AI to boost the productive capacity of the economy, as well as that of central banks?
Today I will take stock of what we know about the impact ofAI on the economy and discuss its possible implications for our monetary policy. I will then share the ECB’s perspective on how we can best use AI in our central banking tasks, while putting in place the necessary safeguards for its responsible use.
The macroeconomic impact of AI and its implications for monetary policy
AI could affect the economy in several areas that are particularly relevant for the conduct of monetary policy. Today I will highlight just three of them.
The first area relates to productivity.
The potential of AI to raise productivity is undeniable – from acting as a powerful coding assistant to running autonomous “smart factories”. AI could increase productivity through various channels – for example, via direct productivity effects that boost total factor productivity or through individual production factors.
Indeed, several studies already point to sizeable AI-induced productivity gains at firm level.[9]But estimates of aggregate effects over the coming decade differ markedly across studies – from an increase in annual total factor productivity growth of less than 0.1 percentage points to annual labour productivity growth of up to 1.5 percentage points.[10]
The eventual outcome will depend on whether we see a rapid and broad-based adoption and diffusion of AI across all sectors of the economy. Up until now, the sheer speed of diffusion across sectors and firms has little historical precedent.[11]And survey evidence suggests that adoption by European firms nearly matches that of North America.[12]
But a key risk stems from the possibility that most of the value created by AI is extracted by a few companies that end up dominating the AI ecosystem.[13]This is a key reason why productivity gains from AI at firm level may not translate into sustained value-added gains at the aggregate level, as market power increases costs. We saw this happen already with the rise of IT[14], which resulted in productivity gains being concentrated in the IT sector and primarily benefiting countries with large, successful tech firms. This is also reflected in the unprecedented concentration of market value in the “Magnificent Seven” firms in the United States.[15]These are currently benefiting from the AI boom and making higher yearly profits than all the listed companies of France, Germany and Italy combined.
This has important implications for Europe. As Mario Draghi recently observed, EU productivity growth over the past twenty years would have been on a par with that of the United States if it were not for the tech sector.[16]Current data point to the euro area trailing behind the United States in terms of private investment in AI[17], as well as patent applications and journal publications in the field.[18]It is therefore critical to devise a European AI strategy with a threefold aim: to preserve competition in the AI space[19]; to create an ecosystem that supports’ European AI firms’ competitiveness, generating sectoral productivity gains over time[20]; and to support the diffusion of AI across the economy, facilitating the development of AI-supported products and services.[21]
The labour market is the second area of the economy that is likely to be affected by AI.[22]
New technologies can substitute or complement labour. On the one hand, automation implies capital taking over a task previously performed by a worker. On the other, productivity tends to increase with the automation of tasks, which may contribute to increased labour demand for non-automated tasks if price reduction brought about by productivity-improving technology spurs strong demand growth.[23]And new technology can lead to the creation of new kinds of jobs.[24]Whether AI represents an opportunity or risk for employment depends on the net effect.
ECB staff analysis suggests that around 25% of jobs in European countries are in occupations that are highly exposed to AI-enabled automation, while another 30% have a medium degree of exposure.[25]Other research finds that knowledge-intensive services in particular – including finance and insurance, advertising, consultancy and IT – are most likely to be affected by AI.[26]
Initial evidence for Europe suggests that, on average, occupations more exposed to AI have seen an increase in their share in total employment – although mostly for highly skilled occupations and younger workers, and with significant heterogeneity across countries.[27]But the ultimate impact on employment remains uncertain and is likely to hinge on equipping the workforce withskills that complement AI.[28]
The third area of the economy that may be affected by AI is financial stability.
Certainly, AI can bring benefits to the table. The application of AI could allow banks to conduct more efficient risk assessments and capital and liquidity planning.[29]But there are also risks. If new AI tools are used widely in the financial system and AI suppliers are concentrated, operational risk, market concentration and too-big-to-fail externalities may increase. Furthermore, widespread AI adoption could heighten the potential for herd behaviour, market correlation, deception, manipulation and conflicts of interest.[30]
Central banks, including the ECB, are monitoring these developments closely.[31]Not only does AI influence the environment in which we operate, it also affects how that environment interacts with our monetary policy.
First, AI could affect cost pressures in the economy in both directions.
We may see AI exerting downward pressure on prices in various ways. For instance, if the net effect of AI is that it substitutes labour and increases productivity, we could see a reduced risk of labour shortages and downward pressure on unit labour cost growth. This is especially relevant in the euro area, where unemployment is at a record low and the working age population is projected to decline by 19% by the end of the century as a result of population ageing.[32]
AI could also lead to a decline in energy prices through its impact on the supply side, for instance through enhanced grid management and more efficient energy consumption. And it could provide consumers with better tools for price comparison.
But AI could also create upward price pressures.
For instance, the uptake of AI will also have an impact on global energy demand, with the computational power required for sustaining AI’s rise doubling every 100 days.[33]This could push up energy costs. Moreover, AI may encourage discriminatory pricing by facilitating the real-time analysis of consumer demand and price elasticities. And algorithms consistently learn to charge collusive prices that are higher than competitive ones, even without communicating with one another – in part by exploiting well-known biases that deviate from rational consumer behaviour.[34]
Second, we may see AI affect monetary policy transmission.
AI is likely to create new winners and losers in the labour and capital market, with consequences for income and wealth distribution.[35]This matters for monetary policy because it can influence people’s marginal propensity to consume and their access to credit, which in turn affect how demand responds to changes in monetary policy.
Moreover, if AI leads to a change in financial structures, such as an increase in non-bank intermediation,[36]it may have further implications for monetary policy transmission. There is evidence to suggest that compared with banks, non-banks are more responsive to monetary policy measures that influence longer-term interest rates, such as asset purchases. Non-banks also exhibit higher levels of credit, liquidity and duration risk compared with the banking sector.[37]
Third, AI may go on to influence the natural rate of interest.[38]
If AI boosts productivity growth and potential output, we may see upward pressure being exerted on the natural rate of interest, as demand increases for capital to invest in new technologies and expand production capabilities.
But if AI leads to higher rates of labour displacement and causes rising income inequality, we may see some downward pressure on the natural rate, owing to an increase in precautionary savings and a subsequent boost to the supply of loanable funds.
Using AI in central banking: AI at the ECB
These developments will play out over time outside the walls of the ECB, and we will be monitoring them closely. But within the ECB’s walls, AI also has the potential to help with multiple tasks.[39]
Let me give you a few examples.
Given that we are here at the National Conference of Statistics, it is fitting to begin with statistics. The ECB needs trustworthy and high-quality statistical products, services and a wide range of data to inform its monetary policy decisions.
A key lesson from the global financial crisis was that aggregate statistics alone are insufficient to grasp the complexity of financial markets. We need more granular data.
As you can imagine, the resulting datasets are so vast in terms of the number of observations they contain that collecting and disseminating them requires the use of statistical processes and analytical methods that surpass traditional statistical approaches.
Around six years ago the ECB began exploring the application of AI to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its statistical processes. And these efforts are reaping dividends.
We use AI to improve the quality of our datasets, from identifying and matching observations across datasets to using modern machine learning techniques for quality assurance.[40]
Moreover, large language models (LLMs) can support statistical processes in ways that were once simply not feasible. These include unlocking new and non-traditional data sources – for instance, unstructured data like text, image, video or audio. These sources can complement and enhance our existing data collections.
AI is also increasingly being incorporated into the economic analyses we carry out to help us prepare our monetary policy decisions.
AI can identify patterns in data more effectively than traditional methods. This is particularly true for non-linearities, which have been playing a bigger role in an environment that is becoming more shock prone. AI also enables the real-time analysis of economic indicators, helping central banks to make more timely policy decisions – a particularly valuable capability in times of crisis.
What do these applications look like in practice?
ECB staff use AI to nowcast inflation. This includes web-scraping price data and using LLMs for data classification. We are currently exploring the use of Big Data and new generative AI models in close cooperation with the BIS Innovation Hub.[41]
Staff are also applying machine learning models to euro area inflation forecasting, accounting for possible non-linearities.[42]These models are already performing well compared with our conventional forecast and survey-based measures of inflation expectations. Another project is employing machine learning techniques to nowcast global trade.[43]
Staff are also exploring the possibilities opened up by innovative datasets. For instance, projects include using a combination of text data and machine learning techniques to quantify risks and tensions in the global economy and exploring the use of satellite data to track economic activity.[44]
Central bank communication is another area in which AI can contribute.
AI could help in areas where central bank communication is key, such as ensuring that policy decisions are well understood and keeping inflation expectations anchored. With AI, we can rapidly analyse vast volumes of media reporting and market commentary.
Moreover, AI can help us communicate with the public in all parts of the euro area. As a European institution, the ECB communicates in all 24 official languages of the EU. Even today, AI and machine translation are helping us meet a demand for translation that exceeds 6 million pages per year. Without those tools, the ECB’s language services would be limited to covering around 150,000 pages per year.
AI can also help broaden our reach by simplifying key messages and communication products for targeted audiences[45]that have less awareness or knowledge of the ECB.[46]And it could help us answer any questions the public may have.
All these innovations could ultimately make the ECB better understood, facilitate the effectiveness of our monetary policy and boost our accountability.
AI might also bring profound changes to the field of market infrastructures and payments.
The technology could help design and develop innovative payments services customised to consumers’ needs and preferences. And it could help foster financial inclusion, for example, by facilitating voice activated payments. These potential developments are clearly relevant when it comes to the ECB’s role in promoting efficient, integrated and inclusive payments.
Moreover, AI could also help us oversee payment systems. There is an opportunity to use AI as part of early warning models that aim to identify financial stability risks related to financial market infrastructures before these risks materialise. And it could play a supporting role in the scrutiny of information provided by overseen entities, helping us ensure that their practices align with the applicable regulatory frameworks.
The ECB has developed an AI action plan to facilitate the adoption of AI wherever it is relevant to our tasks. It aims to develop and deploy the necessary AI tools and infrastructure, while fostering AI skills and ensuring the technology is used safely and responsibly.
The limits of AI: putting the necessary safeguards in place
Let me now turn to the limits of AI.
A key strength of human intelligence is the ability to reflect on its limits. As the philosopher Immanuel Kant once wrote, “we can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them”.[47]But AI does not have this capacity for self-reflection. Nor does it have the ability to produce its own safeguards independently of human critical thinking. We therefore need to be aware of the limits of AI and their implications for the ECB, so that we can put the necessary guardrails in place.
First, we need to ensure confidentiality and privacy.
Given the sensitivity of central banks’ decisions, guaranteeing confidentiality is a key condition for the in-house use of AI. Likewise, when it comes to data use, AI will increase concerns about privacy, underlining the importance of applying technological and governance safeguards and complying with regulations such as the EU AI Act.
Take, for instance, the AI solutions we use for our statistics. These tools need to provide comprehensive documentation. This is a prerequisite for clarifying how AI solutions have been used to assess, improve or integrate data. Trust in these solutions comes from first understanding them.
The second risk stemming from AI is the degree to which it can be used to spread false information and data, facilitate fraud or launch cyberattacks.
Since late 2022 there has been a 53-fold increase in generative AI-related incidents and hazards reported in the media.[48]It is one thing for an AI-generated deepfake video of Tom Cruise to go viral. But it is quite another when a deepfake of a policymaker goes viral – particularly at moments of crisis, when attention levels are high and volatility and uncertainty are already pronounced.
At the same time, AI can be used to detect and address such risks. It can help prevent and detect cyberattacks by identifying anomalies in user, system and network behaviours in real time.[49]
The third risk emerges from what we might describe as an over-arching dependence on AI. And this can manifest itself in several ways.
For instance, a greater dependence on AI may inadvertently increase the risk of falling into an “echo chamber” trap.
Given that LLMs are trained using available data and information – which, over time, will increasingly be produced by AI – there is a risk of AI becoming self-referential or repeating existing biases.
To the extent that this dynamic increases the impact of central bank communication on markets, while central banks look to the markets for information, it could increase the risk of central bank echo chambers emerging.[50]This could, for instance, increase the risks of using forward guidance.[51]
An excessive reliance on AI could also reduce our own operational resilience.
As AI becomes a bigger part of our way of working, we may find ourselves growing more dependent on it for core tasks. That is why it is so important to understand the properties of the AI algorithms and models we use to reduce the risks of a potential “black box” effect.
Similarly, if it is not used responsibly, AI could also suppress the diversity and originality of thought, thereby increasing the risk of groupthink and confirmation bias. The mathematician Alan Turing once famously asked, “Can machines think?”[52]The last thing we want is for the same question to be asked about central bankers who end up being too reliant on AI.
A key feature of human cognition is the ability to question existing theories, produce new ones and identify data to test them.[53]This ability needs to be preserved. ECB Governing Council meetings are best understood as a process of comparing views on the economy, considering alternative interpretations of economic developments and assessing risks from multiple perspectives. The ongoing uncertainty in the economy shows that we need to do this more, rather than less.
The overall lesson is that humans need to remain firmly in control, not only to ensure a trustworthy use of AI systems, but also to address questions of accountability and maintain the public’s trust in the central bank.
Conclusion
To conclude, as we enter the AI age, we face the challenge of realising its potential while managing its risks.
Whether AI will show up in productivity statistics or create a new paradox remains uncertain. To an extent, whether we face an AI productivity paradox will partly depend on our ability to accurately measure its contribution – and statisticians have an important role to play given the complexity of measuring intangible capital.[54]
But as with other technologies, for AI to be able to produce its full effects, the right ecosystem must be in place – one that facilitates competition in the AI sphere, ensures a fair distribution of possible productivity gains, establishes robust regulatory and ethical safeguards and fosters the corresponding skills in the labour market.
For central banks, AI offers opportunities for innovation and efficiency gains, from economic analysis to communication. But there are also risks that must be considered, and we are duly building appropriate safeguards.
As we integrate AI into our processes, we must ensure that human judgement and critical thinking remain at the forefront. This balance will be essential to maintaining trust in our data, our decisions and the broader financial system.
Thank you."

Introductory speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the opening reception of the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal
Sintra, 1 July 2024
First of all, I would like to welcome you all to this year’s ECB Forum.
The theme of the conference is “Monetary policy in an era of transformation”, and we have a rich programme ahead of us, exploring the changes that are taking place.
But even if most of us can agree that the economy is undergoing substantial change, I imagine there are more diverging views about where it will end up.
This lack of clarity presents a profound challenge for policymakers, as we must try at once to understand these transformations and to steer the economy through them.
Indeed, much of the policy challenge over the last few years has involved stabilising inflation while facing fundamental uncertainty about the economy.
Nevertheless, we have managed to chart a path through this uncertainty, and we have come a long way in the fight against inflation.
In October 2022, inflation peaked at 10.6%. By September 2023, the last time we raised rates, it had fallen by more than half, to 5.2%. And then after nine months of holding rates steady, we saw inflation halve again to 2.6%, which led us to cut rates for the first time in June.
Our work is not done, and we need to remain vigilant. But this progress allows us to look back and reflect on the path we have taken.
This evening I would like to talk about three specific features that have defined this policy cycle: the risks, the path and the costs.[1]
The risks
Let me start with the risks.
In a typical policy cycle, when fluctuations are driven by moderate and short-lived shocks, inflation expectations are usually not at risk. Central banks’ price stability mandates and reaction functions ensure confidence in the inflation target.
When faced with typical demand shocks, central banks reach their target by stabilising demand around potential output. And when faced with supply shocks, central banks can in principle “look through” them, as these shocks will usually leave no lasting imprint on inflation.
But this low risk to inflation expectations only applies when shocks are indeed moderate and short-lived. In situations where there is a risk of shocks becoming larger and more persistent, inflation expectations can de-anchor regardless of whether the shocks are demand-led or supply-led.
Central banks must then react forcefully to prevent above-target inflation becoming entrenched.
This was the lesson of the 1970s, when a sequence of supply shocks caused by rising oil prices ultimately morphed into a lasting inflationary shock. And with central banks at the time being seen as ambivalent about bringing down inflation, people revised their expectations about medium-term inflation.
Different studies reach different conclusions about the origin of the current inflation episode. ECB analysis finds that, at the peak, supply shocks were three times more important than demand shocks in explaining the deviation of inflation from its mean.[2]Other research puts a greater emphasis on demand shocks.[3]
But this delineation between supply and demand, while relevant, has not been the most important factor in our current cycle.
We needed to base our decisions not only on the source of the shocks, but also on their size and persistence. This was because the shocks were so large and persistent that we faced a genuine risk to inflation expectations.
Two features could have provided fertile ground for people to lose confidence in the monetary anchor.
First, the shocks were large enough to make many households switch their attention to inflation. At the start of 2023, over 60% of respondents in our consumer expectations survey reported that they were paying more attention to inflation than in the past.[4]
Second, the inflationary impact of the shocks risked becoming endogenously persistent, owing mainly to the staggered wage bargaining process in the euro area. Although there is large variation across countries, the average duration of wage contracts is two years, effectively guaranteeing a drawn-out process to “catch up” with past inflation.[5]
We did see some signs that the anchoring of inflation expectations was becoming more vulnerable, especially via a fattening of the “right tail” of the distribution. In October 2022, around four in ten consumers expected medium-term inflation to be at or above 5% and professional forecasters assigned a 30% probability of inflation being at or above 3% two years later.[6]
So, monetary policy had to send a strong signal that permanent overshoots of the inflation target would not be tolerated. As a result, we strongly emphasised our determination to ensure a “timely” return to target. Our aim was to convey our commitment to ensuring that the period of high inflation would be limited and signal a sense of urgency.
The path
But how does monetary policy anchor inflation expectations? It is not only about the policy destination, but also about setting the right trajectory of rates to get there.
This brings me to the second specific feature of this cycle: the rate path.
It was clear from the outset that merely communicating our commitment to reaching our target would not have been enough. ECB analysis shows that, if we had not reacted at all, the risk of de-anchoring would have been above 30% in 2023 and 2024.[7]
It is likely that even moderate policy action would have been insufficient. For example, if rates had stopped at 2%, the risk of de-anchoring would still have been around 24%.
So, when we first started raising rates, we knew that we were far from where we needed to be. The most important factor was therefore to close the gap as quickly as possible. This is why we had a historically steep climb at the start of our rate path, using increments of 75 and 50 basis points for our first six rate increases.
But as policy rates moved towards restrictive territory, the challenge shifted from acting quickly to calibrating the path precisely. In particular, we needed to set a rate path that both delivered a “timely” return to 2% and did so with a high degree of confidence.
This path also required us to take a different approach from the past.
Faced with multiple large shocks, there was significant uncertainty about how to interpret and rank the information we were receiving from the economy.
On the one hand, it would have been risky to rely too much on models trained on historical data, as those data may no longer have been valid. We could not know, for instance, whether shifts in preferences, higher energy prices and geopolitics had changed the structure of the economy.
On the other hand, relying too much on current data might have been equally misleading if they had turned out to have little predictive power for the medium term. As shocks worked their way through the economy, current data could also have reflected lags more than actual inflation trends.
So we constructed a framework to hedge against this uncertainty, blending projections with current data about underlying inflation and monetary transmission. The aim was to combine various pieces of information about the medium-term outlook into a single assessment that could be updated swiftly.
Our forecasts provided a comprehensive assessment of future inflation, assuming the underlying parameters of the economy remained stable. At the same time, looking at current data allowed us to identify the persistent components of inflation and account for structural changes that might have been missing from our forecast models.[8]
In this reaction function, our assessment of the inflation outlook is informed by, but not limited to, our projections. We use various measures to gauge underlying inflation. And when assessing the strength of monetary policy, we consider banks, capital markets and the real economy.
As a result, while the flow of new information constantly adds to and improves our picture of medium-term inflation, we are not pushed around by any specific data point. Data dependence does not mean data point dependence.
This framework helped us navigate the “tightening” and “holding” phases of our policy cycle, and it gave us the confidence to deliver a first rate cut at our last policy meeting.
During these phases, we have seen the “right tail” of the distribution of inflation expectations narrow, consistent with a timely return of inflation to target.
The costs
But while our policy path has helped to tame inflation, it has also dampened economic growth. Interest rates rose steadily and remained high while the economy was stagnating for five straight quarters.
This pattern is unavoidable when central banks face shocks that push inflation and output in opposing directions. But this time, the costs of disinflation have been contained compared with similar episodes in the past.
This brings me to the third specific feature of this cycle.
Given the magnitude of the shock to inflation, a “soft landing” is still not guaranteed. If we look at historical rate cycles since 1970, we can see that when major central banks hiked interest rates while energy prices were high, the costs for the economy were usually quite steep.[9]
Only around 15% of the successful soft landings in this period – defined as avoiding either a recession or a major deterioration of employment – have been achieved following energy price shocks.
But this cycle has so far not followed past patterns.
Inflation peaked at a much higher point than during previous soft landings, but it also decelerated faster. Growth has remained within the range of previous soft landing episodes, albeit near the bottom of that range. And the performance of the labour market has been exceptionally benign.
Employment has grown despite slowing GDP growth, rising by 2.6 million people since the end of 2022. And unemployment is at historical lows for the euro area, and well within the range observed during previous soft landings across major economies.
The resilience of the labour market is itself a reflection of the unusual mix of shocks that have hit the euro area, with labour shortages leading firms to hoard more labour, and higher profits and lower real wages making it easier for them to do so.[10]
As a result, the usual propagation from slower growth to heightened unemployment risks and lower demand did not happen to the same extent.
Now, we are still facing several uncertainties regarding future inflation, especially in terms of how the nexus of profits, wages and productivity will evolve and whether the economy will be hit by new supply-side shocks. And it will take time for us to gather sufficient data to be certain that the risks of above-target inflation have passed.
The strong labour market means that we can take time to gather new information, but we also need to be mindful of the fact that the growth outlook remains uncertain. All of this underpins our determination to be data dependent and to take our policy decisions meeting by meeting.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Our policy decisions have successfully kept inflation expectations anchored, and inflation is projected to return to 2% in the latter part of next year. Considering the size of the inflation shock, this unwinding is remarkable in many ways.
Even though millions of businesses and workers have been independently striving to protect their profits and incomes, our 2% inflation target has remained credible and has continued to anchor the inflation process.
This speaks to the value of the policy frameworks that central banks have built up over the last 30 years, focusing on price stability and central bank independence. And it is why we will not waver from our commitment to bring inflation back down to our target for the benefit of all Europeans.
As the late footballer and manager Sir Bobby Robson said, “the first 90 minutes are the most important”. Similarly, we will not rest until the match is won and inflation is back at 2%."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Bank of Finland’s International Monetary Policy Conference
Helsinki, 26 June 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to discuss the modern role of monetary analysis at the ECB.[1]I will first review how monetary analysis has advanced over the twenty-five year history of the euro. Second, I will discuss how monetary analysis contributed to the assessment of financing conditions during the pandemic. Third, I will explain how monetary analysis has informed the diagnosis of the post-pandemic surges in inflation. Fourth, I will examine the contributions of monetary analysis to the calibration of the tightening cycle. Finally, I will speculate on the future role of monetary analysis.
The evolving role of monetary analysis
The initial monetary policy strategy of the ECB was based on a two-pillar framework to identify risks to price stability: economic analysis and monetary analysis. The two analytical domains essentially provided complementary perspectives on the economy.[2]
For the monetary pillar, the ECB’s Governing Council initially chose to emphasise the quantity of money among the key indicators to be closely monitored and established a reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate (M3).[3]
This approach was in line with the views of early-day monetarists who considered money growth the primary source of inflation. Milton Friedman famously captured this in the adage that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. In an admittedly restrictive interpretation of Friedman’s statement, this is reflected in the quantity identity MV=PY.[4]This school of thought saw money as an imperfect substitute for a wide range of financial and real assets. A policy-induced injection of money into the economy would trigger complex and inter-related portfolio rebalancing across asset categories. This rebalancing would then lead to widespread changes in asset prices, yields and spreads across the economy. These mechanisms are well described in the classic 1988 monetarist account of transmission by Karl Brunner and Alan Meltzer.[5]
Especially after the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1973, some stability-oriented central banks – most notably the Deutsche Bundesbank – were looking for a substitute anchor, and these monetarist considerations played a significant role in the conduct of monetary policy throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The result of that intellectual legacy was the prominent role that the ECB assigned to a reference value for money growth as an anchor back in 1998.[6]Deviations from that reference value and the associated “monetary overhang/shortfall” were, at the time, generally considered to signal risks to price stability.
However, a consistent record of difficulties within central banks in interpreting swings in monetary aggregates and in relying on them for predicting inflation at the horizons relevant for monetary policy contributed to a declining emphasis on money in policy making. As early as 1983, Bank of Canada Governor Gerald Bouey famously quipped “I would not say that we abandoned M1; I would say that M1 abandoned us, because of changes in banking practices”.[7]Even though Bouey was speaking about M1, the same instability problem applied to M3.
Moreover, by the time Michael Woodford came to write his seminal textInterest and Pricesin 2003, there was a wide-spread view that it was not necessary to incorporate money in modern macroeconomic models.[8]Rather, the monetary policy stance could be summarised by the setting of interest rates alone.[9]Accordingly, money was all but removed from the modern monetary economics synthesis.
Against this background, the ECB conducted a review of its monetary policy strategy in 2003. This resulted in a revised approach to monetary analysis under the monetary pillar, with the adoption of a broader view of the role of money in the economy and the financial system. The long-term empirical relation between money and inflation had consistently been proven unhelpful in quantifying the scale of price pressures on a meeting-by-meeting basis. This realisation led to the discontinuation of the earlier practice of reviewing the reference value for M3, with a shift towards treating money aggregates as indicator variables rather than intermediate targets for monetary policy. The 2003 strategy review also clarified that monetary analysis served as a tool for cross-checking the short to medium-term indications from the economic analysis, from a medium to long-term perspective.[10]
After 2003, two significant developments led to an increased focus of monetary analysis on monetary policy transmission. First, the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis highlighted the vulnerability of the transmission mechanism. This, in turn, prompted policymakers to place greater reliance on monetary analysis in navigating the resulting challenges. Second, the adoption of unconventional monetary policy tools by the ECB of required monetary analysis to broaden its scope to better understand the many new transmission channels that the adoption of unconventional instruments had set in motion, including the analysis of potential side effects of those measures. Overall, the shift in focus of monetary analysis towards monetary policy transmission represented a natural evolution in line with the changing monetary policy landscape.
These developments were incorporated in monetary analysis during the latest strategy review conducted in 2021. In the new framework, “economic analysis” and “monetary analysis” no longer represent distinct perspectives on inflation. Instead, the interrelations between economic developments and monetary and financial developments are explicitly integrated into the overall assessment of inflation risks and the formulation of monetary policy.[11]
Accordingly, monetary analysis has expanded from a narrow focus on the quantity of money to the wider mechanism by which monetary policy actions transmit to the financing conditions faced by households and firms in the real economy.[12]This approach often employs monetarist concepts, formalised within modern structural models, to analyse changes in spreads and asset prices linked to portfolio rebalancing across imperfectly substitutable financial assets, including money and money-type assets.[13]
Monetary analysis played a particularly salient role in policy decision-making when the policy rate approached the effective lower bound. This period saw a significant expansion of liquidity in the financial system through central bank lending programmes and outright asset purchases, underscoring the importance of informed decision-making based on monetary analysis.
In the quantity identity (MV=PY), the traditional emphasis had primarily been on the growth rate of money, M. However, the bi-variate relation between inflation and money growth had not only always been elusive but also weakened over time, before disappearing altogether in the first decade of the 2000s (Chart 1).[14]Past studies had found a significant and stable relation between broad money growth and inflation across several economies and monetary regimes. However, this relation was observed at very low frequency over extremely long periods, limiting the degree to which it can be used in practice at the meeting-by-meeting frequency required for policy decisions.[15]Moreover, research incorporating recent experiences finds that structural shifts in banking and the financial system have destabilised the relation between money supply and inflation.[16]
Precisely for these reasons, since the global financial crisis, the importance of the bank lending channel and other transmission mechanisms has become more prominent. Monetary analysis has adapted by increasing the emphasis on analysing the credit-creation process, its relation with liquidity conditions and the various frictions affecting the financial system. All these elements affect the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and thereby contribute to inflation dynamics.
From this perspective, it would be overly reductive to interpret the rise of money growth during the pandemic and the subsequent rise in inflation that is shown in Chart 1 as a causal relation. In fact, the strong money growth in the early phase of the pandemic was driven by the build-up of liquidity buffers, which is not inherently inflationary.[17]This is consistent with the view that the surges in inflation in 2021 and 2022 were mostly related to supply-side factors, such as global supply bottlenecks and increases in energy and commodity prices, rather than an increased stock of money. This view is further reinforced by the nature of the inflation shock which involved large relative price movements, whereas money-induced inflation should have been associated with a more uniform increase in prices across categories. I will return to the pandemic episode later in this speech.
The wider availability of timely granular information on balance sheets, lending rates and deposit rates for euro area monetary financial institutions has offered increasingly detailed insights into bank-based transmission. We now have evidence that firm and bank balance sheet constraints can amplify the contraction in credit availability brought about by policy tightening.[18]More recently, the availability of loan- and transaction-level information on banks and firms has further enhanced the analysis of the monetary policy transmission mechanism along several dimensions, including: heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy across regions and sectors, the impact of monetary policy on bank risk-taking, and the sources of changes in credit developments.[19]
Financing conditions during the pandemic
The pandemic period was marked by extraordinarily high liquidity demand, triggering a global dash for cash by investors. Lockdowns, social distancing measures and travel restrictions led many firms to experience a reduction in consumer demand and to reduce or halt their operations. This triggered a substantial decline in revenue for businesses across a wide range of sectors. However, firms still had to meet operating expenses and short-term obligations, such as the maintenance of inventories, payments to suppliers, salaries, taxes and fixed operational expenses. These needs showed up very clearly in the replies by banks to the ECB bank lending survey (BLS), which documented a surge in loan demand by firms to finance working capital, while financing needs linked to investment weakened considerably (Chart 2).[20]
In this environment, employment and total hours worked declined at the sharpest rates on record, with many employees being furloughed or having their working hours reduced. Consequently, salary incomes were dented. Banks across the euro area faced rising funding costs due to a climate of heightened uncertainty in the market and concerns about borrower creditworthiness. This led to a reassessment of risk, affecting not only banks but also the broader financial markets, as evidenced by the increase in corporate bond yields. In the absence of countervailing measures, banks would have struggled to secure funding, which would have limited their ability to meet the high demand for emergency loans, potentially crippling their lending capacity. Accordingly, it was crucial for our monetary policy to maintain favourable financing conditions and the effective transmission of monetary policy, in order to avert a monetary squeeze that would have exacerbated adverse effects from the pandemic on the economy and price stability.
The experience gained over the preceding decade allowed us to respond swiftly and decisively, deploying essentially two types of instruments. The first type was intended to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance and, in parallel, stem the tide of an impending meltdown in financial markets as investors were pulling back from riskier assets. Here the main measures were the recalibration of the asset purchase programme (APP) and the introduction of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).[21][22]The second group of instruments was deployed to ensure that the accommodative impulse would reach the broader economy. Notable examples include the recalibrations of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) for banks at attractive conditions.[23]These term credit operations were aimed at expanding the quantity of central bank reserves, subject to the condition that banks would lend them on and keep credit flowing to the economy. As a facilitating measure, the targeted lending programme was accompanied by a temporary easing of collateral and regulatory constraints.
The interplay between policies to keep the risk-free curve low and steady across maturities, and instruments to unclog the transmission pipes worked as intended. The economics of the portfolio rebalancing channel learned during the first wave of the APP net purchases, over the period 2015-2018, as well as the experience of the portfolio movements during the sovereign debt crisis, were instrumental for the design of the PEPP. The portfolio rebalancing channel is the key mechanism through which central bank asset purchases transmits monetary policy to the broader economy.[24]This channel functions through the principle of imperfect substitutability among financial instruments, coupled with investor preferences for certain assets, known as preferred habitats.[25]
Monetary analysis studied how portfolio allocations can change directions both across instruments and between euro-denominated domestic assets and foreign assets. Within the euro area, the APP had led to a rebalancing of bank exposures from sovereign securities towards corporate securities and from bonds to real-sector loans, easing financing conditions to corporates and households in the process.[26]The shift towards foreign assets had been more pronounced among foreign investors, who were the main selling sector counterpart in the APP during the pre-pandemic period, but it was also evident among euro area investors (Chart 3).[27]This had played a significant role in explaining the limited effect that the APP had on the expansion of broad money supply before the pandemic, a phenomenon that was similarly observed during the third round of quantitative easing in the United States (Chart 4). In other words, the APP had exerted robust monetary transmission even in the absence of a strong expansion in the money supply, because the exchange rate channel had become a powerful substitute for the traditional money-creation mechanism that worked through the liability side of bank balance sheets.
The long-standing internal monetary analysis of the factors explaining the setting of bank lending rates was critical in the recalibration of existing TLTROs during the pandemic. In particular, the pricing of the new wave of TLTROs following the outbreak of the pandemic relied on the accumulated evidence that the unconventional policies deployed by the ECB had lowered various components of bank funding costs in the aftermath of the euro area sovereign debt crisis (Chart 5).[28]Empirical estimates indicate that, in the absence of the recalibration of the targeted lending programme, the ability of banks to supply credit would have been severely affected. Importantly, the lower amount of lending to firms would have led to a significantly larger decline in employment by firms.[29]
The post-pandemic surges in inflation
The combination of extraordinarily high liquidity needs and our monetary policy measures to maintain favourable financing conditions boosted broad money growth. As a result, credit to firms and central bank purchases became the main sources of money creation. This composition reflected the broad division of tasks in the support given to the euro area economy, with the support to the corporate sector mostly channelled via bank credit (whose conditions were eased by monetary policy, government guarantees and regulatory measures) while the support to households was mostly channelled via the government sector. The latter, and thus the liquidity needs of the economy, explain the marked impact of central bank purchases on money growth in the early stages of the pandemic. In contrast to the 2015-2018 period, these purchases occurred alongside an increase in government borrowing. Such borrowing prevented the bond scarcity that large-scale asset purchases can imply, thereby averting the usual financial outflows to the rest of the world (Chart 4, left panel).
As economic activity resumed and lockdown restrictions were lifted, emergency liquidity needs declined and money growth also slowed. By October 2020, the three-month annualised growth rate of M3 had dropped to 7.5 per cent, which was about one-third of the 21.9 per cent rate seen at the peak of the lockdowns, and just somewhat above the historical average. The growth rate continued to decrease until mid-2022 even in the face of increased borrowing prompted by liquidity demands from the energy crisis. Shortly after we started hiking rates in July 2022, M3 growth even dipped into negative territory before recovering somewhat in the second half of 2023.
Inflation began to rise just as money growth slowed down. Initially, these price increases were concentrated in specific sectors, particularly affecting energy and food prices, rather than showing a broad-based increase across all goods and services, which would have been more consistent with a monetary origin for the inflation surge (Chart 6). These heterogeneous price increases align with the view that inflation was largely due to specific cost-push shocks passing through to the wider consumption basket. This perspective is supported by structural analyses identifying energy and food price shocks together with supply chain disruptions as the main culprits of the inflationary pressures.[30]It is also consistent with the interpretation that the robust money growth during the early stages of the pandemic was a result of accumulating liquidity reserves, which in turn were not inherently inflationary. Taken together, the evidence indicates that the recent inflation surge is primarily attributable to rising commodity prices and global supply constraints, rather than an expanding money supply.[31]
The surge in borrowing by firms, which peaked during the second quarter of 2020 amid the initial lockdowns, was primarily driven by need for working capital and precautionary reasons. Borrowing by firms closely matched their increases in cash reserves. Since this borrowing was not for investment purposes, it did not stimulate aggregate demand.
Household behaviour points to a similar message. Government aid to households served to cushion their reduced income rather than to increase spending: fiscal transfers only covered part of the slowdown in household income over the pandemic period. Most of the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic resulted from falling consumption, which was much larger than the drop in income (Chart 7, left panel). This decline in consumption was partly forced by the reduced consumption opportunities due to the pandemic restrictions but it is likely to have also reflected precautionary behaviour related to uncertainty about the future. The latter led to an increased preference for liquidity, and indeed a large part of household excess savings were accumulated in the form of overnight deposits, especially in the initial phases of the pandemic(Chart 7, right panel).[32]
Consumption only started to approach its pre-pandemic level by the middle of 2021, but households continued to express their willingness to maintain a higher level of savings or financial investments, a considerable part of which remained in overnight deposits. This composition also reflected the flattening yield curve and the low opportunity cost of holding those deposits.[33]
As energy and food prices began to rise, households moderated their accumulation of deposits but also reduced the real consumption of those products (Chart 8). The configuration of falling consumption and rising prices for energy and food is consistent with supply shocks driving energy and food prices rather than reflecting a surge in domestic demand.[34]In addition, falling consumption also indicates that the excess deposits accumulated during the pandemic did not lead to households being insensitive to more expensive and energy and food bills.
Chart 8 also shows that, as the economy reopened and uncertainty receded, household consumption volumes of items other than energy and food rebounded towards pre-pandemic levels despite the price increases in those items in the course of 2021 and 2022. While the configuration of rising consumption and rising prices might suggest some role for domestic demand, consumption of these items remained clearly below the previous trend. It is certainly the case that, for a given surge in supply-driven inflation, excess savings allowed households to cut consumption by less than if the supply shock had happened at a time when excess savings were lower.
The coexistence of high inflation and only a moderate consumption recovery serves to underline the scale of supply-driven cost pressures during 2021 and 2022: only a dramatic monetary and/or fiscal tightening would have been needed to eliminate the inflation surge by reducing domestic demand sufficiently (involving a severe drop in domestic incomes) to match the reduction in supply capacity.
Overall, although real private consumption and investment have rebounded in the post-pandemic period, these have not reached the levels projected in mid-2021 when excess savings were at their highest, and real private consumption continues to trail the forecasts made before the pandemic. In this context a dramatic recession would have been required to fully avoid an inflation surge.[35]
The tightening cycle
Monetary analysis has been central to the regular assessment of the state of the monetary policy transmission, which has been a key guiding principle in calibrating the speed and scale of the monetary policy tightening over the last couple of years.[36]
Focusing on the propagation of that tightening impulse through the banks, both the rate hikes that started in July 2022 and the sustained upshift in the yield curve that preceded and accompanied that process led to a significant rise in bank funding costs, initially driven by bonds and subsequently by deposit rates (Chart 9). The latter adjusted with a lag, owing to the atypical interest rate configuration during the negative rate period, but eventually aligned with our policy signal (Chart 10).
In parallel, loan volumes in the euro area have experienced a marked decline since late 2022. After dropping sharply, credit flows have remained stagnant for both loans and bonds (Chart 11, left panel). The pronounced decline in credit compared to previous hiking cycles (Chart 11, right panel) was largely due to the sharp increase in interest rates, which has significantly dampened demand, as also reflected in the ECB bank lending survey (BLS). Initially, credit demand showed some resilience, primarily driven by the liquidity needs of firms during the peak of the energy crisis. However, it began to contract in the last quarter of 2022 and continued to do so for several months after the last rate hike in September 2023. The primary drivers behind the weakness in demand were elevated interest rates and reduced recourse to credit for financing investments, which reflects the ""cost of capital” channel of monetary policy (Chart 12).
At the same time, a decline in the supply of credit from banks has also played a large role in the recent credit slowdown. Credit supply effects primarily stemmed from a decreasing willingness of banks to take risks. This, in turn, has affected lending conditions for firms and households. The start of the reimbursement phase for TLTROs and the change in the conditions applied by on TLTRO borrowings reinforced the incentives for banks to scale down loan exposures.[37]Studies using granular data to control for demand conditions indicate that increased borrowing costs for banks have resulted in a significant reduction in lending volumes. In other words, the significant decrease in loans was partly due to the tighter lending conditions, rather than being solely due to lower credit demand. Our bank lending survey corroborates this view, highlighting that heightened risk perception and reduced risk tolerance on the part of banks were significant factors influencing the tightening of credit standards during the hiking cycle.
In parallel, money growth, which had been declining rapidly from its 2021 peak, saw its decline accelerate, mirroring the contemporary contraction in bank lending and the progressive reduction of the monetary policy securities portfolio of the Eurosystem. Two liability-side factors reinforced the contraction in the availability of cheap funding: first, banks substituting TLTRO funding for long-term bonds; and second, a strong portfolio rebalancing by households and firms on the liability side of bank balance sheets.
In particular, the increased remuneration of time deposits and bonds after a long period of low or negative interest rates has incentivised shifts to these instruments from overnight deposits and other low-remuneration deposits. During the period of low interest rates, the opportunity cost of holding overnight deposits was very low, causing households and firms to prefer overnight deposits. The monetary policy tightening and its transmission to deposit rates and yields on other financial assets, has increased the opportunity cost of holding overnight deposits to levels similar to those seen in previous hiking cycles. This has led households and firms to move a significant portion of their unusually large stock of overnight deposits to time deposits and bonds (Chart 13).[38]
The high level of liquidity within the banking system has not impeded the transmission of our monetary policy tightening to households and businesses. Although in the cross-section banks with greater excess liquidity at the onset of the tightening cycle have reduced their lending to a lesser extent than their less liquid peers, the overall transmission of monetary policy has been robust and, if anything, been stronger than in previous cycles.
The apparent differences between the cross-sectional and time series results can be reconciled as follows. From a theoretical standpoint, excess reserves on the balance sheets of banks exert dual effects during a period of monetary tightening. On one side, the initiation of an unexpected tightening phase allows banks with excess reserves to benefit from higher returns on these reserves. This helps bolster their profits, potentially augments their capital buffers, relaxes constraints and ultimately expands the supply of lending. This wealth effect is in line with the results of the cross-sectional analysis.[39]At the same time, as the remuneration of reserves increases, these reserves become increasingly attractive to banks, as these represent a highly remunerated, secure and liquid asset. As a result, banks may be reluctant to extend their lending or to invest in bonds unless the price of these financial instruments is sufficiently attractive. This substitution effect may well have been the prevailing force in the aggregate transmission of our monetary policy.[40]That is to say, while the wealth effect may explain the cross-sectional variation in lending behaviour among banks with differing levels of excess liquidity, the substitution effect likely contributed to the strong transmission of monetary tightening on an aggregate level.
As the quantity-theory expression MV=PY makes clear, the connection between outside money – the currency and reserves supplied by the central bank – and prices is mediated by adjustments in velocity. Velocity is a complex function of a host of factors, some of which pertain to the decisions by banks to intermediate credit, others having to do with the decisions by different types of money holders on the financial instruments in which they want to keep their wealth. All else equal, credit creation pushes up velocity and thereby, for a given level of real income, generates price pressures. Conversely, portfolio reallocations towards larger money holdings serves to reduce velocity and weaken inflation for a given stock of outside money.
In a nutshell, these two factors have been offsetting each other in recent years. When loans were rapidly expanding in the early phase of the pandemic crisis, a sharp rise in liquidity preference – and the short-term bridging nature of the loans themselves – attenuated the inflationary potential of money growth. When eventually portfolios started shedding excess liquidity – a potential source of inflation – loans began to decline in parallel, providing a cushion against money-generated inflationary pressures.
Future challenges
Looking ahead, a prominent challenge for monetary analysis is to understand how the normalisation of the balance sheets of central banks may affect transmission in the years to come.
Measures that expand the central bank balance sheet stimulate bank lending and risk-taking through three main channels.[41]First, the decrease in long-term interest rates associated with the purchases of long-term securities by the central bank lowers borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, ultimately stimulating their loan demand. Second, investors (including banks and other financial institutions) that sell assets to the central bank try to rebalance their portfolio towards higher-yielding investments, which can also lead to increased lending supply.[42]Third, the liquidity injected into the banking system via central bank purchases of financial assets can enhance the capacity of banks to lend because that type of liquidity, perceived to remain in the system for a long time, may be seen as providing a permanent means to service the mobile type of deposits that are the by-product of an extension of bank credit.
In studying this critical nexus with the help of monetary analysis, it is worth recalling the notion of the “money multiplier”. Based on this mechanism, in a fractional reserve banking system a policy-induced expansion of the free reserves of cash held by the banks spurs, through successive rounds of loan and deposit creation, increasing volumes of credit and inside money. Outright central bank asset purchases increase bank reserve holdings and prompt banks to try to minimise the associated liquidity surplus – which is costly – by creating credit and other claims on those surplus reserves in an effort to enhance shareholder returns. This mechanism helps explain the strong connection of credit with reserve creation in times of QE, even when controlling for demand-for-credit effects as lending rates decline as a result of QE. In the other direction, a withdrawal of reserves sets in motion a cumulative process by which credit and deposits shrink by a multiple of the original negative shock to the reserve holdings.[43]It follows that, in order to assess the implications of QT, it is important to trace all the implications of the central bank balance sheet contraction for asset prices and credit in an encompassing framework and to take into account the relation between central bank liquidity and bank intermediation capacity.[44]
The relevance of the money multiplier is also supported by recent empirical analysis using comprehensive bank-level and loan-level data on lending from euro area banks to firms. A recent ECB study draws two main conclusions. First, the availability of central bank liquidity significantly influences banks' credit provision, in what the authors call a “reserve availability channel” of monetary policy. Second, the source of central bank reserves affects their impact on bank intermediation: non-borrowed reserves – those created as a result of a securities purchase programme – have very strong empirical connection with bank loans, whereas this is not the case for borrowed reserves drawn by banks from a short-term refinancing facility (Chart 14).[45]
These mechanisms are in line with a growing body of empirical studies focusing on the relation between central bank reserves and bank lending. Examples include analyses that show that: (a) banks that increased their reserve holdings, following the third round of quantitative easing announced by the Federal Reserve, increased lending; (b) banks with higher excess reserve holdings grant more credit lines and take more risk; (c) the reallocation of central bank reserves towards banks with higher liquidity needs fosters credit supply; and (d) the credit supply of reserve-rich banks is less sensitive to monetary policy tightening than that of other banks.[46]
Conclusions
As I have covered in this lecture, modern monetary analysis is helping policymakers to analyse the nexus of money, credit and the economy. Moreover, the frontier in modern monetary analysis is continuing to expand: the enhanced availability of granular data, filtered through an expanding computation capacity and new machine learning techniques, is further broadening its scope and the relevance of its findings for the calibration of monetary policy. For these reasons, monetary analysis plays a central role at the ECB, with a data-dependent approach to assessing the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission a key element in our reaction function."

Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Joint Conference of the European Commission and the ECB on European Financial Integration
Frankfurt am Main, 18 June 2024
It is a pleasure to address you once again at this annual joint conference on European financial integration. Over the years, this platform has become an important forum for discussing the pivotal issues shaping the financial landscape of the EU.
The discussions and analysis we heard in today’s sessions provide valuable perspectives on how we can foster financial integration. The conference is also very timely, coming just before a new European Commission will have to shape the policy agenda for the coming years. Financial integration and financial stability are key to ensuring a resilient and prosperous future for Europe.
Developments in financial integration
Despite the resilience shown during the recent unprecedented times – marked by significant global geopolitical and economic shocks – progress towards greater financial integration in the euro area has been disappointing overall.
Over the past two years, price and quantity-based measures of financial integration have declined substantially. In fact, we are back to the levels seen at the start of the monetary union, and this is despite the significant legislative efforts made over the past decade. Cross-border financial market activities and risk sharing have not recorded any growth.
Financial integration has shown little progress in terms of cross-border bank lending and equity markets. Yet these markets are key to helping small and medium-sized enterprises – the backbone of the euro area economy – overcome their financing challenges. They are also a critical source of risk capital for innovative and high-growth companies, particularly in sectors such as technology, biotech and renewable energy.
Facilitating cross-border banking and removing barriers to cross-border crisis management
Cross-border lending can generate important benefits, especially in relation to private sector risk sharing across countries. Banks can reduce the concentration and home bias of their exposures while borrowers can broaden their access to financing and strengthen funding resilience when the domestic market is under stress.
Yet, the European banking sector is still fragmented. Over the past decade, little progress has been made in integrating banking groups across borders. And when consolidation in the banking sector does occur, it is often at the national level.
Despite the existence of a European supervisory and resolution framework, a number of prudential and resolution requirements, such as capital, liquidity and loss-absorbing requirements, are still national in nature. This is a major obstacle to integration.
To foster cross-border banking, we should make it easier for banks to operate as truly integrated groups within the banking union. For this to happen, there needs to be the same possibilities for pooling capital and liquidity across legal entities located in different Member States as there are for banking groups operating within a single Member State. We should also take a more harmonised approach, and a banking union perspective, when setting minimum standards for capital buffers.
In times of crisis, further harmonising bank crisis management across the banking union will enhance the level playing field in Europe. Stakeholders need to be sure that, if a bank fails, there will be a similar outcome regardless of where in Europe the bank is domiciled. The resolution framework is a key part of this effort. And the ongoing reform of the crisis management and deposit insurance framework aims to broaden the application of the harmonised resolution framework beyond significant banks.
Yet many bank failures will still be managed under national insolvency regimes, so further convergence on these is also needed.
When a bank is wound up under a national insolvency framework, the deposit guarantee scheme plays a vital role in safeguarding depositors’ access to their accounts. For now, these deposit guarantee schemes are also national, which can lead to the perception that a euro deposited in one Member State is safer than in another.
Finally making progress on introducing a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) should be a priority for the next legislative term. The recent progress on this dossier in the European Parliament makes me hopeful we can achieve a breakthrough. EDIS would bring us closer to the vision of a true single market for banking in Europe.
A single market for capital in the EU
For the ECB’s Governing Council, a more integrated EU banking market is a key reason to develop a capital markets union (CMU) and establish a single market for capital in the EU.[1]
Previous editions of the reports presented today have illustrated the need to further integrate financial markets to enhance the euro area economy’s resilience through private risk sharing and to strengthen the international role of our common currency.
It has become increasingly clear that European capital markets are instrumental in the pursuit, and financing, of the EU’s strategic goals. We need massive investment to drive the green and digital transitions and we must boost the EU’s productivity and competitiveness.
A starting point for this discussion is often the relative success of US capital markets, which can be attributed to several factors. A significant one is the global role of the dollar in international finance. A common set of laws and regulations on trading financial assets ensures the coherence of US capital markets. This is supported by the market for US treasuries, the largest and most liquid asset in the world. And a consolidated trading and post-trading landscape also encourages investor participation in the market. These elements contribute to the pivotal role that US capital markets play in financing innovative firms domestically and internationally.
Drawing on this, initiatives to promote pan-EU capital markets should first focus on enhancing both the supply of and demand for capital market funding. I see several concrete action points.
The first is to channel Europe’s savings towards EU equity and bond markets by developing EU-wide savings products subject to a common framework and harmonised tax incentives.
Second, we need to develop equity markets to make them more attractive for issuers and investors. Risk capital markets are particularly important for fostering the innovation necessary for the green and digital transition.
Third, we must mobilise securitisation markets for CMU. Comparing EU and US markets highlights the role that US government-sponsored enterprises play in fostering standardisation and market depth in the US. Pan-EU issuance – possibly enhanced by a public guarantee – could broaden the investor base and support segments such as green securitisation.
We must remember that simply increasing finance is not enough to achieve economic growth. Funding needs to be used in the most effective way possible. This is why we also need policies that support economic restructuring and projects that provide opportunities for more productive funding.
Finally, the push for CMU – or a savings and investment union – should go hand in hand with renewed efforts to remove barriers within the Single Market. Further harmonisation of corporate insolvency rules, accounting frameworks and securities law is needed to establish a single capital market with scale and depth.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Financial integration has supported the euro area’s resilience in the face of significant geopolitical risks, economic shocks and unprecedented high levels of inflation. This is reassuring. However, the decline in certain measures and the sluggish progress towards greater integration is disappointing. Urgent action is therefore needed to increase investment in the EU and establish clear priorities to address the challenges ahead.
Advancing CMU should be a critical political project for the new European Commission. It should go hand in hand with strengthening the resilience of the non-bank financial sector as it consolidates its importance in financing the EU’s real economy.
At the same time, Europe remains primarily bank-based. And completing the banking union remains a priority. A single capital market needs to come in addition to, and not instead of, a complete banking union. Setting up EDIS should be high on the agenda in the next EU legislative term. It is essential for depositor confidence and for ensuring a level playing field for banks.
Both the capital markets union and the banking union should be viewed within the broader context of the European project. Enrico Letta’s recent report[2]rightly considers the Single Market as central to financing strategic goals, competitiveness and the future of the EU. Removing existing barriers within the market for goods and services and advancing in the three strategic sectors that were previously excluded from the Single Market – namely financial services, energy, and telecommunications – will allow us to benefit from the full scale of the market. The single market for goods and services is essential to attract investment, make our Economic and Monetary Union more resilient and support the EU’s role as global player on the international stage. At the same time, State aid procedures must guarantee a level playing field and be compatible with the single market.
Lastly, a permanent EU central fiscal capacity remains essential to the European project. It would enable us to tackle geopolitical and economic challenges more effectively. And by supporting investment in strategically important areas, generating economies of scale and raising productivity across the bloc, it would help to improve the welfare of European citizens while further enhancing financial integration in the EU."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the 30th Dubrovnik Economic Conference
Dubrovnik, 14 June 2024
It is a pleasure to be here in Dubrovnik.
To this day, the stunning beauty of this city evokes the words of one of its most famous poets, Ivan Gundulić: “O lijepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo”.[1]
These words may be centuries old, but they remain as fresh as ever for those who have the good fortune to experience Dubrovnik first-hand.
The programme for the 30th Dubrovnik Economic Conference offers a snapshot of policymaking in a world of transition. And this world of transition is, increasingly, a world of profound uncertainty for economic policymakers.
If you look back at the speeches of former central bankers – as I’m sure many of you enjoy doing – policymakers in every era claim that the world has never been more uncertain.
And indeed the world is not necessarily more tumultuous than in the past, but the nature of the risks we are facing is unusual.
Increasingly, volatility in growth and inflation will not only be driven by the business cycle, which we understand relatively well, or even by the financial cycle, which we understand less well but can at least try to pre-empt.
It will also be driven by a pair of major structural forces that we have next to no experience of: geopolitical fragmentation and climate change.
The fragmenting of a previously highly globalised world is a type of risk that advanced economies have not faced since the period after the First World War. And a rapidly changing climate is a risk that we have not seen for millennia.
The unusual risk environment
Three factors make these risks special for policymakers.
First, they are particularly difficult to quantify and forecast.
We saw this in Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but more generally geopolitical risks create various types of spillovers that are hard to map out ex ante.
That said, there are some recent studies that try to quantify the impact of conflicts. One study, for example, estimates that for countries that are geographically close to a war zone, output falls by more than 10% over five years and inflation rises by 5 percentage points on average.[2]Another finds that firms with greater exposure to geopolitical risk experience an increased probability of default, lower market valuations and higher financing costs.[3]
Climate change is similarly hard to forecast, as is visible for example in the struggles the insurance industry is facing to accurately price climate risks.
An increasing frequency of extreme weather events means that claims costs no longer correspond to the historical data used to price risk. Last year set a record for the highest number of insured natural catastrophes yet.[4]
And climate change increases uncertainty about inflation, too: ECB research finds that extreme summer heat could ultimately push up food inflation in the euro area by between one and two percentage points.[5]
The second factor that makes these risks special is that they reinforce each other.
A weakening multilateral order not only makes it more difficult to agree on collective climate action, but it also increasingly threatens to disrupt the flow of clean technology that is necessary to lower the cost and accelerate the speed of the green transition globally.
With China now becoming the dominant supplier of solar panels, battery cells and electric vehicles, we are seeing an increasing trade-off between faster decarbonisation and greater economic security as countries seek to reduce their dependencies.
In turn, unmitigated climate change could strengthen fragmentary forces. For instance, an uneven distribution of extreme weather events may induce disorderly migration flows, straining international relations and encouraging policymakers to establish more barriers.
One recent paper estimates that a changing climate could impel significant numbers of working-age people to migrate over the course of this century.[6]
The third factor is that both risks are characterised by potential “tipping points” – that is, non-linearities – beyond which it would be very difficult to turn back.
If the multilateral order were to break down, history suggests that the opportunity to rebuild it again may be a long time coming. Indeed, every major overhaul of the international order, be it the Congress of Vienna in the nineteenth century or the Bretton Woods Conference in the twentieth, was typically preceded and enabled by a major war.
And were global heating to reach a certain level, we may see irreversible transformations. For example, as warmer weather causes permafrost in polar regions to thaw, stored methane is released into the atmosphere. This causes further heating, and a self-reinforcing feedback loop emerges.
Policymaking in an uncertain world
So what can we do to make our policies robust in this environment?
Certainly, the best-case scenario would be for countries to “carve out” areas that will be spared from geopolitical rivalry, such as working together towards net zero, and to find ways to increase mutual economic security without fragmenting world trade.
But if we are realistic, we must admit that with each passing day this scenario looks less likely. The World Bank finds that almost 3,000 trade restrictions were imposed last year – five times the amount in 2015.[7]And 2023 was the hottest year on record.[8]
So policymakers need to be prepared for a “second-best” scenario in which these risks do start to reinforce each other and tipping points draw closer. This scenario is likely to create two tensions for central banks that we will need to address.
The first tension is between what we can observe and what we can project.
The last few years have shown that making policy based on projections alone is likely to be misleading. For instance, there were certain periods when recent inflation was the most informative signal about future inflation, and so the best policy was to overweigh recent data relative to a necessarily uncertain forecast.
But as major shocks passed we saw forecasts becoming more accurate. In 2023, for example, we saw a reduction of about 70% in the average absolute error in our staff projections relative to 2022, one quarter ahead. Relying too much on current data in this setting would have been equally misguided and led to policy falling behind the curve.
The challenge for policymakers is that it is not always easy to know in real-time which regime you are in, especially around turning points. And we cannot be changing our mind from one day to the next on what kinds of data are most important to us.
For inflation expectations to remain anchored in an environment of structural changes and less quantifiable shocks, people need to be able to broadly predict our reaction function and know what developments we will tolerate and what we will not.
That is why I have argued that, in the future, we will need to have ex ante policy frameworks that combine both forward-looking and current-looking elements.
We need forecasts of the medium term, but we also need to be alert to the fact that available models have been “educated” using data from previous structural regimes that may no longer be valid. So, analysing current data and identifying persistent components allows us to account for structural changes and forecast the future in a more robust way.
This is essentially the approach the ECB has been using since March last year, when we deployed a three-sided reaction function to make our decisions more robust: a forward-looking component – our inflation projections – and two more current-looking ones, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
We have also made more use of scenario analysis to help us understand the risks around our projections if certain assumptions turn out differently.
This framework served us well in calibrating when to stop raising rates, how long to hold them constant and, most recently, when to start cutting them. And for the time being, we will continue to use it to set the rate path in an uncertain environment.
The second tension is between independence and interdependence.
Central banks make decisions independently, but those decisions are interdependent with the actions of other authorities. When policies are well aligned, that interdependence can lead to virtuous circles which help all authorities deliver on their objectives.
For example, increasing government investment to reduce energy supply constraints may make medium-term inflation lower and less volatile. That would, in turn, warrant lower policy rates over time, encouraging more investment, and so on.
But faced with “existential” risks like geopolitical conflict and climate change, it is natural for people to ask whether central banks can contribute more explicitly.
In my view, the answer to this question has two parts.
First, the evidence we have so far suggests that the new types of shocks we are facing are likely to put upward pressure on prices, at least initially.
One recent study based on data since 1900 finds that geopolitical risks lead to high inflation, lower economic activity and a fall in international trade.[9]And climate change is likely to initially appear as a negative supply shock – although over time investment in renewables, grids and storage will lead to lower and more stable energy prices.
In this setting, it is important that we continue to focus on inflation and stabilise inflation expectations at our target. We know that the public detests high inflation, and allowing it to become embedded in the economy would disrupt our politics and undermine all other geopolitical and climate goals.
However – and this is my second point – as a changing climate and geopolitical fragmentation have implications for our mandate, there is scope for action within our mandate. Let me give you a few examples.
The ECB now measures and monitors climate-related risks, and we have incorporated climate change considerations into our collateral framework.
Currency swap lines are vital instruments in helping to reduce volatility, but they too have a geopolitical impact as they can strengthen the dynamics of major international currencies.[10]
And given the dominance of non-European digital payment firms, the launch of a digital euro would protect the strategic autonomy of European payments and monetary sovereignty, providing a fall-back solution if geopolitical tensions intensify.[11]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Policymakers today are grappling with new kinds of risks. While the best-case scenario would be for policymakers to work together to prevent these risks from materialising, we need to be prepared for a “second-best” world.
That will be a world marked by higher levels of uncertainty and volatility, and it will create tensions for central banks that we will have to resolve.
But at the same time, I am reminded of the words of the Croatian poet Antun Branko Šimić: “Man, be careful not to walk small under the stars.” Policymakers are not prisoners of fate, and there is scope for action.
We can find balanced ways to move forwards – ways that account for the new environment, but that also allow us to continue delivering on our mandate."

Dinner speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the 2024 Annual ECB Banking Supervision Research Conference
Frankfurt am Main, 11 June 2024
Like many events this year, the Annual ECB Banking Supervision Research Conference is celebrating the tenth anniversary of European banking supervision under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Ten years of the SSM also means ten years of monetary policy and banking supervision living under the same roof. It means ten years of ECB Banking Supervision existing alongside the ECB’s central banking arm and benefiting from the same shared services that are critical for effective monetary policy and banking supervision. And one could also say ten years of close family ties between the experts working in monetary policy and banking supervision, both here in Frankfurt and across Europe in the European System of Central Banks and the Single Supervisory Mechanism.
And like all families, ours is unique.
One distinctive institutional feature of European banking supervision is the separation principle that applies between the ECB’s monetary policy and supervisory tasks. The former targets price stability and the latter strives to keep banks safe and sound. Under this set-up, the ECB has a Governing Council, which takes monetary policy decisions, and a separate and independent Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board proposes draft supervisory decisions to the ECB’s Governing Council, which can adopt or reject these decisions, but not modify them. The separation principle ensures that each function is carried out in accordance with its specific objectives and prevents potential conflicts of interest.
The Governing Council is chaired by Christine Lagarde and the Supervisory Board by Claudia Buch. In addition, the Supervisory Board has a Vice-Chair who is chosen from among the members of the ECB’s Executive Board. I currently hold this role. And this comes with the great privilege of being the one person who participates in all the key decision-making bodies of our unique ECB family, for both monetary policy and banking supervision.
In my remarks this evening, I will explain how our decade-old ECB family is about more than just sharing an institution, a roof and a Vice-Chair. Though pursuing different objectives, our monetary policy and banking supervision functions have several of the same characteristics: their focus on stability, a commitment to their respective mandates, their attitude towards risks, and the challenges they will face in the years and decades to come.
Our common ties can be traced back to the origins of European banking supervision.
The SSM was born out of crisis. In the years leading up to the establishment of European banking supervision, the euro area economy was struggling to recover from the great financial crisis and the euro area debt crisis. Financial crises and financial fragilities led to de-risking and deleveraging, which had negative repercussions on economic growth and the inflation outlook. Back then, weaknesses in the banking sector hindered the transmission of our accommodative monetary policy into similarly favourable financing conditions for companies and citizens. These obstructions to the transmission mechanism made it much more difficult for the ECB to maintain price stability.
Ultimately, the persistent weaknesses in the European banking sector led governments to establish the banking union. In addition to European banking supervision through the SSM, with a central role for the ECB, the banking union would include a Single Resolution Mechanism and a European deposit insurance scheme, although this third pillar is yet to be implemented. One of European banking supervision’s achievements has been the strong culture of cooperation within our pan-European joint supervisory teams, who use a harmonised supervisory methodology that ensures the same standards are applied across all supervised banks. This has helped to significantly reduce risks in the European banking sector and increase the resilience of European banks.
The efforts of European banking supervision have paid off. This became clear during the pandemic, which was the first major crisis since the creation of the banking union. Instead of being sources or amplifiers of shocks like in previous crises, banks proved to be resilient to the pandemic shock. In fact, they were able to help dampen it by extending credit to citizens and companies that had experienced a sudden loss of income. Unlike during the crises that predated the banking union, banks were no longer part of to the problem, but part of the solution. Of course, it should be kept in mind that they were able to do so in a context of massive fiscal support to citizens and companies and accommodative monetary policy.
So where do we stand now? Let me start with the positives, but I must stress that these are no reason to be complacent.
On the banking supervision side, we see that European banks still have robust fundamentals, including sound capital positions and liquidity buffers. Levels of non-performing loans are relatively low, although they have started to increase recently. Thanks to their generally sound starting position, banks have been able to smoothly navigate the adverse macro-financial conditions seen since the end of the pandemic, such as increasing interest rates, geopolitical shocks and the banking sector turmoil in March 2023.
Meanwhile, on the monetary policy side, we have explicitly recognised the importance of safe and sound banks for our price stability mandate since July 2021, when we concluded our strategy review. Specifically, we acknowledge that financial stability is a precondition for price stability. Moreover, monitoring the transmission mechanism of monetary policy – including how banks pass on our policy decisions – is a key consideration when calibrating our monetary policy. We made this very clear in our communication since we started to tighten monetary policy. In addition to the inflation outlook and the dynamics of underlying inflation, assessing the strength of monetary policy transmission is a key element of our reaction function. The safety and soundness of banks has not only made them resilient to the unprecedented increase in policy rates, which went from -0.5% in July 2022 to 4.0% in September 2023. It has also enabled them to pass on our policy rate increases in an effective and orderly fashion, ensuring that broader financing conditions evolved in line with our monetary policy intentions. Having said that, pass-through would have even been stronger had there been tougher competition for deposits in Member States.
From last September up to last week, a period when we kept policy rates on hold, we saw a continued strong and effective transmission of monetary policy. By keeping broader financing conditions restrictive, monetary policy has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down from high levels. That is why, at last week’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council, we considered it appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction by lowering our key interest rates by 25 basis points.
Banks have proven resilient, and inflation is continuing its downward trend. You might therefore expect both sides of the ECB family to be generally content with the progress made in the pursuit of their objectives in the recent tumultuous years. But we are also a family that doesn’t easily declare victory, is always on the alert, and we warn of complacency in view of looming risks and lingering fragilities that may affect price stability and the safety and soundness of banks in the future. This is ingrained in our family DNA for all our tasks and responsibilities.
Such caution is particularly called for in today’s macro-financial environment, which has been very much in flux in recent years amid changes in the economic outlook, geopolitical shocks, and challenges related to global heating, nature degradation and digitalisation. We expect this period of elevated uncertainty to continue, bringing challenges for both banking supervision and monetary policy. Indeed, the risks and trends identified in our monetary policy strategy and our supervisory priorities for the years ahead are very similar.
So what will these challenges in the macro-financial environment imply for our tasks?
First, our objectives will become even more important. Price stability and sound banks provide an anchor that makes an economy – and therefore a society – more resilient to shocks. The more frequent and intensive the shocks, the more vital a secure anchor. For it is in choppy, not calm, waters when a ship truly benefits from its anchor.
At the same time, the types of shock hitting the economy and the financial system will become more complex to assess. But an accurate assessment is crucial to gauging the potential risk to price stability or to the soundness of banks, as well as the appropriate policy response.
Take the example of the ongoing and worsening climate and nature crises. We know that manifestations of physical risk – like floods, fires, droughts and extreme weather events – are on the rise. Governments are acting to support the green transition, while pursuing climate adaptation measures is becoming ever more important. A relevant question is whether climate and nature shocks can be fully captured by the traditional categorisation of demand, supply and financial shocks used in most macroeconomic models. In that vein, my fellow ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel has suggested thinking about the impact of climate change on inflation in terms of “climateflation”, “fossilflation” and “greenflation”.[1]Even if such concepts can be mapped analytically into the more traditional type of shocks, we need to learn more about the exact mechanisms before being able to draw the appropriate conclusions for monetary policy.
Something similar applies on the banking supervision side. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has established that climate-related risks translate into the traditional types of risk that banks consider[2], covering credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk, including litigation risk.[3]However, here too, the exact mechanisms of mapping actual hazards to risks needs to be analysed further to fully capture climate and nature-related factors in quantifiable regulatory and supervisory requirements.
These are vitally important questions as global heating, nature degradation and transition and adaptation policies have a profound impact on the economy and the financial system. As Supervisory Board Chair Claudia Buch underlined in her opening address, research has an important role to play in supporting monetary policy and supervision in respect of these and other major challenges like the impact of geopolitical risks and the digital transition.[4]
Some of these themes will feature at this conference tomorrow. And on the monetary policy side, we recently established a new research network known as Challenges for Monetary Policy Transmission in a Changing World (ChaMP). The ChaMP network seeks to revisit our knowledge of monetary transmission channels in the context of unprecedented shocks and structural changes.[5]Through conferences such as this one, initiatives like the ChaMP network, and many other interactions with the research community, we seek your inspiration, ideas and insights to address the challenges facing monetary policy and banking supervision in the future.
Let me wrap up.
Ten years ago, we at the ECB saw our family grow with the establishment of the SSM.
Ten years on, European banking supervision has made great strides in making banks more robust and resilient. This has helped strengthen the European economy in general while also enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.
In the next ten years, the two strands of our family will continue to pursue their respective objectives, no matter what challenges may emerge. They will do so under one roof, in line with the separation principle and united in their commitment.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Banking & Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) National Banking Conference
Dublin, 11 June 2024
Let me begin by offering some comments on the economic outlook, before discussing our decision last week to cut the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.[1]The latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresee economic growth at 0.9 per cent in 2024, 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.6 per cent in 2026, while inflation is projected to average 2.5 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in 2026. Relative to the average annual inflation rates in 2022 and 2023 of 8.4 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively, considerable disinflation has already occurred, with the latest inflation figure at 2.6% in May. For inflation excluding energy and food (often termed core inflation), staff project an average of 2.8 per cent in 2024, 2.2 per cent in 2025 and 2.0 per cent in 2026. Since core inflation stood at 3.9 per cent and 4.9 per cent in 2022 and 2023 respectively, the outlook for 2024-2026 also indicates considerable core disinflation is in train. The current task for monetary policy is to ensure that full disinflation is secured, with inflation returning to our two per cent target in a timely manner and settling at this level on a sustainable basis.
Rather than provide a full analysis of all the factors that determine inflation dynamics, let me briefly discuss wage dynamics, which play an especially important role in the final stages of the disinflation process.[2]Wage growth is still elevated, primarily driven by the ongoing adjustment to the past inflation surge. The growth rate of compensation per employee ticked up from 4.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 5.0 per cent in the first quarter, largely reflecting an increase in negotiated wage growth from 4.5 per cent to 4.7 per cent. This stronger growth in the first quarter includes very large one-off payments in the German public sector.[3]More broadly, the design of some multi-year wage settlements specify large increases in 2024 (to compensate for the lack of earlier pay adjustments to the inflation surge) but much smaller increases in 2025. The set of forward-looking wage trackers also signal that wage dynamics will remain elevated in 2024 but will decelerate in 2025. The Indeed wage tracker declined to 3.4 per cent in April; similarly, firms participating in the Corporate Telephone Survey expect wages to rise at a rate of 4.3 per cent in 2024, compared to 5.4 per cent in 2023.
This negatively-sloped profile for wage growth helps to underpin the projected decline in inflation in 2025, with less pressure from labour costs next year. Over time, disinflation will also continue to be supported by the restrictive monetary policy stance and the fading impact of past inflation on ongoing price pressures, while the countervailing impact from the reversal of fiscal support measures will fall out of the inflation data.
While wage growth is set to be a primary driver of inflation in 2024, the net impact of labour cost increases on prices is being buffered by a lower contribution from profits. In particular, by dampening demand and containing inflation expectations, our restrictive monetary stance is constraining the ability of firms to pass through cost increases to consumer prices. This is evident in the data for the first quarter, which show unit profit growth turning negative. In turn, this contributed to the decline in the “GDP deflator” inflation rate (which reflects the prices of goods and services produced in the euro area economy, net of the value of intermediate inputs) from 5.1 per cent in Q4 2023 to 3.6 per cent in Q1 2024. The ongoing compression of unit profits will play an important role in keeping the disinflation process on track, even while the final stages of catch-up dynamics mean that wage growth remains elevated this year.
Let me now turn to last week’s monetary policy decision. After nine months of holding the deposit facility rate (the primary policy rate that steers money market conditions) at 4.0 per cent, we cut it to 3.75 per cent.[4]Over the interval since our September 2023 monetary policy meeting, the projected timely return of inflation to our target has been reconfirmed in the December, March and June projection rounds.[5]For instance, over the last four forecast rounds, the projected fourth quarter-on-fourth quarter HICP inflation rate for 2025 has oscillated within the very narrow interval of 1.9 per cent to 2.0 per cent. As 2025 draws closer, the timeliness of the projected return to target looms larger on the horizon. In addition, in terms of the sustainability of maintaining inflation at the target, the inflation outlook for 2026 has been reconfirmed over the last three projection rounds.
Moreover, the overall speed of disinflation has been faster than expected. Over this period, inflation has come down by 2.6 percentage points. While at the start of the holding phase, staff saw inflation averaging 5.6 per cent in 2023 and 3.2 per cent in 2024, inflation turned out to average 5.4 per cent in 2023 and, for 2024, it is expected at 2.5 per cent in the latest projection exercise (0.7 percentage points lower than projected last September). The set of underlying inflation indicators also shows considerable progress compared to the start of the holding period, with most gauges drifting lower towards two per cent.
This improvement in the inflation profile has reduced the risk to the stability of inflation expectations posed by “too high for too long” inflation, including through its impact on future price and wage resets. Compared to last September, measures of shorter-term inflation expectations have declined, while measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable, with most standing at around two per cent.
In parallel, the evidence indicates that our monetary stance has been clearly restrictive. Mortgage rates are measurably lower compared to their autumn peak but indices of affordability of mortgage credit still point to restrictive conditions. In particular, compared to the start of the holding period, real lending rates to firms and households have risen markedly and are expected to remain significantly higher than assumed in the September 2023 projections, suppressing demand for external finance. Activity is recovering, although not sufficiently in those segments of demand that are most sensitive to interest rates, such as construction – beyond the temporary factors supporting construction activity in Germany and Italy – and business investment. In addition, consumer confidence, while gradually recovering, remains subdued. Overall, the incoming data on financing conditions signal that the monetary stance remains restrictive, which will help maintain the disinflation process.
An interest rate decision should be robust across a wide range of scenarios. The baseline projections reflect the market yield curve, which envisages a set of rate cuts in 2024 and 2025. However, at a still clearly restrictive level of 3.75 per cent for the deposit facility rate, the realisation of even a substantial margin of upside shocks to inflation could be addressed by a slower pace of rate reductions compared to the baseline rate path embedded in the projections.[6]At the same time, a policy rate level of 3.75 per cent also offers more protection against downside shocks compared to remaining at 4.0 per cent.
It should be clear that the high level of uncertainty and the still-elevated price pressures that are evident in the indicators for domestic inflation, services inflation and wage growth mean that we will need to maintain a restrictive monetary stance, following a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. Over time, the incoming data should be informative about the balance between backward-looking price level adjustment dynamics (that should gradually die out) and the more problematic and persistent underlying component in inflation. In connecting the inflation data and the broader economic and financial data, the evolution of cost dynamics and domestic pricing power will depend on the strength and composition of the cyclical recovery.[7]
That is to say, our data-dependent approach requires us to carefully analyse and interpret the incoming information in the context of our three-part evaluation framework in order to assess the implications for the inflation outlook (both in terms of the baseline and risk scenarios), the dynamics of underlying inflation and the state of monetary policy transmission.
We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner, and we will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path and will continue to take a meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Maurice Allais Foundation
Paris, 7 June 2024
It is an honour to be speaking to you today as part of your series of workshops in memory of Maurice Allais.
His contributions, in particular his work on general equilibrium theory and market efficiency, helped lay the theoretical foundations for the growth model that Western economies pursued after the Second World War.
As Maurice Allais once said, “what could be a better way of preparing for the aftermath of the war than to try to find a solution to the fundamental problem of any economy, namely how to promote the greatest feasible economic efficiency”.[1]
In many ways, his vision was borne out. Prioritising efficiency, both in our internal economic affairs, such as developing the single European market, and in our external trade, led to a period of unprecedented sustained economic growth.
And as economies advanced along a path of steadily increasing potential output, central banks like the ECB could focus first and foremost on stabilising inflation by managing demand, without having to worry too much about structural changes in the economy.
But Maurice Allais also predicted that widespread global integration without proper governance could “only create instability everywhere”.[2]And this prediction is now, regrettably, also proving to be correct.
Open trade has led to increasing tensions between major powers – although notably not within the EU, where we have had a suitable governance system in place. And as a result, multilateral trade is becoming more fragmented: the number of new global trade restrictions has been rising steadily, from about 650 new restrictions in 2017 to more than 3,000 in 2023.[3]
At the same time, the environmental costs of rapid global economic integration – coupled with the undervaluation of ecosystem services – are now having to be paid.
The supply of the nature-related services that underpin global growth, such as timber, minerals and carbon storage, is diminishing. Six of the nine “planetary boundaries” – Earth system processes, including climate change and biodiversity, which maintain the planet’s stability – have been breached.[4]
These developments reinforce each other, as increasing animosity reduces the political will to work together on climate issues. And rising trade barriers impede the flow of renewable technologies that are crucial to preventing further climate degradation.
As central bankers, we are now facing a fundamentally different environment: one characterised by more instability, more volatility and more uncertainty about the very structure of the economy.
I have argued previously that this new world requires us to rethink our policy frameworks.[5]Today, I would like to explain why, as we develop strategies to manage this environment, we need to pay particular attention to climate and nature-related risks owing to the unique impacts they have. And I will also explain how the ECB is responding to them.
The unique nature of climate and nature-related risks
The world never stands still, and central banks are constantly facing new shocks, new risks and changes in the economic environment – be it reversals in government policy, tensions in the financial sector or disruptions in global trade. In most cases, we simply have to take the environment as given and adjust our policy accordingly.
But there are four factors which make climate and nature-related risks a unique challenge for central banks – a challenge that calls for a different type of response.
First, they are a new type of systemic risk. Unlike rare tail events known as “black swans”, climate change represents a break from the classical Gaussian probabilistic universe because it is doomed to happen if not addressed by appropriate policies.
These risks also extend globally. If we fail to stop the rise in average temperatures, extreme climate events will become inevitable. Among 380 climate scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 77% believe humanity is headed for at least 2.5°C of global heating, well beyond the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5°C.[6]
The second factor is the irreversibility of their impacts. If we do not reverse the course of climate change and environmental degradation, we will reach points of no return.
Some ecosystems are subject to tipping points which, if reached, may change the climate so much that it is impossible – or extremely difficult and costly – to return the environment to its original state.
For example, the Amazon rainforest and tropical peatlands currently store around 220 gigatonnes of carbon, equivalent to 20 years of global CO2emissions.[7]If these were destabilised, it would become virtually impossible to stay below 1.5°C of global heating.
Third, the impacts of climate and nature-related risks will spread throughout the economy, affecting central banks’ tasks.
The recent energy crisis, although unrelated to the green transition, illustrates how volatile energy prices and shifts in energy markets can significantly influence inflation dynamics.The increase in prices of energy and energy-sensitive goods and services contributed around 6 percentage points to euro area inflation at its peak in October 2022.
Furthermore, climate and nature-related risks create financial risks on the balance sheets of financial institutions. These risks can lead to losses or higher funding costs, reducing the flow of credit to the real economy. This can also affect the transmission of central bank policies to the financing conditions of households and firms.[8]
In the euro area, banks are exposed to climate-related risks, with high-emitting sectors over-represented in their corporate loan portfolios, accounting for over 70% of corporate lending.[9]These risks also extend to our own holdings of corporate bonds.
Finally, these risks are also unique in that, unlike for instance geopolitical risks, central banks can contribute towards mitigating them.
There is broad political consensus on the need to tackle the causes of climate risks. And while governments are in the lead and have the most powerful tools, we can also play our part, within our mandate, in preparing the economy for the future.
So, what is the ECB doing?
What the ECB is doing
First of all, we are maintaining price stability, which is essential for the transition to a low-carbon and circular economy.
The green transition requires substantial investment, and a stable inflation outlook gives firms greater visibility on investment costs, which is particularly important for green projects given their long-term planning horizons. Moreover, price stability supports the relative price signals from policies such as carbon pricing, improving their efficiency.
But beyond creating the right conditions for investment, we are committed to playing our part to address climate change, within our mandate. Our approach can be summarised with three key words: analysing, advising and acting.
Analysing
The basis of contributing to addressing climate change – within the scope of our tasks – is our analysis of how it affects the economy, the financial system and our own activities.
In recent years, we have made significant strides in understanding climate risks. Our findings show that delaying the green transition may result in increased long-term costs.[10]Furthermore, climate change may pose systemic risks to financial stability[11], and the degradation of nature may pose additional risks in this area.[12]
But there is still more ground to cover. That is why we have announced our Climate and Nature Plan 2024-2025[13], which builds on existing work and explores new frontiers. It calls for robust analysis, and we have identified three core areas for this analysis.
First, we are delving deeper into the green transition’s impact on labour markets, economic shocks and investment needs.For example, ECB research shows that the 2022 heatwave in Europe increased food price inflation in the euro area by around 0.7 percentage points.[14]
Second, we are further enhancing our understanding of the physical impacts of climate change. For instance, only about a quarter of losses owing to climate-related catastrophes are currently insured in the EU. In some countries, the figure is less than 5%.[15]
And third, we are exploring the risks stemming from nature loss and degradation.This degradation affects the economy and financial risks, with over half of global GDP – approximately €40 trillion – strongly dependent on nature.[16]
Furthermore, we carry out regular climate-related stress tests of the banking system. These assessments evaluate banks’ resilience to various climate scenarios and cover approximately 2.9 million companies and over 2,900 banks. Our second stress test, conducted in 2023, revealed that banks are exposed to the highest credit risk if the green transition is rushed at a later stage and investment is required quickly at higher costs. In the “late push” transition scenario, banks can expect to see their credit risk more than double by 2030 compared with 2022.[17]
Advising
The results of this analysis influence our own internal thinking and guide our approach to policymaking, allowing us to offer better-informed and more targeted advice.
For example, in European and international fora we support the implementation of key preconditions for the green transition, such as an effective carbon price that reflects the true social cost of carbon emissions, better and more comprehensive climate disclosures and the completion of the EU capital markets union.
We formulate recommendations in the form of legal opinions on climate-related legislation, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.
And we aim to disseminate our analysis to enrich the wider policy debate and raise awareness of the potential impacts of climate change, including through our involvement in the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).
In this context, the ECB has contributed to key areas of the NGFS work programme, such as the Workstream on Scenario Design and Analysis. This workstream offers an invaluable climate risk assessment tool that provides policymakers globally with essential guidance.[18]Furthermore, we chair the NGFS Experts’ Network on Legal Issues. The work on climate litigation has been instrumental in increasing awareness of this growing source of risk.[19]
Acting
And that leads me to my final point. Building on our analysis, the ECB acts within its mandate to contribute to mitigating and averting climate risks. In recent years, we have significantly stepped up our activities.
On the monetary policy front, in October 2022 we began tilting the reinvestments of our corporate bond holdings towards issuers with a better climate performance.[20]Since then, the weighted average carbon intensity of our corporate bond purchases has decreased by more than 65%. Moreover, climate-related financial risks are now considered in regular reviews of collateral haircut schedules.[21]
And following the recent review of our operational framework, we decided to introduce climate-related disclosure requirements in the collateral framework from 2026.[22]
We also ensure, as a supervisory authority, that banks integrate climate and nature-related risks into their strategy, governance and risk management. We have issued binding supervisory decisions for banks to carry out so-called materiality assessments of climate and nature-related risks.[23]At the end of 2023 around 90% of the banks under our supervision considered climate and environmental risks to be material.[24]
In the area of payments, we are reducing the environmental footprint of banknotes and payment systems. We use 100% sustainable cotton for banknotes and have banned the disposal of banknote waste in landfills.[25]
Finally, we are committed to reducing our own environmental footprint. Since 2010 the ECB has run a certified environmental management system covering its operations. Over the last ten years, we have reduced electricity and heating consumption per workplace by 30% and 49%, respectively.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Maurice Allais once wisely remarked that what essentially defines us is our relentless effort to understand the profound nature of an often indecipherable world.[26]
This is the challenge that central banks face in a rapidly changing world. However, when it comes to climate, we cannot merely strive to better understand our world’s complexities or avoid making things worse. We must also contribute to making things better.
Climate and nature-related risks are unique and will continue to increase, and they will only grow in importance over time.
So, within our mandate, the ECB will continue to analyse climate risks, to advise stakeholders and, importantly, to act."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a conference organised by Stiftung Geld und Währung on 25 years of the euro – Perspectives for monetary and fiscal policy in an unstable world, at a panel on “Inflation and public budget. Is monetary policy dominated by fiscal policy?”
Frankfurt, 7 June 2024
In the past four years, the euro area has faced several severe shocks that caused a fundamental shift in the macroeconomic environment.
The long period of very low inflation and low interest rates ended abruptly with the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response to the sharp increase in inflation, the ECB hiked interest rates at an unprecedented scale, which markedly increased funding costs for governments, households and firms.
Governments reacted to the pandemic and the war with wide-ranging support measures that were aimed at cushioning their negative impact on income, employment and growth. This led to a significant increase in government debt as a share of gross domestic product, which was softened by the rise in inflation.
Today’s public debt ratio of 90% in the euro area remains close to its high reached during the European debt crisis, by far exceeding the ceiling of 60% set out in the Maastricht Treaty, while there are still considerable differences between Member States (Slide 2, left-hand side).
Fiscal measures played a key role in overcoming the crises. However, the new interest rate environment means that the high debt levels, in particular in highly indebted countries, will result in a considerably higher interest burden in the coming years (Slide 2, right-hand side).
The question therefore arises of whether monetary policy’s ability to act – and therefore its independence – is being constrained by fiscal policy. This is called fiscal dominance.[1]
My key message is that over the past few years the ECB has pursued its price stability target with great determination, providing credible evidence of monetary dominance.
At the same time, it managed to prevent fragmentation in the euro area, without undermining the disciplinary effect of financial markets. In future, it will mostly be up to fiscal policy to protect central bank independence by advancing fiscal consolidation in line with the new European fiscal rules while not neglecting investments urgently needed to meet future challenges.
The determined monetary policy response to the steepest rise in inflation in the history of the euro area convincingly demonstrates that the ECB has by no means deviated from its price stability mandate as predicted by the fiscal dominance theory.
Within a short period of 14 months the ECB raised interest rates, sometimes in big increments, by a total of 4.5 percentage points (Slide 3, left-hand side). It also began to swiftly reduce its balance sheet, mostly by phasing out targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) as well as by ending net asset purchases and then reinvestments under the asset purchase programmes (Slide 3, right-hand side).
Critics may argue that the monetary policy response was too hesitant at first. It was not until 12 months after inflation exceeded our 2% target that interest rates were raised for the first time, in July 2022.
However, two facts are worth bearing in mind here.
First, the monetary policy turnaround started as early as December 2021, with the announcement of the end of net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).[2]So financing conditions started to tighten well before the first interest rate hike (Slide 4).
Second, the hesitation to act needs to be seen in the context of a decade of very low inflation and heightened uncertainty due to reoccurring waves of the pandemic.
Central banks only gradually became convinced that the repeated errors in forecasting inflation suggested a sustained increase in inflation that warranted a strong monetary policy response.
The most important evidence of the ECB’s credibility can be found in the development of longer-term inflation expectations.[3]
At first, the ECB welcomed the increase in inflation expectations towards its inflation target of 2% (Slide 5, left-hand side). However, inflation expectations soon began to overshoot that target, with both market- and survey-based indicators pointing to an increasing risk of deanchoring. For a while, a significant part of respondents were expecting medium-term inflation rates well above the inflation target (Slide 5, right-hand side).
In the meantime, however, expectations have returned to the vicinity of our medium-term inflation target of 2%. The broad stability of long-term inflation expectations disproves the theory of fiscal dominance. It rather suggests that our monetary policy response has strengthened the confidence households, firms and market participants have in the ECB’s commitment to bring inflation sustainably back to our 2% target.
This was a remarkable success for monetary policy, which contributed to our decision yesterday to lower interest rates by 25 basis points. However, as the future inflation outlook remains uncertain, we cannot pre-commit to a particular rate path.
The sharp increase in the ECB’s interest rates did not trigger a sustained rise in sovereign bond spreads between Member States (Slide 6, left-hand side). Some observers have interpreted this as a sign of fiscal dominance. They claim that the ECB may be keeping risk premia artificially low by investing in sovereign bonds of selected highly indebted countries, thus undermining fiscal discipline. In the medium term, so the argument goes, this could lead to fiscal dominance and higher inflation.
Yet, it needs to be borne in mind that when interest rates started rising, sovereign bond yields rose significantly for all Member States (Slide 6, right-hand side). Today, average yields on ten-year sovereign bonds in the euro area are around three percentage points higher than just before the pandemic. This significant increase provides a clear incentive for all Member States to reduce their debt levels.
The yield increases were largely due to rising interest rate expectations and term premia, while credit risk premia – measured here by credit default swaps – remained remarkably stable or even fell slightly (Slide 7, left-hand side).
There are various factors that can help explain recent developments in credit risk premia.
The most important one is the comparably benign economic development of more highly indebted countries. While economic growth is particularly depressed in the “safe haven” of Germany, the countries that were in crisis before have fared much better since (Slide 7, right-hand side).
Higher long-term growth, in turn, supports debt sustainability. Ultimately, the level of risk premia is dependent on the differential between interest rates and growth (r-g).
The positive economic development in parts of the euro area is, first and foremost, the result of years of effort invested into strengthening resilience and economic dynamism after the sovereign debt crisis.
The European fiscal measures in response to the pandemic – in particular the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme – are likely to have played an important role as well.
First, countries with higher debt levels benefit from NGEU funds to a larger extent, which should support euro area convergence in the long run by increasing potential growth in these countries.
Second, NGEU was a strong vote of confidence in Europe’s ability to act. NGEU is a symbol of a Europe capable of handling crises decisively together. It likely has sustainably lowered the risk of fragmentation in the euro area – contributing to lower bond spreads.
The second factor is that the future debt burden depends on average yields, not just current interest rates.
Before the pandemic, many governments locked in low interest rates by issuing long-term bonds. The average bond maturity of euro area countries rose from around six to eight years (Slide 8, left-hand side). Therefore, a large part of outstanding debt still benefits from low interest rates (Slide 8, right-hand side).
Finally, the third factor behind low risk premia is the current high risk appetite displayed by investors in global financial markets.[4]
The risk premia for European corporate bonds have fallen sharply since the beginning of monetary policy tightening, while equity markets are booming, likewise largely due to the falling risk premia (Slide 9).
The resilience of asset prices can probably be explained in part by the fact that excess liquidity remains high. The ECB and other central banks have adopted a gradual and cautious approach to balance sheet reduction as going too fast could cause disturbances in financial markets.
Such constraints, which may restrict the central bank’s ability to act, need to be carefully examined as part of the proportionality assessment when asset purchases are being considered as a monetary policy instrument.[5]
That said, the gradual and predictable approach to balance sheet reduction contributed to a smooth exit that also benefitted from favourable market conditions.
Recently, the record volume of government bond issuance has met with strong demand in financial markets. The bid-to-cover ratios, a measure used to gauge demand relative to supply in bond markets, have consistently increased since the start of 2023 (Slide 10).
Given the anticipated peak in interest rates, investors were keen to lock in the attractive yields over the long term. As the Eurosystem reduced its presence in sovereign and corporate bond markets, notably foreign investors returned as yields in the euro area had become considerably more attractive (Slide 11).[6]In some Member States, domestic households also played a significant role as purchasers of government bonds.
The ECB’s withdrawal from asset purchases was thus supported by favourable macroeconomic and global conditions.
In June 2022, however, when the ECB’s Governing Council announced its intention to increase interest rates for the first time at its next monetary policy meeting, such a smooth interest rate cycle could not have been foreseen. Just shortly after the monetary policy meeting, sharp movements in bond markets emerged.[7]
This dynamic was triggered by concerns that inflation would be more persistent than expected. These concerns were prompted by poor inflation data from the United States, which led to a sharp rise in US yields – for example of around 70 basis points for the two-year US Treasury within one week. Market turbulence was hence by no means confined to the euro area.
However, the architecture of the euro area carries a particular risk of self-reinforcing interest rate dynamics. As investors can quickly transfer funds from one part of the monetary union to another part that is regarded as a safe haven, without incurring any currency risk, the combination of national fiscal policy and European monetary policy can – in times of great uncertainty – result in sudden interest rate spirals in bond markets.
Past experience shows that such interest rate spirals can make single monetary policy impossible. If sovereign bond yields of different Member States diverge abruptly, a smooth transmission of monetary policy across the whole euro area can no longer be ensured.
In the conditions prevailing at the time, the necessary interest rate steps could therefore have led to disproportionately higher interest rate adjustments in parts of the euro area.
In response to this market turbulence, the ECB announced its Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in July 2022.[8]The TPI aims to ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy by countering disorderly market dynamics, unwarranted by fundamentals.
The TPI sets clear conditions for the purchase of a Member State’s bonds. These conditions are intended to ensure that the instrument is only used in countries that pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies.
The TPI is hence not simply a continuation of the flexibility under the PEPP. During the pandemic the latter allowed for conducting asset purchases flexibly over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This flexibility was used temporarily at the outset of the pandemic and at the start of the hiking cycle to counteract disorderly movements in bond prices. However, deviations from the ECB’s capital key remained limited.
Speculation that the ECB has permanently skewed its asset purchases in certain directions is unfounded. Temporary fluctuations in the capital key often occurred for technical reasons and, as shown by the examples of Italy and France, added up to zero over the entire calendar year 2023 (Slide 12).[9]
The TPI, by contrast, is a new instrument in the ECB’s toolkit. Its targeted orientation and conditionality ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy, even in times of heightened uncertainty and volatility, thus enabling monetary policy to pursue its key task of maintaining price stability.[10]
By announcing possible interventions or, if necessary, by carrying out targeted, temporary interventions, the central bank can quickly restore confidence and prevent destabilising interest rate spirals, which might otherwise drag the euro area into a severe crisis.
In this respect, the TPI is an expression of monetary rather than fiscal dominance. Indeed, the announcement of the TPI is likely to have been an essential precondition for the ECB to be able to increase rates to such a large extent and so avoid a deanchoring of inflation expectations and ensure price stability.
Under the TPI, the ECB cannot counter persistent tensions that are due to country fundamentals. It could only do so in combination with a macroeconomic adjustment programme under the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme.
These precautions ensure that market discipline is preserved. Within the TPI there is no interest rate level that is targeted; this level remains fully determined in the market, with the substantial differences in sovereign bond yields across euro area countries reflecting different fundamentals. The TPI can only be used to tackle disorderly dynamics that temporarily prevent price determination in the market. These conditions preserve the incentive for sound fiscal policies.
The best protection against fiscal dominance is therefore a future-proof fiscal policy. This is precisely why the European Treaties provide for a fiscal framework that permanently guarantees the central bank’s independence.
The challenges for fiscal policy are likely to increase in future.
As long as the yields on newly issued sovereign bonds surpass the average yields on outstanding debt, the interest burden will increase. For example, a prolonged period of high interest rates will gradually affect the interest-growth differential (r-g), which, in addition to the evolution of government primary balances, determines the development of public debt ratios (Slide 13, left-hand side).[11]
Whether (r-g) will become a burden in the medium term will largely depend on how fiscal policy will tackle the multiple structural challenges facing our economies.
An ageing society, the need for higher defence spending in view of the changed geopolitical situation, as well as the green and digital transformations require substantial additional public spending.
The huge investment required to meet all of these challenges suggests that the era of very low interest rates is likely to be over, also in the medium to long term.[12]
This calls for policies that, on the one hand, take advantage of times of favourable cyclical developments to consolidate public finances but, on the other, prioritise necessary investment and structural reforms.
The new European fiscal framework provides for precisely such a balance.
Current projections give cause for concern, however. Structural primary balances in 2024 and 2025 are expected to remain well below pre-pandemic levels, thereby putting upward pressure on government debt (Slide 13, right-hand side). One reason for this is that some government support measures taken during the crisis years were not fully phased out.
The lack of fiscal consolidation, despite high debt levels, may impede monetary policy and heighten the risk of fiscal dominance.[13]
Measures to strengthen long-term growth are equally important.
Europe plays a central role here. It still offers considerable unexploited growth potential. Deeper integration of the internal market for services could boost productivity, as could the urgently needed progress on the banking union and the capital markets union.
NGEU can accompany this process. However, it’s not yet certain whether this programme can meet the high expectations. A successful evaluation of the programme is likely to determine whether a follow-up programme is eventually conceivable at European level.
At the same time, structural reforms to improve labour mobility, increase labour market participation, promote lifelong education and exploit the potential of new technologies such as artificial intelligence are essential.
It is precisely in the area of information and communication technology that many firms domiciled in the euro area are lagging behind global developments.[14]
Reforms that increase potential output would not only ease debt reduction but would also reduce inflation pressures in the long run. This is all the more important at a time of looming de-globalisation and climate change, when the European economy is likely to be more exposed to supply-side shocks.
This brings me to the conclusion that monetary policy was not dominated by fiscal policy in recent years and that monetary policy’s ability to act was ensured.
The determined monetary policy response to the sharp increase in inflation and the anchoring of inflation expectations despite inflation rates in double digits show that monetary policy has unwaveringly pursued its objective of price stability and that confidence in monetary policy has successfully been preserved.
The TPI made a decisive contribution by ensuring a smooth transmission and was thus a prerequisite for being able to resolutely tackle the inflation problem. Self-reinforcing interest rate spirals run counter to the objective of price stability. The design of the programme ensures that the disciplining effect of financial markets is not undermined.
In the coming years, a future-proof fiscal policy will be a prerequisite for safeguarding the independence of monetary policy. Fiscal consolidation in line with the new European fiscal rules, while prioritising investment in the future, is essential to safeguard long-term growth and price stability.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2024 BOJ-IMES Conference on “Price Dynamics and Monetary Policy Challenges: Lessons Learned and Going Forward”
Tokyo, 28 May 2024
Since the global financial crisis in 2008, many central banks around the world have used asset purchases when conducting monetary policy. In the euro area, for example, asset purchases were actively used in 13 out of the past 15 years.
In response to the post-pandemic surge in inflation, most central banks stopped net purchases and started to reduce their bond holdings. As this process is unfolding, it is now a good time to start reflecting on the experience of using asset purchases and to evaluate their benefits and costs by drawing on the growing body of research on their effects on financial markets and the broader economy.
My main message today is that asset purchases can be a powerful tool when financial markets are in turmoil. Outside these periods, however, central banks need to carefully assess whether the benefits of asset purchases outweigh the costs.
Why central banks use asset purchases
Central banks have used asset purchases for two main purposes.
One was to respond to disturbances in monetary policy transmission and to stabilise financial markets in periods of illiquidity and turmoil.
In the United States, for example, the first large-scale asset purchase programme, QE1, was launched with a view to supporting market functioning after the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008.[1]
In the euro area, asset purchases were first used to revive the covered bond market in 2009, which had been affected particularly severely by the global financial crisis.[2]One year later, in 2010, the ECB started to purchase securities under the Securities Markets Programme to address severe tensions in certain market segments, which had been hampering the monetary policy transmission mechanism.[3]
More recently, the Bank of England conducted asset purchases to restore market functioning after gilt bond yields rose sharply on forced selling by pension and liability driven investment (LDI) funds.[4]
The second, complementary purpose, which became increasingly important after the global financial crisis, was to ease financing conditions with a view to stimulating aggregate demand in the vicinity of the effective lower bound on interest rates.
Starting in the mid-1980s, structural changes in savings and investment implied that the natural rate of interest, or r* – the real rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary – had steadily fallen (Slide 2, left-hand chart).[5]This decline largely reflected the effects of an ageing population and lower productivity growth.
So, when the global financial crisis hit in 2008, many central banks had to lower their key policy rates to close to zero and make use of other instruments to deliver financing conditions that would be consistent with their mandates (Slide 2, right-hand chart).[6]
Although the use of these instruments differed across economies and over time, asset purchases, together with forward guidance and longer-term refinancing operations, eventually became part of the toolkit of many central banks.
In the euro area, it was only in 2015 that the ECB started to use bond purchases as a tool to counter downside risks to the inflation outlook.[7]Under the asset purchase programme (APP), the ECB bought large amounts of government and private sector bonds with the aim to bring inflation back to the ECB’s target.
After the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, many central banks, including the ECB, used asset purchases with both objectives in mind: to stabilise financial markets and to ease financing conditions in the pursuit of price stability.[8]The ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), for example, explicitly embodied both purposes in one programme.[9]
How do asset purchases work?
Although asset purchases have by now become much less “unconventional” – as also acknowledged in the ECB’s 2021 monetary policy strategy review –, their use remains controversial among both central bank observers and policymakers. Part of the controversy reflects the difficulty in drawing robust conclusions about how asset purchases work, and what long-term socio-economic consequences and side effects they may have.
Ben Bernanke once famously said that “the problem with quantitative easing is that it works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory”.[10]The case for irrelevance is based on the “Wallace neutrality”, which states that changes in the size and composition of a central bank balance sheet should – under certain conditions – have no effect on asset prices, output or inflation.[11]
The concept of Wallace neutrality gave rise to the belief that asset purchases may predominantly work through asignalling channel– that is, they would be similar to forward guidance in that they signal a commitment to an extended period of low short-term interest rates.
According to this channel, the central bank’s exposure to duration risk underscores its commitment to follow through on its promise, as raising interest rates would lead to losses on its bond holdings.[12]And, indeed, research shows that announcements of asset purchase programmes lowered policy rate expectations.[13]
The experience over the past two years, however, is likely to have significantly weakened the role of asset purchases as a commitment device. The determined response to the surge in inflation by central banks worldwide was a forceful reminder that policymakers cannot tie themselves to the mast of a ship as Odysseus did in Greek mythology.[14]
Central banks can only credibly communicate about the likely future direction of monetary policy in a “Delphic” way – that is conditional on how the economy evolves.
So, while asset purchases may convey signals about how central banks see the economy evolving, they will not make central banks less determined in their pursuit of price stability if conditions change unexpectedly.
Asset purchases have broader effects on the economy, however, as the real world departs from the Wallace neutrality in several ways. For example, for asset purchases to affect asset prices, it is enough to assume that investors are not perfectly indifferent about the assets they hold, an idea going back to James Tobin.[15]
A large class of investors, for example, values the liquidity and safety of government bonds, which is reflected in these bonds’ convenience yield.[16]Financial intermediaries also generally face limits to arbitrage because of liquidity and risk constraints.[17]
These imperfections and inefficiencies considerably broaden the way asset purchases can affect financial and macroeconomic outcomes. The economics profession has generally focused on two main transmission channels: the liquidity channel and the portfolio rebalancing channel.[18]
Asset purchases are powerful in periods of stress
The experience from the past 15 years suggests that asset purchases have on several occasions been instrumental in stabilising financial markets and shielding households and firms from economic pain.[19]
After the outbreak of COVID-19, for example, when balance sheet constraints and information asymmetries led to a freezing of financial markets, asset purchases supported dealers’ ability to intermediate the market.[20]
This reduced systemic stress, prevented broader fire sales and thus averted an excessive tightening of financing conditions that could have threatened the stability of the financial system at large (Slide 3).
Empirical evidence for the United States shows that, when there is a “dash for cash”, it is the actual purchases that matter: the Federal Reserve’s announcement in March 2020 that it would conduct asset purchases was not sufficient to stop the rise in Treasury yields.[21]The market only stabilised once the purchases started.
This is theliquidity channelat work. It is particularly effective when liquidity shortages arise outside the banking sector, as non-bank financial intermediaries – whose role in the financial system has grown steadily over the past years in the euro area – usually do not have direct access to the central bank balance sheet.
On other occasions, it has been enough for central banks to announce their intention to intervene if necessary. This is typically the case in the presence of “multiple equilibria” when concerns about a debtor’s ability to service its liabilities may become self-fulfilling.[22]
Such belief-driven price spirals – if left unaddressed – can quickly turn a liquidity crisis into a solvency crisis, giving rise to huge costs for society as a whole.[23]
The Eurosystem faced such risks during both the sovereign debt crisis and the pandemic.
This experience suggests that measures aimed at addressing belief-driven spirals tend to be most effective, and their impact longer lasting, if their potential purchase volumes are large and if they are communicated clearly.[24]
That is, the more credible the announcement is, the less likely actual interventions become.[25]This has been most visible in the case of the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) in 2012. Although the OMT programme was never activated, it lastingly instilled confidence and allowed the market to coordinate on the “good” equilibrium (Slide 4, left-hand side).[26]
The announcement of the operational details of the PEPP in 2020 had similar effects: the decision that purchases could be allocated flexibly across time, asset classes and countries removed concerns about policy space and thereby stopped price spirals before they could get out of control.
In the end, the overall deviations from the ECB’s capital key, which serves as a benchmark for the allocation of government bond purchases in the euro area, turned out to be limited and transitory (Slide 4, right-hand side).
Announcing the willingness to conduct asset purchases in certain circumstances can thus be a powerful tool to overcome market segmentation and protect the public from unwarranted, destabilising forces.
At the same time, market interventions, or announcements thereof, can create risks of moral hazard. These risks were limited in the case of the pandemic, which was an exogenous shock of unprecedented dimension. But they become larger in less exceptional circumstances.
For these reasons, the use of the OMT programme comes with strict conditionality in the form of a macroeconomic adjustment programme. In the same vein, when the ECB’s Governing Council announced the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in 2022 – an instrument that can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics to ensure smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area – it clarified that eligibility requires governments to pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies and that purchases could not be conducted if persistent tensions reflected country fundamentals.[27]
These clauses are important for a central bank’s credibility: inflation expectations will only remain anchored if the public believes that central banks’ actions to stabilise financial markets will not undermine their commitment to achieving their primary objective of price stability.[28]
Without a clear exit strategy, it would be difficult to distinguish purchases conducted for market stabilisation purposes from quantitative easing (QE).[29]The Bank of England’s response to the LDI crisis is a prime example of how such an exit strategy can be designed successfully. In other words, for an inflation-targeting central bank, there can be no trade-off between market stabilisation and price stability.[30]
For the TPI, one may even argue that market stabilisation and price stability are two sides of the same coin: without the ECB’s determination to ensure a smooth transmission of monetary policy across the entire euro area, the historically steep hiking cycle may not have been feasible.
Effects of asset purchases are weaker outside crises
The second main transmission channel of asset purchases is theportfolio rebalancing channel. This channel is at the heart of quantitative easing – a key tool used by central banks to stimulate aggregate demand and inflation when interest rates are constrained by the effective lower bound.
The aim is twofold: first, to reduce long-term government bond yields by removing aggregate duration risk from the market. And second, to encourage banks and investors to use the larger risk absorption capacity to extend credit to the real economy or to buy other, riskier assets, thereby compressing risk premia more broadly.[31]
Measuring and evaluating the impact of the portfolio rebalancing channel is considerably more difficult, as it requires establishing a full chain of causality running from the effect of asset purchases on financing conditions and then further to aggregate demand and inflation.
Identification typically starts with high-frequency event studies that are used to quantify the effect of asset purchase programme announcements on asset prices. A large body of such studies suggests that QE announcements lower bond yields and raise other asset prices.[32]
However, these effects have been found to be considerably smaller outside crisis periods, when balance sheet constraints and limits to arbitrage are less binding. For instance, evidence from the PEPP and APP announcements suggests that the effect on long-term yields could be as much as 40% smaller in non-crisis periods (Slide 5, left-hand side). This is consistent with evidence that, in the United States, QE1 was more effective than other asset purchase programmes.[33]
The implication is that the purchase volumes required to ease financing conditions sufficiently to generate upward pressure on inflation are often considerable. Under the APP and the PEPP, the Eurosystem bond holdings reached, at the peak, more than €5 trillion, or around 35% of euro area nominal GDP (Slide 5, right-hand side). The holdings reached similar shares in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Whether such large purchase volumes are proportionate to the achievement of price stability critically depends on the effects of easier financial conditions on growth and inflation as well as the costs associated with conducting QE. The balancing of benefits and costs is at the core of the proportionality assessment that the ECB conducts for all its policy decisions.
The impact of QE on the economy is state dependent
Like for other jurisdictions, the available evidence points to notable benefits from using asset purchases as a policy instrument in the vicinity of the effective lower bound.
Specifically, asset purchases have been found to have lifted growth and generated upward pressure on inflation.[34]They thus played an important role in meeting central banks’ primary objective during the period of low inflation, also by contributing to inflation expectations not falling further during the long period of low inflation.
The evidence since the global financial crisis suggests, however, that the effects of QE on activity and prices are state-dependent and can vary over time.
There are two broad sets of conditions that seem most relevant.
The first is the strength of balance sheets.[35]When the ECB first conducted QE between 2015 and 2018, governments were consolidating public finances following the sovereign debt crisis and banks were building up capital buffers, as non-performing loans remained elevated (Slide 6). As a result, the boost to credit creation was more moderate and underlying inflation responded sluggishly (Slide 7).
But during and after the pandemic, the picture changed dramatically. Fiscal deficits soared, lending to households for house purchases reached growth rates not seen since the global financial crisis, and loan demand by firms went well beyond the drawdown of pre-approved credit lines in 2020.
This reflected the solid balance sheets with which banks, households and firms had entered the crisis, as well as Europe’s common policy response, mainly through Next Generation EU, which mitigated fiscal borrowing constraints at national level.
So, a key takeaway is that the extent to which the economy responds to QE fundamentally depends on the broader state of the economy. QE is most effective when banks, households, firms and governments are both able and willing to respond to low interest rates, thereby boosting economic activity and lifting inflation closer to target.
The second condition relates to the effective lower bound itself.[36]
New research suggests that the responsiveness of aggregate demand to monetary policy shocks may decline when interest rates are already low, even when controlling for the state of the economy or other confounding factors (Slide 8).[37]
This could be because the negative income effect from lower interest rates may partly offset the growth impulse from intertemporal substitution.[38]Or it could be because there are limits to how much consumption can be brought forward from the future to the present, especially after long periods of low interest rates.[39]
Such non-linearities are not restricted to the use of QE. But monetary policy may experience diminishing returns just when QE becomes the marginal policy tool – that is, when the conventional policy space has largely been exhausted and inflation expectations are at risk of becoming unanchored to the downside.
QE may still be helpful in these circumstances, as was the case with the launch of the APP and the PEPP in the euro area. But the benefits may become smaller the larger the stock of acquired assets.
Going forward, central banks need to get a better understanding of how the zero lower bound affects inflation expectations before they act forcefully on them.
For example, new work by economists at the Federal Reserve suggests that the potential decline in the effectiveness of QE to stimulate demand in these conditions may not be that consequential.[40]They find that, in the United States, the zero lower bound constraint exerted only a small drag on inflation expectations over the period from 2008 to 2019.
Whether this was a result of investors viewing the use of unconventional instruments, including asset purchases, as effective substitutes for interest rate cuts, or whether inflation expectations are predominately driven by structural factors outside the realm of monetary policy, remains subject to further analysis.
But related research for a broader set of countries shows that households and firms do not expect deflation even when deflation is likely.[41]So, further evidence is needed to help central banks conduct policy optimally in the vicinity of the effective lower bound.
Taking stock of the costs of QE
Even if asset purchases have clearly quantifiable benefits, they also come with side effects. These may be difficult to assess, as they can materialise with considerable delay. The ECB therefore takes a comprehensive approach to assessing the potential side effects as part of its proportionality assessment.
The experience from the past will help inform future assessments in important ways. Although the side effects of QE have differed in their intensity and duration across countries, a few general observations can be made.
First, QE exposes central banks to considerable interest rate risk. After the pandemic, when policymakers were forced to raise interest rates in the pursuit of their primary mandate, these risks turned into substantial costs for taxpayers worldwide.
These losses need to be viewed against the profits central banks made before the rise in interest rates, but they may still be weighing on central banks’ reputation and credibility.[42]Even if losses do not impede central banks’ ability to pursue their price stability mandate, in several countries they have led to enquiries, warnings and calls for more transparency and research by legislators and other public authorities regarding the future use of asset purchases.[43]
Second, while asset purchases can improve market functioning in periods of turmoil, sustained periods of QE can contribute to a scarcity of government bonds, which may adversely affect financial market conditions.[44]
In the euro area, these effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below the euro short-term rate (€STR), despite the expansion of Eurosystem facilities that lend securities back to the market (Slide 9).
More generally, recent research shows that purchases of 1% of an outstanding bond are associated with a decline of 0.78 basis points in its repo rate.[45]Asset scarcity can thus hamper market functioning and impair the steering of short-term interest rates.[46]
Third, portfolio rebalancing effects may result in excessive risk-taking and increasing inequality.
Price-earnings ratios in stock markets across advanced economies surged to record highs as major global central banks conducted QE before and after the pandemic (Slide 10, left-hand side). In 2021, before policy rates started to rise, spreads in many fixed income markets, including in the euro area, reached their lowest level since the global financial crisis (Slide 10, right-hand side).
While these developments are likely to be the outcome of a combination of factors, including the structural decline in short- and long-term interest rates, it can be expected that QE has contributed to the rise in asset valuations – after all, this is one of its key objectives.
Portfolio rebalancing also extends to real assets, including residential and commercial real estate. Although house prices reflect the interaction of many factors driving demand and supply, research by the International Monetary Fund has found that falling yields may have played a non-negligible role in pushing up real estate prices across advanced economies, especially in major cities.[47]
In the euro area, residential property prices increased by nearly 50% from the start of QE in 2015 to their peak in 2022 (Slide 11, left-hand side).
Surging asset prices do not only pose risks to financial stability but may also exacerbate wealth inequality.[48]While monetary policy always has distributional effects, portfolio rebalancing as part of QE may amplify these effects.
In the euro area, for example, less than 0.1% of households in the bottom net wealth quintile hold bonds, compared with more than 10% of the top decile (Slide 11, right-hand side). And only around 1 to 2% of low-wealth households hold shares in mutual funds and stocks, compared with more than 35% of households in the top net wealth decile.
Therefore, central banks purchasing longer-dated assets disproportionally benefits wealthier households, whose assets tend to have longer durations than their liabilities.[49]At the same time, these effects need to be weighed against the impact of asset purchases on income inequality, where the evidence generally suggests that low-income households benefit more strongly from the boost to growth provided by monetary policy.[50]
Lastly, the experience over the past two years suggests that portfolio rebalancing effects might be highly persistent. Despite the sharp rise in interest rates, stock market valuations remain high, especially in the United States.[51]And house prices have corrected somewhat in some countries but not in others.
In Germany, for example, despite residential real estate prices declining by nearly 13% since mid-2022, prices in metropolitan areas remained some 15% to 20% higher than the values implied by economic fundamentals in 2023.[52]
Several factors, including supply constraints and strong demand in housing markets as well as declining volatility in financial markets, may have contributed to the broad resilience of asset prices.
However, another factor may be the pace with which central banks unwind the stock of purchased assets.[53]Central banks typically take a cautious and gradual approach when reducing the size of their balance sheets, as too fast a decline in bond holdings could cause congestion effects in financial markets and as banks need time to adjust to the fall in excess liquidity.[54]
This gradualism is probably one reason why quantitative tightening (QT) announcements are often found to have smaller effects on bond prices than QE announcements.[55]That is, the stock effect matters also when monetary policy portfolios are reduced. Since bonds held by the central bank mature only gradually, investors may heavily discount redemptions that are due far out in the future.
This is consistent with three pieces of evidence.
First, using micro data on the interest rate and balance sheet expectations of market participants, ECB staff estimate that the unitary effect of QT on term premia is not significantly different from QE (Slide 12, left-hand side).
Second, today, despite the start of QT and the significant increase in public debt in the aftermath of the pandemic, the bond free float in the euro area is not expected to reach the pre-APP level anytime soon (Slide 12, right-hand side).
Third, new empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in the expected path of government debt on interest rates are materially lower – possibly by as much as half of the estimated impact under perfect foresight – when investors have limited foresight for changes that may occur in the distant future.[56]
As a result, risk premia may remain compressed in many market segments, making financial conditions more accommodative than they otherwise would be. This may have weakened the transmission of monetary policy during the recent tightening cycle.
Conclusion
All in all, these considerations suggest that asset purchases should remain part of central banks’ toolkit. They have played an important role in stabilising financial markets at times of stress and in helping central banks preserve price stability during periods of low inflation.
The experience over the past 15 years suggests, however, that the effectiveness of QE in stimulating aggregate demand is state dependent and that QE can come with costs that might be higher than those of other policy instruments.
Two broad lessons can be drawn at this stage.
First, central banks may face shocks in the future where the optimal policy response requires a more patient approach to reaching their inflation aim in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, especially after balance sheet crises. Further research is needed to better understand how sensitive inflation expectations are to perceptions of policy constraints.
Second, central banks can reduce the costs of asset purchases by using them in a more targeted and parsimonious manner, intervening forcefully when needed but stopping them faster. Examples are the commercial paper purchases by the ECB in 2020 and the interventions by the Bank of England during the LDI crisis.
In a bank-based economy like the euro area, the experience also suggests that other measures, such as targeted longer-term refinancing operations, can provide substantial support to the economy in the face of disinflationary shocks and instability, while leaving a smaller and less persistent footprint, as they can be reversed more quickly if conditions change.
As in the past, all policy measures will need to pass the test of our proportionality assessment. The experience gained will help central banks to carefully weigh the benefits and side effects of different policy instruments in order to conduct policy appropriately, given the broader state of the economy.
Thank you."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Institute of International and European Affairs, Dublin
Dublin, 27 May 2024
Introduction
The aim of this speech is to examine inflation in the euro area. In the next section, I review the various inflation indicators tracked by the ECB.[1]Subsequently, I discuss the implications for monetary policy.
Overview of Inflation Indicators
Chart 1 shows the evolution of headline and core inflation since 2019. Let me focus on the disinflation patterns since August 2023 (the month immediately prior to our last rate hike at our September monetary policy meeting). Inflation declined from 5.2 per cent last August to 2.4 percent in April, while core inflation decreased from 5.3 per cent in August to 2.7 per cent in April.
Chart 2 shows the relative contributions of the major categories: energy; food; goods; and services. Services inflation now accounts for the vast bulk of the overall inflation rate. In turn, this reflects the non-uniform dynamics: while the other categories have seen major declines, with the April data indicating energy inflation running at -0.6 per cent, food inflation at 2.8 per cent and goods inflation at 0.9 per cent, services inflation was still elevated at 3.7 per cent.
Chart 3 shows the evolution of the refined versions of the underlying inflation measures tracked by the ECB, which adjust for the temporary impact of energy shocks and supply bottlenecks.[2]The improvements in these measures since August 2023 suggest that the observed disinflation has a substantial persistent component.
While Chart 3 reports broad measures of underlying inflation, Chart 4 examines the domestic inflation rate, which is aggregated across sectors with low import content. The focus on this measure is motivated by the higher sensitivity of domestic inflation to local cost pressures. Although domestic inflation remains quite elevated, the exclusion-type indicators (weighted median and trimmed measures) suggest that the breadth of the domestic inflation dynamic is narrowing.
In a similar vein, Chart 5 shows services inflation. In April, services inflation declined slightly to 3.7 per cent. The decline in services inflation since last summer has largely been in non-labour-intensive services sectors, reflecting the indirect impact of lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the fading out of pandemic reopening effects in these sectors. As shown in Chart 5, there is a relatively tight medium-term relation between wage inflation and the inflation rate for labour-intensive services sectors (which make up a large part of the domestic inflation component). Over time, deceleration in wage growth is necessary in order for services inflation to converge to a rate that is consistent with meeting the two per cent target for overall inflation.[3]
In relation to wage dynamics, Chart 6 shows the evolution of compensation per employee and compensation per hour until Q4 2023 and negotiated wages until Q1 2024, while Chart 7 shows a set of wage trackers.[4]The ECB wage tracker – an important tool used to assess wage developments across the euro area – is signalling that overall wage pressures have moderated since 2023.[5]Furthermore, the Indeed wage tracker – which reflects the wages offered in job postings and thereby should be a leading indicator for overall wage dynamics – has materially decelerated in recent months.[6]
At the same time, wage growth is expected to remain elevated in 2024, and to show a bumpy profile. These developments reflect the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process as workers continue to recoup real wage losses from past price shocks, as well as the important role of one-off payments in this process. Such one-off payments are also behind the increase in euro area negotiated wage growth in the first quarter. Similarly, one-off payments likely played a significant role in the increase in the growth rate of the “wages and salaries” component in the experimental flash release for Eurostat’s labour cost index (LCI) for Q1 2024, which jumped to 5.0 per cent from 3.2 per cent in Q4 2023.
The impact of higher wages on price pressures depends on the rate of labour productivity growth. In 2023, labour productivity fell, such that unit labour costs grew more quickly than wages. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2024 suggest that aggregate labour productivity was constant; given the strongly pro-cyclical behaviour of labour productivity, the March staff projections foresee labour productivity growing at 0.1 per cent in 2024, 1.2 per cent in 2025 and 1.2 per cent in 2026 due to the output recovery outpacing employment growth.[7]Under this baseline, unit labour costs will grow more slowly than nominal wages.
In addition to a slower rate of growth of labour costs, deceleration in domestic inflation also requires compression in profits. The annual growth in unit profits peaked at 9.4 per cent in the last quarter of 2022 and stood at 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. The March projections exercise foresees unit profit growth turning negative in 2024, implying that profits will buffer the relatively strong labour cost growth. Unit profit growth is then expected to recover somewhat from 2025, helped by a robust economic recovery and strengthening productivity growth.
As shown in Charts 8 and 9, feedback from firms participating in the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS) and the Survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) points to lower wage growth this year. The March 2024 staff projections foresee subsequent phases of further wage deceleration in 2025 and 2026, with the growth rate of compensation per employee declining from 5.3 per cent in 2023 to 4.5 per cent in 2024, 3.6 per cent in 2025 and 3.0 per cent in 2026.
Finally, Chart 10 shows some forecasts of near-term inflation dynamics for the rest of 2024. Due to the swings in energy prices during 2023, there will be oscillations in base effects in the monthly inflation readings during 2024, while the staggered reversal of various temporary fiscal supports will also have uneven effects on price levels. Both headline inflation and core inflation are expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year.
Even if inflation does not smoothly decline during the rest of 2024, further disinflation can be expected in the course of 2025. This next phase of disinflation should be underpinned by the lowering of labour cost pressures, ongoing compression of unit profits, the dissipation of the adverse effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the pandemic reopening, and the further unfolding of the disinflationary impact of the restrictive monetary policy stance. This disinflationary dynamic is consistent with both inflation stabilising at our target later in 2025 and a substantial economic recovery. The latter will be supported by rising real incomes, improvements in the terms of trade and the prospect of disinflation unlocking future interest rate reductions and boosting domestic consumption and investment, while the normalisation of foreign demand will facilitate growth in exports. The sustainable attainment of the medium-term inflation target would be difficult in the absence of sufficient growth to foster the demand conditions that would be aligned with an overall inflation rate of two per cent.
Finally, it is essential to track the evolution of inflation risk, in addition to indicators of the expected inflation path. The lowering of perceived inflation risk since last summer is plausibly connected to the faster-than-expected decline in inflation (even if this has somewhat reversed in the initial months of 2024): the September 2023 staff projections pencilled in 2024 inflation at 3.2 per cent, while the March projections revised 2024 inflation down to 2.3 per cent. Since last summer, a range of measures show that near-term inflation expectations have also come down and that the risk of inflation staying above target in the long term has diminished: the right tail in the distribution of long-term inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters has markedly diminished compared to the peak inflation phase in late 2022; the inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps has declined by about 40 basis points since last summer; the option-implied probability of above 2.5 per cent inflation in the five-year-on-five-year interval has dropped, while the option-implied probability of below 1.5 per cent inflation has picked up; to the Consumer Expectations Survey, households have recognised the improvement in inflation outcomes and marked down their near-term inflation expectations; according to the results from the SAFE, firms have lowered their near-term inflation expectations, while the proportion of firms fearing high inflation in the medium term has decreased.[8]
Implications for monetary policy
The role of monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large inflation shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through medium-term inflation expectations shifting above our two per cent target. This has required a substantial adjustment in monetary policy for two reasons: first, in the normalisation phase, to avoid that excessively-low nominal interest rates would pro-cyclically add to the initial inflation shock; and, second, in the restrictiveness phase, to make sure that demand conditions are dampened, so as to ensure that the multi-round adjustment process for prices and wages is consistent with a timely return of inflation to the two per cent target.
Put differently, the aim of a restrictive monetary policy stance is to limit the persistence of backward-looking inflation dynamics and steer forward-looking inflation dynamics towards the medium-term anchor. While backward-looking inflation dynamics continue to play out (especially in relation to domestic/services inflation), these should continue to ease over the next year due to several factors: (a) with significant progress in 2023 and 2024 in reversing the real wage gap that was generated by the 2021-2022 inflation surge, wage growth should be lower in 2025 than in 2024; (b) with 2024 inflation lower than 2023 inflation, there will be less catch-up pressure from post-shock inflation on prices and wages in 2025; (c) the upward impact from the reversal of fiscal measures and energy base effects will be less relevant in 2025 than in 2024; and (d) the lagged impact of monetary policy tightening will still be contributing significantly to disinflation dynamics during 2025. With forward-looking inflation expectations well anchored, the dissipation of the backward-looking component will underpin the convergence in inflation towards the target.
At our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. Among other considerations, the subsequent pace of rate cuts will be slower if there are upward surprises to underlying inflation (especially in relation to the underlying dynamics of domestic inflation and services inflation) and the level of demand (in view of the implications of demand conditions for the medium-term inflation outlook) and will be faster if there are downward surprises to underlying inflation and the level of demand.[9]
The future rate path will also depend on the evolving strength of monetary transmission. First, given the lags in transmission, the tightening effects from our past interest rate hikes are still unfolding. While the impact of the tightening cycle on economic activity might have reached its maximum level at the turn of this year, model-based analysis suggests that the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead.[10]
Second, with expected inflation at various horizons now lower than at the date of our last rate hike, a given nominal interest rate now maps into a higher real interest rate. It is straightforward that the calibration of the appropriate degree of restrictiveness should adjust for the impact of lower expected inflation.
Third, the overall restrictiveness of aggregate financial conditions also depends on the evolution of term premia and risk premia. Among other factors, these will be influenced by developments in global financial markets.
The future rate path will also be guided by our management of the two-sided risks in proceeding through the next phase. In one direction, easing the stance too quickly would not be consistent with inflation sustainably returning to target if inflation turns out to be more persistent than anticipated. In the other direction, keeping rates overly restrictive for too long could push inflation below target over the medium term. This would require corrective action through a subsequent acceleration in rate cuts that could even require having to descend to below-neutral levels to fix any persistent drift towards a below-target inflation trend.
In deciding on the appropriate policy rate path, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. This approach has served us well in the tightening cycle and many of the same considerations will apply during the unwinding phase.[11]"

Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Festival dell’ Economia di Trento
Trento, 26 May 2024
It is a great pleasure to be here.
As we meet today, we find ourselves at a critical juncture. Faced with the severe negative effects of climate change, we have to act swiftly while seizing the economic opportunities that the green transition offers.
I would like to focus on three important aspects. I will first talk about the increasing costs of climate change and the considerable investments the green transition requires. I will then discuss the implications for central banks and the role that the ECB can play. And finally, I will outline how this role interacts with the actions of other policymakers across Europe when it comes to facing the challenges ahead.
The growing cost of climate change
Historically, efforts to combat climate change were often hampered by what Mark Carney defined as the “Tragedy of the Horizon”: the impact of climate change was typically felt to be beyond the time horizon of most economic actors and policymakers, thus diminishing their urgency to act.[1]
However, we have reached a turning point and we cannot afford to delay any further, as the situation is changing rapidly, especially for Europe.
Global temperatures are rising faster than ever. The warmest years on record have been concentrated in the past decade, with 2023 being particularly extreme.[2]The accelerating pace of climate change is associated with an increase in the frequency of wildfires, periods of drought, heatwaves, and hurricanes and storms, all of which have contributed to growing environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.[3]
Europe is particularly affected by these changes. The European State of the Climate report 2023 indicates that Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world, warming at twice the global average rate since the 1980s.[4]From 1980 to 2022 weather and climate-related events resulted in economic losses totalling around €650 billion in the EU. Annual losses in 2022 were 41% higher than in 2009.[5]
This trend of rising temperatures and related damages is more problematic than ever. Our economies have not yet devised a way to properly allocate the risks of negative climate events to entities capable of dealing with them, as reflected in low insurance coverage. According to a joint report by the ECB and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), only a quarter of losses from extreme weather and climate events in the EU are insured.[6]Insurance coverage is even lower among the less affluent parts of the population, who tend to own housing that is more exposed to natural catastrophe risks and who, in relation to their income levels, face a higher cost of protection.[7]
Although it is leading the transformation at global level, and despite the considerable efforts made so far, the EU is currently not yet on track to meet its climate targets for 2030 and 2050.[8]Further action is needed.
The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which brings together central banks and supervisors working on climate issues around the world, has developed scenarios to assess how economies might look on different climate policy paths. These scenarios underline that to achieve the net zero target by 2050 the share of fossil fuels in the EU energy mix must be reduced from around 73% in 2020 to around 20% in 2050, However, current policies would only reduce it to slightly below 60% (Chart 1, panel a). Under current policies, we would fall well short of the net zero target in 2050. Even if all existing national pledges were fulfilled, there would still be a large gap (Chart 1, panel b).[9]
To put the scale of action required into context, consider the investment required to meet the EU’s green transition objectives. The European Commission has estimated that additional investment of €620 billion a year will be needed between 2023 and 2030 (Chart 2).[10]This amounts to 3.7% of the EU’s 2023 GDP. In addition to this, the EU will also need to invest in climate resilience to prepare for the effects of climate change that can no longer be avoided.[11]Global temperatures are indeed on a trajectory that is far above the Paris Agreement goals.[12]
We are therefore now at the next stage of the tragedy of the horizon. Since we did not invest enough in the past, when the impacts seemed far off, we are now confronted with higher costs in terms of both the impact climate change is having on our economy today and the investment required to mitigate future damage. And we are exposed to a vicious cycle, where the economy finds itself caught in a continuous loop of crisis management, which reduces the scope for making the necessary investments in the green transition.[13]
But we should make no mistake: delaying the transition would be more costly. Results from ECB economy-wide top-down stress test show that transition costs are lower than the long-term costs of unabated climate change.[14]
Implications for central banks
This situation has profound implications for central banks’ core task of preserving price stability.[15]
Let me mention a few of them.
First, evidence underscores how extreme weather, such as unusually hot summers, affects both the level of inflation and its volatility. For example, ECB research estimates that the extreme summer heat in 2022 increased food inflation in Europe by around 0.7 percentage points cumulatively over 12 months. These effects could be even more pronounced in the future, increasing to 1% in 2035 and to almost 2% in 2060 (Chart 3).[16]More broadly, climate change could increase the frequency of supply side shocks, which are more difficult to deal with, take longer to be reabsorbed and result in high losses in income and employment, as they push inflation up and economic growth down.
Second, a slow green transition increases the economic impact of these supply shocks.Europe paid a high price for its dependence on fossil fuels when Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine triggered a sharp rise in energy prices and a spike in inflation. Taken together, the increase in prices of energy and energy-sensitive goods and services contributed around 6 percentage points to euro area inflation at its peak above 10% in October 2022 (Chart 4). Greater availability of renewable energy would have reduced the magnitude of the shock.[17]
Third, beyond inflation, climate change and extreme weather events can also affect the capital stock and labour productivity.[19]For instance, studies have found that a 1°C increase in temperatures above 25°C reduces productivity by roughly 2%.[20]Climate change constrains potential output and productivity growth, thereby reducing the level at which GDP growth and real wage gains may become inflationary.It may also be difficult to anticipate the impact on the natural rate of interest, i.e. the real rate of interest that is neither expansionary nor contractionary, making it more difficult to conduct monetary policy. Increasing climate-related damages and uncertainty may reduce productivity growth, raise precautionary savings and therefore dampen the natural rate of interest, whereas investment and innovation stemming from transition policies could affect it positively.[21]
Fourth, if not correctly priced in, climate change implies financial risks for the central bank’s balance sheet. An accurate valuation of these risks is therefore key to protect the ECB’s balance sheet.[22]Likewise, banks’ balance sheets face similar financial risks, which upon materialisation may impact their soundness and thus the monetary policy transmission mechanism.[23]
The role of the ECB
So what can the ECB do within its mandate?
The ECB’s monetary policy decisions are guided by our primary objective, which is to pursue price stability, defined as a target of 2% inflation over the medium term. Without prejudice to this primary objective, the ECB and national central banks support the general economic policies in the European Union with a view to helping to achieve its objectives. This includes supporting the green transition of the economy in line with the EU’s climate objectives. We have both our primary objective and our secondary objective in mind when it comes to dealing with climate change.
By pursuing price stability, we are contributing to a stable and predictable macroeconomic environment. This is essential to generate the resources and incentives required for long-term planning and investment in the green transition.
This means that we must take the necessary action when inflation is deviating from our medium-term target. And that’s exactly what the ECB has done since July 2022, helping to bring inflation rapidly down from its peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.4% last month. Barring any further shocks, we expect inflation to fluctuate around current levels in the coming months before falling to our target next year. As supply shocks unwind, we can finally turn our attention to pursuing lower inflation and higher growth simultaneously. Recent data go in that direction and increase our confidence that we will be able to dial back our restrictive monetary policy stance. So although tighter financing conditions have temporarily increased the cost of borrowing, they have helped keep inflation expectations anchored, increased confidence that inflation will return to our target, and ultimately contributed to a lower cost of funding for long-term projects related to the green transition, which were also temporarily affected by higher borrowing costs.[24][25]
Price stability is crucial to helping us achieve net zero because it enables households and businesses to better detect relative price changes and to factor these into their decisions. As extensive changes in consumption patterns and production technologies are required to achieve the net zero scenario, price signals are critical when setting the right incentives for the green transition. For instance, the recent spike in energy prices contributed to a sustained reduction in energy consumption and the energy intensity of the European economy. The European Commission has estimated that demand for natural gas in the EU declined by 18% between August 2022 and March 2024, exceeding the 15% reduction target set after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Looking ahead, a key question for monetary policy is how to address the risk of more frequent supply shocks, the effects of which are magnified by climate change and insufficient progress on the green transition. On the one hand, central banks could consider reacting more quickly to large shocks, both when they occur and when they unwind, to preserve an appropriate monetary policy stance. On the other hand, central banks should avoid excessively tightening financing conditions to pre-empt any potential inflationary effects caused by shocks that have not yet materialised. This approach could be counterproductive because it reduces potential output and investments that could enhance our resilience to such shocks.
Beyond establishing the right framework conditions as part of our price stability mandate, we are factoring climate change into our tasks.
First, since the ECB strategy review of 2020-2021 we have been integrating climate considerations into our monetary policy framework.[26]InOctober 2022 we started tilting the reinvestments of our corporate bond holdings towards issuers with a better climate performance.[27]Moreover, climate-related financial risks are considered in regular reviews of collateral haircut schedules.[28]In 2023 we also started disclosing the climate impact of our corporate sector portfolio held for monetary and non-monetary policy purposes annually. We have committed to continuously improving our disclosures as the quality and availability of data improve, and to expanding the scope of these disclosures to our other monetary policy portfolios.[29]
Following the recent review of our operational framework, we decided to incorporate climate change-related considerations into our structural monetary policy operations.[30]Moreover, in the future we will only accept marketable assets and credit claims from companies and debtors that comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. And we intend to limit the share of assets issued by firms with a high carbon footprint in the collateral pools of counterparties once the necessary technical preconditions are in place.[31]
Second, we are taking action as part of our responsibility for supervising banks. In particular, we have taken measures to ensure that banks manage climate-related and environmental risks. While banks have made progress on this in recent years[32], more works lies ahead[33]. Banks also remain susceptible to greenwashing[34]and they still lend disproportionately to sectors with high exposure to climate-related risk and to high-emitting households.[35]
Third, we are taking measures to reduce the environmental footprint of banknotes and payment systems. For example, for banknotes, we use only 100% sustainable cotton and banned the disposal of banknote waste in landfill.[36]In the field of payment systems, we are considering environmental aspects in the design of a digital euro.
Fourth, we are seeking to reduce our organisation’s environmental footprint. Since 2010 the ECB has run a certified environmental management system covering its own operations. In the last ten years we reduced electricity and heating consumption per workplace by 30% and 49% respectively. Taking emission reduction targets as a reference, in 2021 the ECB committed to reducing its own operations’ footprint by 46.2% by 2030, taking 2019 as a baseline.
Finally, we play a key role through our research and analysis. Beyond their direct relevance to our tasks, our findings may also be useful for other policy areas supporting the green transition. For example, we contribute actively to the work of the NGFS and provide advice on financial legislation as foreseen under the Treaties.
We recently took stock of the progress we have made so far (Chart 5). The ECB’s new climate and nature plan 2024-2025 sets out our renewed commitment to take action, within our mandate, to support the green transition.[37]We will continue to implement measures that we have already agreed upon in the fields of macroeconomic analysis, monetary policy, banking supervision, climate-related data and our own corporate sustainability. In addition, the plan sets out three focus areas for 2024-25: navigating the transition to a green economy, addressing the increasing physical impact of climate change and advancing work on nature loss and degradation. These focus areas will guide our exploratory and analytical work in the coming years.
Complementarity with other policies
Notwithstanding these initiatives, it is important to emphasise that the primary responsibility for leading the green transition lies with elected governments, which possess more direct tools and the legislative power to enact the necessary changes. Since there are important complementarities between these policies and monetary policy, the ECB stands ready to offer support by providing technical analysis and advice. This knowledge sharing lies squarely within the scope of our primary mandate insofar as these other policies, by mitigating climate change risks, will allow monetary policy instruments to more effectively preserve price stability.
Let me provide some examples of these complementarities.
A first example is the complementarity with policies aimed at cushioning supply shocks.
In particular, policies that support diversification away from fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency enhance the resilience of our economy to shocks stemming from energy commodities prices, thereby containing inflationary pressures. Remarkable technological advances in recent years have greatly enhanced the efficacy and reduced the cost of sustainable technologies. Notably, the period from 2010 to 2022 saw dramatic decreases in the cost of producing electricity from offshore wind, onshore wind and solar energy by 60%, 70% and 90% respectively (Chart 6).
At the same time, efforts to secure the supply of key raw materials, jointly purchase them or support innovation to reduce dependency on them can help lessen our exposure to the price and availability of metals and minerals like copper or lithium that are critical for the green transition.
Likewise, measures to ease the impact on households and businesses of fossil fuel energy price spikes can be designed so as not to suppress the price signal, which is key for providing incentives to reduce consumption of and dependency on fossil fuels.[38]
Second, other policies can mitigate the negative impact of climate change on productivity and potential output.
The EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) is a key policy tool for supporting the green transition by effectively incentivising the private sector to adopt cleaner technologies and processes. This policy has not only contributed to a reduction in emissions but has also spurred innovation in green technologies.[39]
Policies that support innovation and the deployment of renewable energy technologies can also yield high returns. Notably, advancements in renewable energy sources, battery storage and smart grids are possibly reaching a tipping point: as these solutions become more widely adopted and developed, they encourage further deployment, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation and investment.[40]In this respect, it is worth recalling that the integration of the European energy market – by creating a genuine energy union – would allow us to reap benefits in terms of scale and diversification, leading to both increased efficiency and greater resilience.
This also matters for Europe’s competitiveness. As with digitalisation, the ability to offer the world-leading technologies, products and services needed for the green transition will decide tomorrow’s winners and losers in the global productivity race.
Third, let me emphasise the complementarity with macroeconomic policies that have the potential to generate useful resources for the green transition and to mobilise them effectively for this purpose.
The EU already dedicates a large share of its funding to green objectives. According to the European Commission, a total of €578 billion will be allocated to supporting climate action over the current budgetary period from 2021 to 2027, around 33.5% of the overall portfolio. The instrument set to make the largest contribution is the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which accounts for 35% of the overall climate action budget (Chart 7). But the RRF is a temporary tool. Once it is discontinued in 2026, the EU budget for the green transition will shrink significantly as a result of the cliff effect.[41]
Further efforts to mobilise fiscal resources at EU level may include some reprioritisation of the EU budget, an increase in the EU’s own resources, as well as the promotion of new joint debt issuance initiatives to fund investment in genuine European public goods – for instance energy grids and interconnections. We can and should learn from our experiences with existing instruments to design effective tools.[42]
But the bulk of the funding for the transition will have to come from private funding sources. In the euro area, banks will play an essential role in supporting investment and the adoption of green technologies by firms and households. However, a key EU policy objective is to further develop capital markets[43], which could provide specialised funding and support innovation.[44]
The market for green financial products has grown significantly in recent years,[45]but there is room for more progress. In a recent report on the future of the Single Market, Enrico Letta pointed to the need to better channel private savings into the green transition. He noted that there are approximately €33 trillion in private savings sitting in current accounts in the EU, which are therefore not being fully leveraged to meet investment needs.[46]
Better channelling these private funds could provide a substantial boost to the EU’s green investment goals. To achieve this, it is essential to make further progress on completing the capital markets union. In this respect, the EU could also explore the scope for measures that target green segments of capital markets.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the urgent need to combat climate change cannot be overstated. We should have acted yesterday, and we certainly cannot afford to wait until tomorrow.
Climate change is accelerating as we speak and it has important implications for central banks because it has an impact on inflation and the exposure to supply shocks, while lowering potential output and productivity growth. It also creates financial risks for the central bank’s balance sheet.
So we face two mutually exclusive paths: either we choose inaction and find ourselves trapped in a vicious cycle of constantly responding to escalating crises or we proactively seek to prevent the emergence of new climate and energy crises through sound and coordinated policies.
At the ECB, we are steadfast in our commitment to support the green transition within the scope of our mandate. However, this is not a task we can accomplish alone. It requires a collective effort by all stakeholders across Europe. In turn, we as central banks can benefit from these efforts in the pursuit of our objectives.
Specifically, the EU will need to implement robust supply side policies to move away from fossil fuels, enhance energy efficiency and ensure the availability of key raw materials. To transform our ambitions into tangible outcomes, substantial investments are necessary. By pooling resources across Europe and establishing a strong capital markets union, we can attract significant private capital – and direct it towards sustainable projects.
The path ahead is challenging, but Europe has a proven track record of rising to the occasion when it matters most.
Thank you."

Guest lecture by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Stanford Graduate School of Business
Stanford, 2 May 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to review the ECB’s monetary policy tightening cycle.[1]The tightening began in December 2021 with the announcement of the end date for our net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), as well as the recalibration and subsequent phase-out of our targeted lending programme. After concluding net purchases under the PEPP in March 2022 and net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) in June 2022, we subsequently normalised our policy rate (the deposit facility rate [DFR] in conditions of abundant excess liquidity) from -0.5 per cent to 2 per cent in the second half of 2022, before raising rates further into restrictive territory during the first nine months of 2023 to a level of 4.0 per cent. We have held the DFR constant at this level over the last five meetings since our last hike in September (Chart 1).[2]
This was an especially striking tightening campaign in view of the prevailing highly-accommodative monetary stance, which consisted of very low levels of the policy rate that had been in place over the last decade, the considerable net asset purchasing under the APP since 2015 and under the PEPP since 2020 and the scale and pricing of the targeted long-term refinancing operations. In late 2021, this stance was still expected to be maintained over the medium term: for instance, the median respondent in the December 2021 Survey of Monetary Analysts expected the deposit facility rate to remain in negative territory until the first quarter of 2025 and net purchases under the APP to continue until June 2023. It follows that, relativethe path expected in late 2021, the tightening cycle constituted a major surprise. Of course, the underlying driving force for the tightening cycle was the very large surprise increase in inflation, especially in 2022, after the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine. A defining feature is that a significant component of the stance tightening is expected to be persistent in nature, with rates only expected to descend to the neighbourhood of a more neutral level, while quantitative easing and targeted refinancing operations are not expected to be resumed.
The aim of this lecture is to review this tightening cycle from an analytical perspective. The tightening cycle had two basic aims. First, during an extended period in which inflation was far above our target, it was imperative to unwind a monetary stance that would have been too accommodative relative to the rapid shift in expected inflation over the relevant policy horizon. Second, given the scale of the surprise inflation in 2021-2022, it was essential to contain the propagation of the inflation shock through the subsequent price-wage adjustment phases. While corrective waves of price and wage resetting were inescapable, a monetary stance that ensured that demand would be dampened and that inflation would return to the target in a timely manner would be needed to ensure an orderly adjustment phase that did not risk embedding above-target inflation into longer-term inflation expectations.
In calibrating the speed and scale of monetary tightening in the context of the post-pandemic recovery and extraordinary surge in energy prices (including due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine), several considerations were paramount.
First, lags in monetary transmission were inevitable: it would take time for monetary policy to exert its full impact on inflation.
Second, the descent of inflation from its peak would be assisted by the reversal of some of the factors driving the inflation surge: the easing of supply bottlenecks; the likely expansion of energy supply and contraction in energy demand in response to the spectacular increases in oil and gas prices; and the gradual re-normalisation of the economy through the fading out of pandemic-related distortions in sectoral supply and demand patterns. That is, the calibration of monetary policy should take account the temporary nature of some of the shocks, while making sure that these temporary shocks would not convert into permanent inflation through the de-anchoring of inflation expectations.
Third, the calibration needed to allow for various types of uncertainty. Along one dimension, there was uncertainty about the intrinsic persistence of the inflation process. In addition to the standard uncertainty about the feedback dynamics by which price increases in one period would trigger subsequent price and wage increases in following periods, the scale of inflation during 2022 also led to shifts in behaviour, with firms switching to more frequent pricing resets. While this added to the intensity of inflation, it also held out the possibility that the overall adjustment process could be front-loaded.[3]Ultimately, the persistence of inflation would turn on the scale of de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which warranted close monitoring.
Along a second dimension, there was uncertainty about the strength of transmission of monetary policy in view of possible shifts in the economic, financial and monetary environment. First and foremost, the many years of low inflation and the strategic commitment by central banks to deliver the inflation target over the medium term provided a strong foundation for containing the inflation shock, compared to the costly de-anchoring dynamics observed in the 1970s. Compared to previous tightening cycles, it was also important to take into account trend shifts in: the sectoral composition of activity (which, among other things, can affect the overall degree of price rigidity in the economy, the interest sensitivity of demand and the overall sensitivity of activity levels to domestic demand); the state of the labour market; the scale of leverage among households and firms; the state of the banking system (which had been stabilised following regulatory reforms and intensified supervision with the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) in relation to capital levels, the risk profiles of loan books (including due to the beneficial impact of borrower-based macroprudential measures) and bond holdings, together with the risk profile of liability structures; and, finally, structural exposures to interest rate movements (with a substantial increase in the share of fixed-rate mortgages).[4]
In addition to trend shifts, the pandemic itself had resulted in lower leverage and more robust balance sheets, due to forced savings during the pandemic and the scale of fiscal transfers to households and firms. Furthermore, monetary tightening could be taking hold at the same time as a projected rebound in economic activity might protect employment levels, with firms holding onto workers in anticipation of post-pandemic normalisation. Working in the opposite direction, Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine had triggered a major increase in economic uncertainty, while the surge in imported energy prices constituted a major terms of trade shock that substantially reduced real incomes and purchasing power: these forces were independently likely to dampen consumption and investment for any given level of monetary restriction.
Along a third dimension, the nature of the monetary configuration also created uncertainty about the tightening process. After many years of expanding the central bank balance sheet (which had further accelerated during the pandemic), the required shift in the monetary stance called for an exit from net asset purchases and a pull back from the longer-term refinancing operations that had pumped liquidity into the banking system, in addition to the lifting of the policy rate. In the absence of historical benchmarks for this exit process, there was a wide range of views about the possible impact on the financial system. In addition, since both balance sheet normalisation and the lifting of policy rates were simultaneously proceeding at a global level, there was also uncertainty about the strength of international spillovers in the tightening process.[5]
A final uncertainty dimension related to the modelling of monetary policy. The ECB maintains a suite of macroeconomic models in order to provide robust underpinnings for forecasting and policy analysis.[6]The projected impact of shifts in monetary policy varies across these models, in line with differences in the specification of the economic and financial environment and, crucially, in the sensitivity of inflation expectations to policy actions.
Taken together, these various types of uncertainty underlined the importance of taking a data-dependent approach to the calibration of monetary policy that would take into account the evolving inflation outlook, the realised path for underlying inflation indicators and the incoming evidence on the strength of monetary policy transmission.
I will now provide an analytical review of the transmission of monetary policy tightening to: the financial and banking systems; the economy; and, finally, inflation. I will also briefly draw some lessons from the tightening period for the conduct of monetary policy during the next phase of the cycle.
Transmission to financial markets and the banking sector
Our policy rate hikes and the phasing out of asset purchases have been passed smoothly to money markets, risk-free rates, risk assets and lending rates by banks.[7]
The money market is the immediate locus in the transmission of monetary policy. Our key ECB interest rates have a direct impact on the rates prevailing in that market, while our balance sheet policies also play an important role. The transmission of the steep increase in our policy rates to unsecured money market rates has been smooth and complete. This is essential for a proper transmission as the euro short-term rate (€STR) and expectations about its future path form the basis of the entire euro area risk-free rate curve: the overnight index swap (OIS) rates. In the secured money market, rates saw some imperfect pass-through in late 2022 as the revaluation of bonds contributed to a temporary scarcity of collateral. Our measures (such as securities lending, cash collateral, and changed remuneration of government deposits) have helped to successfully restore full transmission in that part of the money market as well.
As we returned to our policy rates as the primary instruments for steering the monetary policy stance in 2022, the understanding in the market of how we decide the key ECB interest rates has become pivotal again. This understanding contributes to the formation of expectations of market participants about the future path of interest rates and thereby has an immediate impact on medium- to longer-term interest rates, which are particularly consequential for the economy. ECB staff analysis of euro area risk-free rates and inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates suggests that financial markets have rapidly internalised the ECB’s pattern of reaction to changes in the inflation outlook. As a result, the gradual upward shift of the €STR forward curve throughout the tightening cycle (Chart 1) was more than proportional to the upward shift in market-based measures of inflation compensation (Chart 2), bringing real interest rates in the euro area from deeply negative to firmly positive levels.
When annual HICP inflation stood at 5 per cent in December 2021, markets were still pricing in a steady return of inflation to 2 per cent by the end of 2022. The repeated upward surprises in inflation thereafter caused an upward repricing of risk-free rates and of measures of inflation compensation, yet without signs that markets were misrepresenting our reaction function or that they were expecting inflation to stay permanently high. In fact, the inflation path priced into measures of inflation compensation and ECB staff analysis that seeks to extract the genuine inflation expectations component indicate that longer-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored close to 2 per cent throughout this episode.
The continued anchoring of inflation expectations also helps explain another pattern in euro risk-free rates that has caused concerns among some observers: the slope of the risk-free curve – as measured by the difference between the OIS-ILS spread at a ten-year compared to two-year maturity – has been negative for over a year now and even stood at -0.8 in June 2023, a record-low level since the launch of the euro (Chart 3). Historically in the euro area and elsewhere, an inverted yield curve has often preceded economic recessions.[8]While the euro area economy has been stagnating, fears of a deep and long recession have proven unfounded. At the current juncture, the negative slope of the yield curve points to an assessment by markets which is directionally in line with ours: short-term interest rates stand at high and firmly restrictive levels but medium to longer-term rates are lower, as inflation and with it our policy rates are set to decline over time. In other words, the current inversion of the yield curve indicates expectations of an eventual normalisation of inflation towards 2 per cent and of interest rates towards more neutral levels.
Longer-term risk-free rates increased in the euro area not only on account of higher expected policy rates, but also due to other measures taken by us and central banks globally. In particular, the phasing out of asset purchases has had an additional tightening effect via the decompression of term premia. Since December 2021, more than one third of the 280 basis point increase in the ten-year euro area OIS rate is estimated by our staff to result from an increase in term premia stemming from quantitative tightening and other factors. Indeed, the ongoing reduction (both realised and expected) of the Eurosystem bond holdings has been the main driver behind the increase in sovereign risk premia – and, given the no-arbitrage condition, in risk-free term premia – as duration risk is added back into the market (Chart 4).
Our policy tightening has also been reflected in sovereign bond markets, which have coped well with the rapid increase in interest rates. Sovereign bonds serve as a key reference asset to price other bonds and as an important determinant of overall financial conditions within economies. ECB staff analysis also confirms that sovereign stress impairs the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and eventually to inflation. Looking at the euro area as a whole, GDP-weighted euro area sovereign bond yields have moved largely in lockstep with risk-free rates in recent years. As a result, the ten-year yield spread over the OIS rate has been fairly stable (Chart 5). While the increase in interest rates and the decline of the Eurosystem balance sheet have induced upward pressure on longer-term bond yields, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), including the in-built flexibility applied to reinvestments, and the transmission protection instrument (TPI) have been important elements in our monetary toolkit. It is plausible that the remarkably smooth transmission of the forceful tightening cycle to the sovereign bond market would not have been possible to the same extent without PEPP flexibility and the TPI. The EU-wide solidarity embodied in the NGEU programme has also played a vital role in reducing risk premia.
Finally, the exchange rate response has been relatively muted over the tightening cycle. The euro has remained broadly stable against the US dollar(Chart 6). This is largely due to the considerable degree of synchronicity of the tightening cycle.
The transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending conditions has evolved over the course of the tightening cycle. In general, the cost of funding for banks depends both on their sources of funding and the term structure of interest rates. Bank bond yields responded quickly to the tightening monetary policy (Chart 7). And while the pass-through from our policy rates to the average rates that banks apply to deposits has been partial and relatively slow, time deposit rates, especially those of firms, have tracked policy rate hikes rather closely (Chart 8).
One contributor to the asymmetry in the response of returns on different segments of bank funding to monetary policy was that banks had been reluctant to pass on negative interest rates to their retail depositors during the highly accommodative phase, driving a negative spread between the remuneration of customer deposits and the interest banks were receiving on reserves. As a corollary, banks were initially slow to raise deposit rates in order to restore traditional margins. In addition, the high amount of central bank liquidity and the low demand for credit also limited the pressure to increase deposit rates. Furthermore, a lack of competition in some member countries also reduced the pass through to deposit rates.
Over the period since September 2023 in which we have held our policy rates constant, bank bond yields have declined somewhat, in part reflecting the anticipation of future rate cuts, while deposit rates have continued to increase, as competition for deposits intensifies and depositors shift funds from lower remuneration overnight deposits towards more attractive time deposits.
Banks have passed on their increased funding costs to firms and, to a slightly lesser extent, households in mortgage lending (Chart 9). Interest rates on new lending increased rapidly, peaking soon after the last rate hike in September 2023, but have been edging down recently. However, average lending rates on the outstanding stock of loans have continued to increase. This reflects the ongoing transmission of past rate hikes, as loans that were granted in the past at lower rates reprice.
The annual growth rate of lending to firms and households declined sharply over the tightening cycle but is now also showing signs of stabilisation, albeit at low levels. According to the most recent bank lending survey (BLS), net demand for new bank loans by firms is still declining, as the high interest rate environment keeps external financing costs elevated and the weak growth environment means that firms are postponing fixed investment plans (Chart 10). At the same time, banks reported a modest net tightening of bank credit standards for loans to firms, mainly on account of increased risk perception (Chart 11)
Evidence from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) is consistent with the weakness in bank lending to firms (Chart 12 and Chart 13). Firms participating in SAFE have reported a continued deterioration in bank loan availability, although this has eased from previous rounds and firms do expect a small improvement in credit supply over the next three months. There has also been a sharp drop in the share of firms applying for a bank loan, a continuation of the trend that began late last year. At the same time, firms signalled less reliance on bank loans, which might reflect sufficient internal funds and/or easier access to non-bank external funding, together with the postponement of investment plans due to a slowing economy or expectations of lower interest rates later this year.
Turning to lending conditions to households, the BLS results point to tentative stabilisation in net demand for new loans to households, while credit standards on household mortgages eased for the first time in two years (Chart 14 and Chart 15). Taken together, the information from these surveys is consistent with persistently-weak credit demand and stabilisation in credit supply conditions to firms and households at tight levels.
In comparison to previous hiking cycles, the flow of credit to firms has declined more quickly since the start of our policy rate hikes (Chart 16). The decline in credit observed so far in the current cycle has been stronger than historical regularities would suggest, based on linear models. The particularly large and rapid increase in policy rates may have amplified the tightening impulse. This may have activated two specific amplification channels operating through bank and firm balance sheets. The first is a risk-taking channel, in which large policy rate hikes increase the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the capacity and willingness to lend.[9]The second is a signalling channel, through which rapid rate hikes might foreshadow a deterioration in future economic conditions, reducing the expected revenues and increasing the expected future funding costs of potential borrowers, leading them to reduce their demand for credit. Staff estimates suggest that the actual contraction in credit has been more in line with a path that incorporates such non-linear effects in transmission operating through bank and firm balance sheets (Chart 17).
The availability of liquidity to the banking system is also playing a role in the transmission to bank lending. Estimates by ECB staff suggest that banks with lower excess liquidity are more likely to reduce their supply of credit in response to policy rate hikes, and the increase in their lending rates is likely to be larger (Chart 18). This means that, as aggregate liquidity shrinks, the transmission of our restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending may strengthen.
Finally, institutional factors, such as banking supervision and macroprudential policies, play a significant role in shaping the risk-taking behaviour of banks. Both supranational and centralised bank supervision can reduce unwarranted risk taking by banks, while encouraging lending to better performing firms.[10]Sound macroprudential policies can also complement monetary policy by increasing the resilience of the financial system.[11]Such frameworks, which have been put in place over the past decade, have strengthened the banking sector, and allow for a more orderly transmission of monetary policy, thus reinforcing monetary policy's ability to fulfil its mandate of ensuring price stability.[12]
The restrictive policy stance has also been feeding through to economic activity.Economic activity has been stagnating throughout 2023 and started to recover at the beginning of 2024 (Chart 19). In terms of the demand components, public consumption has been the main consistent driver of growth, while private consumption and external demand have remained subdued in recent quarters. Weak housing investment has been a persistent drag on growth, while business investment has been more resilient until recently, as past order backlogs supported the production of capital goods (Chart 20).
Our restrictive policy stance has transmitted at different speeds to different parts of the economy. The speed and strength of transmission depends on several factors, including the importance of foreign demand and foreign competition, the reliance on domestic compared to global supply chains, the balance sheets of households and firms, the interest sensitivity of investment and consumption and the state of the labour market. Estimates suggest that the peak impact of our policy tightening on activity levels is larger for manufacturing than for services, with the peak impact occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023, and larger for business and housing investment than for private consumption, with the transmission to business investment strengthening further in the first quarter of 2024 (Chart 21).[13]
As the structure of the euro area economy evolves, such sectoral heterogeneity in monetary policy transmission may also alter the impact on aggregate economic activity. For instance, in view of the rising role of services in the euro area, and the slower and weaker response of services output to monetary policy, it is natural to ask whether transmission to the overall economy has become less powerful in terms of its impact on output. ECB staff analysis confirms that a higher services intensity dampens monetary policy transmission to economic activity, but this dampening effect is moderate: the observed increase in the services share of the euro area economy since the launch of the euro is estimated to have reduced the peak effect on output of a monetary policy interest rate increase by just around 10 per cent (Chart 22).[14]
Monetary policy tightening also has heterogeneous effects on different types of private consumption. For example, our staff estimate that spending on durable goods and luxury goods declines more than it does on non-durables, services, and necessity goods (Chart 23). Inflation is also found to adjust differently across essential and non-essential items.
The build-up of household excess savings and the aggregate strength of corporate balance sheets due to the restrictions on mobility and the significant fiscal transfers during the pandemic may have helped to cushion the impact of monetary policy during the early phase of the tightening. The robust labour market has also supported real income and consumption, in view of the sensitivity of household spending plans to the perceived risk of unemployment. The rotation back towards services, particularly contact-intensive and recreation and travel services following the post-pandemic reopening, was also an important driver of the drop in the savings rate in 2022 and 2023.[15]
Nevertheless, the sharp increase in inflation has eroded the real value of household and corporate deposits, while the jump in interest rates has generated losses on bond holdings and depressed house prices, thus weighing on financial and non-financial wealth.[16]Moreover, household excess savings accumulated over the pandemic are now concentrated mostly in illiquid assets held by wealthier households, which may not provide a significant boost to private consumption.[17]In addition, profit margins and retained earnings have declined markedly since the start of the hiking cycle and the net interest income earned by firms has fallen.[18]Finally, while consumer confidence has recovered from its extremely low levels in September 2022, which had been triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and surging energy prices, it is still low and well below its long-term average, weighing on spending even as real disposable incomes grow (Chart 24).[19]
As reflected in the March 2024 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, we expect growth to recover gradually over the course of this year. Output in the euro area returned to a positive growth rate in the first quarter of 2024 after five quarters of stagnation, while soft indicators, such as the composite PMI for the euro area, point to further positive growth rates in the quarters ahead (Chart 25).
The recovery might continue to be characterised by different speeds across sectors. However, as the impact of past monetary policy tightening starts reducing its intensity, the divergence between weak manufacturing and resilient services activity should gradually reduce. The recovery should be supported by declining inflation and further nominal wage growth, which boost real disposable incomes and consumer confidence. A gradual pickup in foreign demand is also expected to support the recovery. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time. In line with this, the March projections are also predicated on significant policy easing over the projection horizon (see also Chart 1). Respondents in the most recent survey of monetary analysts (SMA) expect a gradual recovery in GDP in the first half of this year, in line with the March projections, likely reflecting an anticipation of an of an easing in financing conditions.
We have already seen a substantial disinflation from the peak inflation rate of 10.6 per cent in October 2022 (Chart 26). Inflation had started to increase in early 2021 from the pandemic low point of -0.3 per cent in late 2020, rising above the two per cent medium-term target in July 2021, before continuing to climb throughout 2021 and most of 2022. Since late 2022, inflation has come down markedly and the March 2024 ECB staff projections see inflation stabilising around the 2 per cent target from about the middle of 2025 onwards.
In fact, inflation has declined more quickly than we had expected. For instance, inflation came in at 2.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, 0.6 and 0.8 percentage points below what was projected back in September 2023, respectively. Slightly further ahead, inflation is expected to continue to be close to our two per cent target. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to continue declining gradually over the projection horizon, also returning to two per cent in the second half of 2025. Market participants largely agree with this assessment, with the one-year forward inflation-linked swap (ILS) rate at around 2 per cent and the median respondent in the SMA expecting inflation to stabilise at around 2 per cent in the second half of 2025.
While overall, the strong disinflation over the past year largely reflects the unwinding in energy inflation (which, in turn, partly reflects large base effects), the easing of pipeline pressures and the relaxation of supply bottlenecks, monetary policy tightening has contributed to the disinflation process by dampening demand and anchoring medium-term inflation expectations at our two per cent target.
Inflation has continued to fall in recent months. According to the recent flash release, headline inflation remained stable in April at 2.4 per cent, while core inflation declined to 2.7 per cent from 2.9 per cent in March. Both services and goods inflation declined in April, while energy and unprocessed food inflation increased. Most measures of underlying inflation also continue to ease, although domestic price pressures remain strong (Chart 27).
Wage growth is moderating but remains elevated, with recently signed agreements pointing to a slowdown in wage growth to around 4 per cent for the remainder of the year (Chart 28). Firms are also telling us that they expect to raise prices less, with the one year ahead selling price expectations now hovering around 3 per cent, down from 6 per cent a year ago (Chart 29). They also expect slower wage growth over the coming year. This is consistent with evidence from the European Commission, which shows further declines in selling price expectations, which now stand around their mid-2021 levels for most sectors (Chart 30).
So, how has monetary policy contributed to the current disinflation? Monetary policy affects demand and prices through various channels, some that are more direct (via intertemporal substitution) and some that are more indirect (via growth and employment). This means that the full effect of changes in monetary policy on aggregate inflation comes with long and variable lags. In the next section, I will discuss some of the model-implied estimates of the impact that our policy tightening cycle has had on inflation so far, and the expected impacts over the medium-term. However, granular price analysis can also shed light on this question. As consumers rein in their spending in response to a monetary policy tightening, they start by consuming fewer goods with a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution, such as non-essential items and durables. They may also reduce spending on goods that are more interest-rate sensitive, such as durable goods purchased using credit. Analysis by staff suggests that the price response of items most sensitive to monetary policy shocks, which tend to include durables and non-essential items, is around three times larger than for less sensitive items (Chart 31). Finally, the price reaction to monetary policy shocks of these more sensitive consumer items has been stronger in the recent tightening cycle than is past episodes of monetary restraint, reflecting the effectiveness of the steep and decisive hiking policy in dampening demand.
Given the differential output impact of monetary policy across manufacturing and services that was discussed in the previous section, we may also expect a differential impact on sectoral inflation. Indeed, the share of items that are highly sensitive to monetary policy shocks is higher for goods than for non-tradable services, while inflation reacts less to monetary policy shocks in countries that are more intensive in services intermediates.[20]For example, if prices in the traded sector (predominantly capital intensive manufacturing) are largely exogenous and driven by world prices, then monetary policy may have larger output effects but small price effects. The inverse may be true in the non-traded sector (predominantly services) where the combination of imperfect competition and price rigidities may give rise to stronger price effects of monetary policy via the real economy. Pinning down these differences empirically can be challenging in light of the diverse composition of these two sectors and confluence of other (potentially countervailing) channels.
The next phase of the disinflation process is likely to be more gradual, with bumps in the road ahead. We expect headline inflation to decline more slowly than it has done so far, largely on account of positive base effects, including the expiration or retirement of fiscal measures taken in the past to dampen the surge in energy prices for consumers and firms (Chart 32).
A key role of monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large and persistent but temporary inflation shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through the de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Overall, longer-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored throughout the tightening cycle. The anchoring of longer-term expectations and the expectation that inflation would return to target in a timely manner has been supported by the speed and magnitude of the monetary policy response.
The expectations curve from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) has remained downward sloping throughout the inflation surge (which was also the case for consumers), meaning that the spike in inflation was not expected to persist and long-term expectations remained broadly stable (Chart 33). The right tail in the distribution of long-term inflation expectations in the SPF has diminished markedly compared with the peak inflation phase in late 2022 (Chart 34). The inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps has declined by about 40 basis points since last summer (Chart 35). We have also seen a decline in the inflation expectations at the medium-term horizon reported by firms and households from both the SAFE and CES results (Chart 36).
Counterfactual analysis
In this section, I report on some counterfactual model-based exercises conducted by ECB staff.
In providing a complete account of the role of monetary policy, it is simply not feasible in empirical studies to have full control over various confounding factors that contribute to output and inflation dynamics. Accordingly, one role for counterfactual analysis is to isolate the contribution of monetary policy tightening in the disinflation process. Estimates from our suite of macro models suggest that the monetary policy tightening that has cumulated since 2022 and is expected to continue to transmit through 2026 is detracting, on average, around 2 percentage points yearly from both GDP growth and inflation, relative to the counterfactual simulated path in the absence of policy action (Chart 37).[21]
In addition, these simulations suggest that, while the impact on GDP growth from our cumulative action might have reached its maximum level in 2023, the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead. In this quantitative model-based analysis, the calculation of the monetary policy impact abstracts from the role that the strong policy response to the surge in inflation has had in ensuring that inflation expectations have remained broadly anchored. That is, the policy impact would be even stronger if the models also assigned a role for monetary policy in maintaining the anchor.
Chart 38 illustrates a model-based exercise on the development of upside de-anchoring risks under the actual interest path during the hiking phase (blue bars) and a counterfactual analysis where the rate is assumed to have remained on the path underlying the December 2021 projections (yellow bars). De-anchoring is defined as a situation where medium-term inflation expectations deviate from the ECB’s 2 per cent inflation target. The analysis of the risks of de-anchoring are based on stochastic simulations around the projections of a regime-switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. In the anchored regime, the perceived inflation target is in line with the actual 2 per cent target. In contrast, in the de-anchored regime, inflation expectations are driven by past and current inflation realisations, even though the central bank continues to pursue the unchanged 2 per cent target.
Chart 38 shows that, due to the tightening of monetary policy, the credibility of the central bank has been maintained by containing upside de-anchoring risks. If rates had been kept at the level of December 2021, the risks would have increased considerably.
A second role for counterfactual analysis is to probe whether alternative tightening paths might have out-performed the tightening path we adopted. Chart 39 reports a set of alternative policy simulations, based on two macroeconomic models of the euro area (the MMR model and the NAWM-II model), which allow the derivation of policy rate paths that are conditionally optimal in the context of the models, given the different information sets available to policy makers regarding the path for inflation and the output gap at different points in time.[22]
The models suggest that, if the ECB had perfect foresight on the path that inflation and output would follow subsequently, we should have started hiking in the fourth quarter of 2021, raising the policy rate to between 4.5 and 6 per cent by mid-2023, depending on the model used (black dotted lines in Chart 39). Under this earlier and more aggressive tightening path, inflation would have peaked at around 7 per cent, roughly 3½ percentage points below the actual inflation peak in October 2022.
However, the associated output losses would have been severe. This result derives from the fact that the model attributes welfare losses to (squared) deviations of inflation from the target, output from potential, as well as interest rates from the equilibrium value. In that context, to some extent, the model finds it optimal to tolerate a large recession to reduce peak inflation. Along this line, the MMR model estimates that, to achieve this lower inflation profile, output would have needed to decline by 5 per cent below the baseline by the end of 2022, while the NAWM-II model shows that the economy would have needed to contract by 2 per cent in early 2022 and continue contracting for over a year.
Of course, the ECB did not have perfect foresight as to the future path of inflation and output: there were large forecast errors in 2021 and especially 2022, with a prominent role for the unexpected surge in energy prices and, relatedly, food prices.[23]Chart 39 also shows the updates to the model-based optimal policy paths that were triggered by the updates to the macroeconomic projections between December 2021 and December 2023, illustrating the high sensitivity of these paths to revised beliefs about the projected paths for inflation and output. In very broad terms, the revisions to the policy path followed by the ECB have been directionally similar to the revisions to such optimal policy paths.
It is also useful to expand the counterfactual analysis to take into account that the run-down of our securities portfolio has contributed to bringing inflation back to target. Optimal policy rate simulations in the MMR model show that our decisions regarding the securities portfolios and the associated change in expectations since the start of policy normalisation have been equivalent to an average of 30 basis points in rate increases between the first quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2026.[24]A similar analysis using the NAWM II model suggests that, compared to the case where the short-term interest rate is the sole policy instrument, an optimal policy mix, which considers changes to both the interest rate and the central bank balance sheet starting in the third quarter of Q3 2022, would have called for an unwinding of the central bank balance sheet by an additional 4 percentage points of GDP by the end of 2027, compared with expectations for the balance sheet path at the time, and a policy rate that is lower by around 10 basis points throughout the simulation horizon.[25]This optimal combination of policy instruments would have contributed towards marginally lower inflation and higher output, compared with the case where the short-term rate is the only available instrument.
A third role for counterfactual analysis is to examine the implications of uncertainty (as captured by alternative scenarios) for the conduct of monetary policy. In particular, since multiple dimensions of uncertainty are relevant, it is desirable to probe the robustness of monetary policy across a range of scenarios. For instance, taken in isolation, uncertainty about the persistence of inflation (for example, think of a scenario in which the feedback of wage inflation to price inflation could be stronger than expected) would call for a more aggressive monetary policy response to above-target inflation. However, also taken in isolation, uncertainty about the strength of monetary policy transmission would call for a more attenuated monetary policy response.
In order to think about the performance of a given monetary policy option across these different scenarios, it is useful to inspect model-based robustness exercises. Such counterfactual robustness exercises are routinely carried out by staff at the ECB. For instance, it is helpful to view the calculation of a “minimise maximum regret” criterion that minimises the worst-case welfare loss across various scenarios, with staff running simulations on the basis of a range of possible model-based loss functions that attaches weights to deviations of inflation from the target and deviations of output from potential output. When inflation is projected in the baseline to be not too far above the target, it turns out that “inflation persistence uncertainty” dominates only if the loss function puts zero weight on output losses, whereas “monetary transmission uncertainty” dominates if the loss function puts some weight on output losses. This is because the output losses under a more aggressive monetary policy response, if transmission turns out to be stronger and inflation declines more quickly than expected, outweigh the losses under a more attenuated monetary policy response if inflation turns out to be more persistent.[26]
Another type of robustness exercise is to examine the conduct of monetary policy under alternative modelling assumptions. For instance, as indicated earlier, it is evident that the large shocks in 2021 and especially 2022 triggered an increase in the frequency of price adjustment. Current work in progress by a team of economists from different central banks develop an optimal policy analysis that allows for a shift toward more frequent price changes in response to large shocks.[27]Under their approach, an increase in the frequency of price changes represents both an extra cost from high inflation (since there are economic costs – including management costs – from adjusting prices more frequently) but also an opportunity:  if price setters understand that the central bank is committed to returning inflation to the target in a timely manner through an aggressive interest rate response to the large shock, the phase of intense inflation will be shorter and the sacrifice ratio in terms of lost output will be lower since price setters only have to focus on adjusting prices to the cost shock rather than also having to incorporate an excessively-prolonged aftershock phase of second round effects. In turn, the anticipation of the monetary policy response helps to reduce the scale and duration of inflation response to the large shock.
Of course, while such model-based, staff-led robustness simulations help to provide some analytical underpinnings in reviewing policy options, many factors feed into the overall risk assessment of policymakers in making a rate decision. During the tightening cycle, the hierarchy of the various dimensions of uncertainty has shifted across different phases.
For instance, in the first half of 2022, uncertainty about the impact of the sharp shift in the expected path for the balance sheet with the end of net asset purchases (from a scale above€1 trillion in 2021) motivated a step-by-step approach to the phasing-out of quantitative easing, especially in the context of a similar shift by other central banks. The high economic damage envisaged in the alternative scenarios considered in March 2022 in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also motivated a gradual approach to the initial adjustment in the monetary stance in the first half of 2022. For instance, the optimal policy simulations in the MMR and NAWM-II models for the adverse downside scenario based on the escalation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine published with the March 2022 projections prescribed a less responsive policy path compared to the baseline.[28]
By the same token, the very sharp rise in actual and projected inflation in the course of 2022 put a premium on guarding against the de-anchoring of inflation expectations and motivated an accelerated approach to monetary tightening between July 2022 and March 2023, with the policy rate being raised by 350 basis points over six meetings. This acceleration took place in the context of a considerable decline in transmission tail risks in view of the observed smoothness of the exit from quantitative easing and the reassurance provided by the announcement of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in July 2022.
The March 2023 meeting also signalled a shift to a more granular approach to calibrating the level of restrictiveness, with the four subsequent meetings moving rates up in 25 basis point increments. Moving to a lower incremental pace reflected the reduction in inflation uncertainty (inflation had declined markedly from the October 2022 peak) and the increase in uncertainty about monetary policy transmission in view of the mounting evidence of a sharp slowdown in credit dynamics and in recognition of the time lags before the full impact of the accumulated hikes could be observed.
The final hike at the September 2023 meeting also incorporated risk management considerations. In particular, in view of some signs of an increase in inflation risks over the course of the summer, it was judged to be safer to increase the policy rate by a further 25 basis points to 4.0 per cent. This additional hike would reinforce progress towards the target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolved in line with the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation would return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path. In consequence, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.
The next phase: reducing the level of restriction
In line with our assessment at the April monetary policy meeting, this review of the tightening cycle, together with the observed disinflation path in recent months and the analysis of the drivers of inflation over the projection horizon, indicates that, based on the three elements of our reaction function we can conclude that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.
Subject to maintaining sufficient confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation to our target, the appropriate speed and scale of the reduction in the level of restriction will need to take into account several factors.[29]First, given the lags in transmission, the tightening effects from our past interest rate hikes are still unfolding. The simulations shown in Chart 37 suggest that, while the impact on GDP growth from our cumulative action might have reached its maximum level in 2023, the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead.
Second, as we continue along the disinflation path, the evolution of inflation expectations also has implications for the calibration of monetary policy restriction. As expectations of future inflation normalise further, leaving nominal rates unchanged implies a mechanical increase in real interest rates. For instance, if it were deemed appropriate to keep interest rates stable in real terms, nominal rates would need to decline in line with inflation expectations. In turn, this would reinforce the normalisation of inflation expectations and help to keep longer-term expectations of inflation well anchored at target.
Third, there are two-sided risks in proceeding through the next phase. In one direction, easing policy too soon or proceeding too quickly would not be consistent with inflation sustainably returning to target if inflation turns out to be more persistent than anticipated. In the other direction, keeping rates overly restrictive for too long could push inflation below target over the medium term and incur excessive side effects in terms of sacrificed output, employment and investment. This would require corrective action through a subsequent acceleration in rate cuts that could even require having to descend to below-neutral levels to fix any persistent drift towards a below-target inflation trend.
In navigating these risks, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. This approach has served us well in the tightening cycle and many of the same considerations will apply during the unwinding phase. In particular, we will have to balance the merits of forecast-based criteria that might call for front-loaded rate cuts versus data-dependent criteria that might call for a gradual and sequential approach, in view of the remaining uncertainty around the degree of persistence in inflation dynamics. Since the relative strengths of these opposing considerations are continuously evolving, a meeting-by-meeting approach maximises policy optionality.
A data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach is the best way to ensure that the calibration of monetary policy incorporates the multiple dimensions of uncertainty that have been highlighted in this lecture. Each quarterly projection meeting provides comprehensive staff updates on the inflation outlook, underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. In turn, while the staff projections are based on the market yield curve, the information at the quarterly meetings provides the foundations for an array of simulations of possible future rate paths, including optimal policy exercises as shown in Chart 39 and “robust” paths that seek to minimise the risk of a policy error across a range of plausible scenarios.
While this family of possible future rate paths provides helpful guidance to the Governing Council, the robust approach to making rate decisions under conditions of high uncertainty is to avoid pre-commitments or creating unwarranted expectations about the future rate path. In particular, moving from one meeting to the next meeting and from one projection round to the next projection round allows for the accumulation of further data that can help inform the rate decision.
For instance, the net interpretation of the incoming data at a non-projection meeting can result in several possible outcomes: (i) the confirmation of the quarterly assessment; (ii) a further boost to the level of confidence in the sustainability of convergence to the target and/or increased evidence of adverse economic side effects from the level of restriction; (iii) a decline in the level of confidence in the sustainability of convergence to the target and/or increased evidence of economic resilience despite the level of restriction. These outcomes differ markedly in terms of the implications for a rate decision at a non-projection meeting. Accordingly, it is best not to commit to a pre-set path for rate decisions and preserve optionality.
Conclusion
To conclude, the tightening cycle has ensured that the disinflation process has not been derailed by the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, with the sustainable return of inflation to our target underpinned by a dampened-demand environment. We consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path."

Introductory remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at a Euro 50 Group meeting
London, 29 April 2024
As regards inflation in the euro area, we have come a long way, but there is still work to be done. Nevertheless, we are heading in the right direction. After peaking at more than 10% in October 2022, headline inflation fell to 2.4% in March this year. Core inflation has also come down substantially from its peak 12 months ago of almost 6%. In March 2024 it stood below 3% for the first time in two years. In addition, most measures of underlying inflation declined further in February, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures. The impact of previous adverse supply shocks continues to fade and tight monetary policy is weighing on demand.
Mirroring the disconnect between manufacturing and services activity, goods and services inflation have diverged. Goods inflation dropped to 1.1% in March after almost reaching 7% in early 2023. Services inflation has also eased substantially from its peak level of close to 6% in July 2023. However, its decline has stalled since the second half of last year and it has remained at 4% for the last five months of available data.
Although inflation dynamics are broadly heading in the right direction, our work is not yet done. We expect inflation to fluctuate around current levels in the coming months. In particular, the swings in energy prices during 2023 and the associated base effects in calculating annual comparisons mechanically imply a bumpy path in the monthly readings for inflation rates over the remainder of 2024. In addition, the withdrawal of various temporary fiscal support measures will affect prices in an uneven manner.
Looking through these shorter-term fluctuations, a key factor we need to monitor is whether underlying inflation continues to ease. This applies in particular to our measure of domestic price pressures, which reflects the interplay between wages, productivity growth and profit margins. Wage growth based on national accounts data is showing signs of easing, potentially at a faster pace than we previously expected. But high employment growth, coupled with subdued output growth, continues to weigh on labour productivity. We have not seen improvements in productivity per employee or per hour worked. As a result, unit labour costs are still increasing. Looking ahead, we expect productivity to recover as activity strengthens. Turning to profits, restrictive monetary policy is reducing firms’ pricing power and weighing on unit profits, which is slowing the pass-through of wages to prices. In fact, unit profit growth fell to 2.5% in the last quarter of 2023, down from a peak of more than 9% in the last quarter of 2022.
While we expect inflation to return to our 2% target next year, the outlook is surrounded by substantial risks. The geopolitical situation, especially in the Middle East, poses a particular upside risk to inflation. While growing tensions in the region initially triggered only moderate movements in oil prices, recent developments remind us that monitoring such risks and their impact on commodity prices remains highly relevant for our inflation outlook. Should tensions in the region escalate further, major trading disruptions and impediments to oil supplies could push up energy prices and freight costs in the near term, disrupting global trade. Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increase more than expected or if profit margins prove to be more resilient. By contrast, a stronger-than-expected dampening impact of monetary policy on demand or an unexpected worsening of the economic environment in the rest of the world may result in downside surprises in inflation.
Growth is expected to resume at a moderate pace. The latest economic indicators suggest that activity is gradually recovering after a period of stagnation. But there are notable differences across sectors. Production in manufacturing continues to put a drag on activity. In the first two months of 2024 industrial production was still 1.5% below the average level in the final quarter of 2023.
By contrast, services activity offers a silver lining, as it is likely to have picked up again since the turn of the year. Services production rose by 1.5% in January, which is the highest reading since May 2023. Survey information confirms the diverging paths between manufacturing and services. The manufacturing output Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)has remained well in contractionary territory for some time while the PMI for services has been improving since October last year, returning to expansionary territory in the first quarter of 2024.
Although we will have to wait and see to what extent the encouraging signs of a pick-up in the services sector will be reflected in the hard data for the first quarter of the year, they do lend support to the assessment we provided in our March projections. ECB staff currently see economic activity remaining subdued in the near term before gradually recovering over the course of the year.
Consumer spending should strengthen as real disposable income continues to recover. Employment continued to grow in the final quarter of 2023, driven mainly by an increase in the labour force. In February the unemployment rate remained at 6.5%, its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. Barring further shocks, exports are also expected to recover amid improving global demand and a gradual rebalancing of consumption from services back to goods.
However, risks to our growth outlook remain elevated and tilted to the downside. In particular, geopolitical risks pose a threat to the world economy. If these risks were to materialise, specifically in the light of tensions in the Middle East, major trading routes could be blocked and global supply-side bottlenecks could worsen. A further slowdown in global trade would ultimately also weigh on euro area growth.
Financial stability
Weaker growth could pose challenges to the overall positive outlook for financial stability in the euro area, while rising geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty could raise the likelihood of tail events. We assess the outlook as fragile. While risk pricing in financial markets has generally been characterised by low volatility, market sentiment remains vulnerable to sudden shifts in response to negative surprises. Structurally low liquidity buffers combined with high leverage in segments of the non-bank financial sector could further amplify any market correction.
Real estate markets have remained in focus. While residential real estate markets have seen an orderly cooling, commercial real estate markets have faced more challenges – as tighter financing costs, a move towards hybrid working practices, e-commerce and environmental, social and governance requirements are likely to continue to put pressure notably on the office and retail segments. Mild signs of asset quality deterioration are becoming visible in commercial real estate (CRE) lending. That said, banks’ exposures are broadly contained. The same cannot be said for parts of the non-bank financial sector, which are less transparent and subject to lighter regulation.
But all in all, the euro area financial system has remained strong, supported by declining inflation. Firms and households have shown resilience in the face of rising debt servicing costs resulting from higher interest rates. Banks have maintained sound liquidity and capital buffers, while non-performing loan ratios remain close to historically low levels.
The ECB Governing Council has responded forcefully to the largest inflation surge on record in the euro area. We raised our key policy rates by a cumulative 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023 and have kept them at the current restrictive levels since then. At our recent April monetary policy meeting, we considered that the current level of key ECB interest rates is contributing substantially to the ongoing disinflation process. We remain determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, we will dial back the level of monetary policy restriction. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB conference on “An innovative and integrated European retail payments market”
Frankfurt, 24 April 2024
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to this conference today.
The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) was launched in 2002, aiming to address the fragmentation in non-cash payments that prevailed at the time. Payments between euro area countries were slower, more cumbersome and more expensive than domestic payments. And yet, many market participants questioned the merits of the project: will SEPA make payment services more efficient? Will it make the economy more competitive? And will it deliver real benefits to customers?
Fast-forward to today and it is clear that the initial scepticism was unfounded. We no longer differentiate between national and cross-border payments in euro for credit transfers and direct debits[1]. And people really appreciate the benefits of these two payment services for seamless money transfers across Europe.
However, SEPA has fallen short when it comes to digital payments that are even more central to our daily lives: there is no SEPA at the point of interaction, namely for in-store, mobile or e-commerce payments. Person-to-person (P2P) solutions also remain fragmented.
Most European retail payment solutions are focused on national markets, covering only some use cases and lacking pan-European reach. Because of this fragmentation, cross-border transactions within the euro area have become dependent on a very small number of non-European market players. This hampers competition, innovation and resilience. Moreover, the digitalisation of payments is undermining the crucial role cash plays in financial inclusion. After all, it is the only means of payment that has legal tender status and can be used by anyone, anywhere in the euro area, free of charge.
As a result, we are once again at a crossroads. And just like in the past, the added value of taking SEPA to the next level is now being questioned: do wereallyneed a Single Euro Payments Area at the point of interaction? Do wereallyneed a digital euro?
The answer, much like two decades ago, is an unequivocal yes. We cannot afford to settle for the status quo. And we should ask ourselves some hard questions: why aren’t European retail payment solutions and platforms able to compete at the global level? Today, the market capitalisation of the largest European bank is several times lower than that of the dominant international card schemes. European payment solutions struggle to compete with these non-European payment providers even within Europe, while in the United States new retail payments companies succeed in scaling up rapidly.[2]
In my remarks today, I will argue that this has to do with the difficulty European payment service providers (PSPs) have in reaching pan-European scale. And I will advocate a comprehensive vision encompassing both public and private retail payments. Our goal is clear: to further integrate European payments with a view to supporting competition and innovation, while reducing excessive dependencies. Payments offer significant scope to deepen the Single Market in the interest of users and to enhance the competitiveness of European financial services.[3]
To emulate the success we had with the launch of the SEPA project, we need to resist the temptation to preserve the status quo. Instead, we must act, relying on the combined knowledge, expertise and efforts of both public authorities and private intermediaries to achieve a single area for retail payments in euro. The benefits in the medium and long run will be much greater than the initial investment costs.
The ECB is today calling on the payments industry to redouble its efforts.
Retail payments remain fragmented and dominated by a few non-European players
Despite the integration of the euro retail payments market over the past 15 years[4], today’s ecosystem is facing three major challenges.
First, European payment solutions remain fragmented along national lines.
Currently, European solutions for payments at the point of interaction, whether in physical shops, mobile or e-commerce, are scarce and mostly confined within national borders.[5]And we do not have a European digital solution for P2P payments covering the entire euro area. Instead of joining forces and sharing resources to develop pan-European solutions, national communities have often preferred to preserve the legacy of investments made in the past.
Consequently, citizens who live, work, travel or shop online in another euro area country find themselves reliant on very few, non-European solutions. And small companies that consider expanding their business across borders or online may be more reluctant to do so given the need to rely on those solutions and bear the associated costs.
We are thus in a paradoxical situation: the fragmentation of European payment solutions along national lines stands in the way of deepening the Single Market and further digitalising the economy. But efforts to reduce barriers to trade and accelerate digitalisation within the EU generate additional revenue for the few non-European players that currently make it possible to pay in shops and online across Europe, entrenching their dominant position. Some of the benefits of digitalisation and market integration are thus at risk of not reaching European consumers and instead growing the rents of non-European players.
Second, the failure of European payment solutions to achieve pan-European scale, and often to even go beyond their domestic market, has resulted in limited competition at the point of interaction.
This issue is particularly pronounced for card payments, which, in terms of value, now account for the majority of retail payment transactions.[6]Their share in the total number of digital transactions has also been increasing, while that of credit transfers and direct debits has receded (Chart 1).
According to the most recent data, international card schemes account for close to two-thirds (64%) of all electronically initiated transactions with cards issued in the euro area.[7]And 13 out of the 20 euro area countries rely on them entirely due to the absence of a national card scheme (Figure 1). The share of international card schemes is likely to grow further[8], as even the largest domestic card schemes are losing market share[9]. The latter should be wary of this development: while for the time being they maintain a steady revenue stream as card transaction values and volumes increase, this may well change once the market matures.
Competition is also hampered by barriers to entry, which hinder the emergence of new competitors. For instance, in the case of contactless transactions, which are rapidly becoming the new norm in card payments, potential new entrants face the challenge of costly and time-consuming terminal updates. The lack of a widely available European open near-field communication (NFC) kernel further compounds this issue, forcing new entrants who want to offer contactless payments with mobile devices in stores to either abandon their efforts or depend on existing kernels provided by competitors.
Limited competition in card payments translates into higher fees. According to a recent study by the European Commission, the average net merchant service charges applied by card schemes in the EU almost doubled between 2018 and 2022 (from 0.27% to 0.44%)[10], resulting in significant additional costs for merchants.[11]When those are passed on to consumers, the effect is similar to a consumption tax, albeit one that does not benefit European governments. Furthermore, European merchants criticise the complexity and opacity of card scheme fees, which make it difficult to understand why they are charged so much.
The lack of competition is a problem in other segments, too, such as e-commerce, mobile and P2P payments. While some national initiatives have seen success in specific use cases[12], they fall short when competing with global players on a pan-European scale.
Moreover, big techs entering payments creates further risks, as they could leverage their dominant positions in neighbouring markets and their closed ecosystems. For instance, Apple’s significant market power in smart mobile devices and its dominant position in mobile wallet markets on the iOS operating system have raised concerns about anticompetitive behaviour.[13]It led to the opening of a formal antitrust investigation in connection with Apple Pay, the only mobile wallet solution that Apple allows to access the NFC antenna on iOS devices.[14]
The dependence on non-European players is the third major challenge for euro area retail payments. Openness to global competition is essential for fostering innovation. But without a genuine pan-European alternative to international card schemes, payments are more expensive for consumers and merchants. And an overreliance on non-European providers makes our payments and financial system more vulnerable to external disruptions. European alternatives would improve the resilience of the euro area and the Single Market to such disruptions. And it would increase Europe’s ability to set its own standards, rather than depending on standards established elsewhere.
Europeans should have more control over an asset as crucial to our economy and society as payments.
The Eurosystem’s response: our retail payments strategy and digital euro project
To tackle these challenges effectively, we must take decisive action to move away from the status quo. And I would like to thank Commissioner McGuinness and the European Commission as a whole for their continuous support and legislative ambition in this regard.
At the ECB we envisage a future where retail payments are faster, cheaper, easier and more resilient, thanks to a diversity of pan-European means of payment using European infrastructure. And we do not want this to happen ten years from now, but much sooner. An old proverb says: “the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second-best time is now”. Digitalisation and geopolitics are not standing still. This is why our strategy aims at fostering integration, innovation and independence, all for the benefit of users.
Our proposal encompasses two complementary transformation policies, mirroring the dual pillars of the financial system: public money and private money. These policies are not contradictory by nature; rather, they complement each other and enhance the overall functioning of the European retail payment system.
On the public money side, the Eurosystem maintains a steadfast commitment to issuing cash. Our pledge[15]is to ensure that cash remains widely available and accepted as both a means of payment and a store of value. Therefore, the ECB strongly supports[16]the establishment of rules on the legal tender status of euro banknotes and coins across the euro area.
Banknotes have played a crucial role in integrating payments within the euro area for over two decades, by providing a simple and universally accepted payment method. As we transition into the digital age, it is imperative that we preserve the same level of integration and ensure that our currency remains future-proof. There is no reason why public money should not go digital in keeping with all the other forms of payment. We need to adapt to evolving consumer preferences, which are increasingly digital. So the status quo is no longer a viable option.
This is why we have launched the digital euro project, currently in its preparatory phase.[17]A digital form of cash holds the promise of preserving the pivotal role of central bank money (Figure 2).
First and foremost, a digital euro would provide unparalleled pan-European reach, ensuring that payments can be conducted seamlessly anytime, anywhere within the euro area, for all types of digital payments (Table 1).
Moreover, as a public good, a digital euro would be provided to citizens free of charge for basic use. Crucially, a digital euro would uphold stringent privacy and inclusion standards, safeguarding user data and rights in the digital age.
Furthermore, a digital euro caters to a diverse range of payment scenarios, covering everything from online transactions to in-store purchases and P2P payments, both online and offline. The offline digital euro will provide a level of privacy very close to cash, while also contributing to resilience and inclusion.
Unlike existing payment methods, a digital euro would offer a comprehensive solution that aims to meet all – rather than just a few – of the evolving needs of modern consumers. Besides covering point-of-sale, e-commerce and P2P payments across the euro area, it would offer seamlessly integrated online and offline functionalities, ensuring that transactions would not be interrupted − even in a situation of limited network coverage or a power outage. No existing payment method offers all these benefits at once.
Finally, the digital euro will leave no one behind. Promoting digital financial inclusion is a fundamental principle underlying the concept of a digital euro, as also reflected in the relevant draft regulation.[18]
The Eurosystem is thus committed to offering a digital euro app in an inclusive and accessible way for people with low digital and financial skills and resources, as well as those with disabilities or functional limitations and the elderly. While private intermediaries will be able to integrate digital euro services into their own banking apps and wallets, a digital euro app offered by the Eurosystem would not only support accessibility – a feature that is important to consumers[19]– but also ensure that public money remains tangible for people by ensuring a harmonised, baseline user experience across the euro area. It would be made available in at least all official languages of the EU and be designed such that everybody will immediately recognise the digital euro, just as everybody can recognise euro banknotes today. And smaller PSPs that lack the resources to develop their own front-end solutions would be able to distribute digital euro services through the digital euro app. This app is thus essential for achieving the objectives of the digital euro.
At the same time, the app offered by the Eurosystem would not impinge on the relationship between PSPs and their customers: it would merely provide a uniform point of entry allowing users to interact with their PSP via a smartphone, for example to display information or initiate payments.[20]Moreover, PSPs will be free to provide customised value-added services in their own apps and wallets, going beyond the basic payment functionalities supported by the digital euro app.
While the digital euro complements private solutions by giving citizens an additional option for digital payments, it alone cannot resolve all the challenges facing European payments today and in the future.
That’s why our vision on payments entails a strategy[21]centred on fostering the development ofprivatelyoperated, European-governed, pan-European payment solutions at the point of interaction.
The Eurosystem supports market-led initiatives that meet a set of requirements it has defined for a European solution at the point of interaction.[22]The ECB therefore welcomed the European Payments Initiative (EPI), which has recently made further significant progress towards a European-grown instant payment solution, including the establishment of EPI Company, development of its brand, completion of acquisitions[23], and the pilot of instant P2P transactions. The ECB encourages EPI to continue its progress and to expand its geographical coverage to achieve pan-European reach.
Furthermore, the ECB views initiatives by mobile payment solutions and third-party providers favourably, recognising that they may enhance competition at the point of interaction. For instance, a recent collaboration involving three national mobile payment solutions[24]seeks to achieve interoperability in P2P transactions as a first step − and potentially also interoperability at the point of interaction in the coming years. Interoperability could be viewed as an intermediate step towards merging into a single payment solution.
While these European initiatives demonstrate market vitality, we need to avoid fragmentation. The division of consumers and merchants along geographical lines – with national communities joining solutions that cover only parts of the euro area – runs counter to the Eurosystem’s vision ofpan-Europeanreach. This fragmentation would also prevent payment solutions from taking advantage of the sheer scale of the Single Market.
So how can we avoid this undesired outcome and move towards a win-win situation for all payment providers?
One solution is to further develop the interoperability between conceptually different solutions. But we would need to see that this approach generates sufficient resources to sustain a common governance, shared functions and product innovation. Furthermore, some countries have national solutions with low market shares while others have none at all.
Therefore, while working to make progress on their current plans, private initiatives and national communities could consider joining forces to create strong integrated solutions and aim for pan-European reach within a reasonably short time horizon. Although this has not materialised so far, it could be short-sighted to stick to positions taken in the past rather than grasp the opportunities offered by a landscape in transformation.
The public sector can facilitate such initiatives to reach pan-European scale. In particular, the digital euro could play a key role in shaping open standards. This could allow intermediaries to optimise their implementation strategies and unlock both technological and monetary benefits.
To ensure a seamless implementation of the digital euro and a consistent payment experience across the euro area, the Eurosystem is actively working on a digital euro rulebook. This rulebook will implement common standards in the EU acceptance network. It will be designed to leverage existing standards while also preserving ample flexibility for the market to innovate and develop additional solutions.[25]
The digital euro rulebook, along with a robust infrastructure provided by the Eurosystem, would allow private providers to reach pan-European scale with their own payment solutions, achieving cost efficiencies and contributing to an integrated European payment market. This infrastructure would serve as a catalyst for innovation, enabling the development of new value-added services tailored to customers' needs emerging in the digital age. We envision the digital euro infrastructure as being like a unified European railway network, where various companies can operate their own trains delivering additional services to their customers.
Imagine the following possibilities: innovative front-end solutions designed for conditional payments, functionalities enabling effortless bill-splitting among friends and family, or micropayment applications making it easier to buy online content and services. These innovations could enhance the overall user experience, enable new business models and drive greater convenience in our day-to-day transactions.
Some of these innovative and value-added services are already present in some countries, but it is very expensive for the providers to expand their services across the entire euro area. On the one hand, the possibility to leverage the open digital euro infrastructure would ensure the necessary standardisation, the lack of which currently hinders innovation; on the other, it would enable private retail payment solutions to launch new products and functionalities immediately on a broader scale. This would give users access to a wider array of services and result in greater competition and innovation on a continental scale. It would also mitigate our current dependence on a few non-European providers.
For example, an open digital euro infrastructure would allow a Belgian citizen to open an account with a payment service provider in Spain that may offer services not yet available on the Belgian market. And new services could be developed such as automatic refunds when rail journeys or flights are delayed.
In addition, private sector players could also review and enrich the portfolio of their payments products in private money, providing customers with new options like rewards, bonuses and subscriptions. Or they could explore the cross-selling of core business products. Also, the competitive rush towards the use of friendly and secure technologies could improve customer experience.
But our retail payments strategy extends beyond the point of interaction. The second major goal of the Eurosystem’ strategy is to strengthen the “classic SEPA” framework, which provides the backbone for innovative European payments. SEPA has been a joint undertaking since the beginning. Both private and public clearing and settlement mechanisms have contributed to pan-European reach and resilience.
A key priority within this framework is the full deployment of instant payments. However, their roll-out has so far not enabled users to take full advantage of the important benefits that instant payments could generate. For instance, instant payments give consumers a clearer picture of their finances. And for businesses, they reduce the amount of money locked in processing, allowing for better cash and liquidity management and reducing the need for overdraft facilities. Instant payments can also trigger faster deliveries and real-time reconciliation of payments, as well as increasing the digitalisation of corporate supply chains. The ECB welcomes the recent regulation on instant payments[26], which aims to address obstacles such as the fragmented adherence of PSPs to the scheme and limiting transaction fees for payers.
Additionally, ongoing initiatives such as the SEPA Payment Account Access (SPAA) scheme contribute to enhancing independence and innovation. The scheme leverages “open banking” principles in payments. For a fee, participants can exchange data related to payment accounts and initiate payment transactions with premium features. SPAA-based payment solutions can provide a variety of account-to-account payment options as an alternative to cards at the point of interaction. The ECB welcomes this innovative European road to “open banking” and encourages market players to join the scheme.
However, the effectiveness of new schemes can sometimes fall short of expectations. For instance, PSPs implement proprietary solutions instead of using the newly designed SEPA schemes. Or key users discard core features of the instant payments scheme intended to offer functionalities equal to or better than those of traditional cards.
Beyond these particular cases, clarifying the reasons for such shortcomings may be worthwhile. The Eurosystem stands ready to help reflect on how to improve payment-related schemes.
Preparing for the transformation
Addressing these challenges and fulfilling our common vision for the future of retail payments requires industry readiness. The oft-voiced argument that resources are constrained points to the need for a shift in perspective. While past resource allocations may seem entrenched, we are entering a new phase in payments that demands additional efforts, re-allocation of resources and proper planning from industry stakeholders.
Moreover, confining these investments to national level is neither efficient nor sustainable, especially in the light of the significant influence wielded by non-EU players in the digital landscape. Opting for joint EU investments and leveraging economies of scale would enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our common efforts. And aligning these investments with the introduction of the digital euro would further maximise outcomes.
But it is crucial to recognise that this is not solely about costs. Just as SEPA facilitated the adoption of new standards and honed skills in the payments sector, the integration of private and public solutions at the point of interaction can foster innovation and resilience, and benefit the economy.
Conclusion
Let me conclude. Innovative, integrated and independent retail payments are crucial components of our monetary system.
Indeed, as Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa cautioned over two decades ago, “Public confidence in the currency could be endangered if retail payment [instruments and] systems were inefficient, impractical for users or unsafe.”[27]
The efforts made since then including the establishment of SEPA and the widespread acceptance of cash as a universally accepted payment method, were crucial for achieving a higher level of integration and efficiency in European retail payments.
However, we now stand at a crossroads as payments transition into the digital era, with the risk of crowding out public money, and European providers fail to be competitive on a pan-European, let alone global, scale.
To address these challenges, we have set up two transformation strategies: the digital euro and the retail payments strategy, the latter focusing on private pan-European payment solutions at the point of interaction. The digital euro will not only give European citizens more freedom of choice and the ability to pay with a secure solution that is widely accepted throughout the entire euro area. It will also establish a common infrastructure with pan-European reach, on which private intermediaries can build to offer competitive and innovative private payment solutions across Europe.
Today we need to take SEPA to the next level, at the point of interaction, through the digital euro and private pan-European payment solutions. Public-private cooperation can achieve greater integration, innovation and independence in payments, to the benefit of consumers and payment service providers. Together we can recapture the original spirit of SEPA.
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at Yale University in New Haven, USA
New Haven, USA, 22 April 2024
It is a pleasure to be here.
The Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs attracts some of the sharpest minds of each generation, shaping their talent and inspiring them to pursue exceptional careers in diplomacy and public policy.
And there is plenty to be inspired by while studying at Yale. Not too far from here, tucked away in the Sterling Memorial Library in the heart of Yale’s campus, lie the papers of America’s first diplomat, Benjamin Franklin.
Franklin was many things – ambassador to France, scientist, inventor, writer and publisher, to name a few – but above all, he was a man of ideas. As a young man, around the same age as some of you here, Franklin understood the power of ideas.
“All our ideas are first admitted by the senses and imprinted on the brain, increasing in number by observation and experience,” he wrote. “There they become the subjects of the soul’s action.”[1]
By inspiring action, ideas can help us grow. This might be personal growth – a student’s learning, say, allowing them to make the right decisions throughout their future career. But it holds at the societal level too: ideas help push our economies forward.
In recent decades, we had few barriers globally to the flow of ideas. Advanced economies shared their technologies with emerging ones, and emerging economies shared their cheaper input costs with us – the process we knew as “globalisation”.
But in recent years, the global economic order as we know it has been changing.
We now see that previously emerging economies are taking leadership in some advanced technologies. And we are seeing globalisation go into reverse, threatening access to the resources on which advanced technologies depend.
So, how do we all prosper in this new world?
I will argue today that the key ingredient for our prosperity remains the same as ever: generating and sharing new ideas.
But history tells us that ideas can only drive growth if we first create the right conditions that allow them to reach their full potential – and if we are committed to breaking the bottlenecks that stand in their way.
This is the challenge we all face today to thrive in this new world. And today, I will focus on what this challenge means for our economies and, in particular, for Europe.
The power of ideas across history
The history of human progress has been defined by technological breakthroughs generated by ideas. But ideas do not immediately translate into economic prosperity.
Take Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press – an ingenious device that combined metal prisms for moulding letters with an oil-based ink and techniques found in wine production.[2]
By reducing the cost and increasing the speed at which books were produced, the printing press unleashed a communications technology that would revolutionise our world. In fact, an original Gutenberg bible is on display in the beautiful setting of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library in Yale.
But the printing press arrived at a time when literacy rates were still exceptionally low – around 9% in Gutenberg’s native Germany.[3]Its ultimate benefits depended on rising literacy rates in the centuries that followed, with cheaper and more plentiful books also lowering the costs of learning. Countries that were quicker to embrace literacy reaped the gains in higher rates of economic growth and GDP per capita – a correlation that persists to this day.[4]
In more recent centuries, we can identify three conditions that need to be in place for ideas to reach their full potential: translation, diffusion and ambition.
Translation means the ability to translate ideas into socially usable projects. And history has shown us that this ability depends on having the right economic ecosystems in key areas like finance and the supply of inputs.
For example, until the turn of the 17th century, the ability to fund new ideas was severely limited by underdeveloped financial markets. One factor that helped change the game was the emergence of the modern joint-stock, limited-liability company around this time.[5]
Suddenly, large pools of capital could be raised to fund bold proposals, such as expanding global shipping routes from east to west, which facilitated supplies of inputs. Countries that embraced joint-stock companies tended to experience faster growth.[6]
If the right economic ecosystem infrastructurescan facilitate ideas, the reverse is also true. The pioneering rollout of railroads across the US continent proved revolutionary in spurring the development of the country’s capital markets.[7]
But for ideas to be truly impactful at the macro level, there also needs to be diffusion. Technologies need to spread through an economy and become widely used.
History suggests that a key factor in the diffusion of ideas is scale: that is, operating in a large, integrated market. Scale encourages firms to adopt new technologies, so that by expanding their production they can achieve lower unit costs.
The clearest example of the impact of scale is in the United States. While its constitution brought together thirteen disparate colonies, the country’s economic trajectory would ultimately depend on how that constitution – in particular its Commerce Clause − was interpreted.
A pivotal moment occurred in 1824, when the Supreme Court’s decision inGibbons v. Ogdenasserted the right of Congress to regulate interstate commerce and, in effect, to override state-granted monopolies that risked fragmenting the US market.
This decision helped establish a truly nationwide economy and allowed the ideas of US entrepreneurs to spread and flourish. By several estimates, US GDP per capita at least doubled between 1800-20 and 1820-40.[8]
In many of these cases, however, change did not happen by itself. It happened because of the ambition of entrepreneurs, economists, jurists or policymakers, their courage in overcoming hurdles to progress, and their ability to inspire others to follow their vision.
But the nature of this ambition always evolved with the times.
In the 1800s, remote states scattered across the United States needed visionary entrepreneurs like Cornelius Vanderbilt, whose railways helped unify the country’s economy. But as railroad tycoons established monopolies that undermined the public good, it took the ambition of policymakers like Theodore Roosevelt to break them up and foster competition.
What truly unlocks growth is when these three forces combine: when ideas translate into innovations, innovations diffuse into productivity growth, and our societies have the necessary ambition to remove any barriers that are in the way.
The power of ideas today
This brings me to the present day.
As our economies grow, the relative importance of the different forces that drive growth changes.[9]For emerging economies that are far away from the technological frontier, deploying first their labour and later capital can help them to catch up.
But once economies mature and become advanced, productivity increases are mostly what propels us forward. And productivity is above all about ideas.
Most advanced economies, however, have seen productivity decelerate for some time. This slowdown led to a debate in the 2010s between techno-pessimists, who believed that most groundbreaking ideas were behind us, and techno-optimists, who believed that we were on the cusp of a new technological revolution.
Developments in recent years suggest that the case for optimism was stronger. Just as in Gutenberg’s time, new revolutionary technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are on the verge of transforming our societies. One study finds that generative AI alone has the potential to add up to almost USD 4.5 trillion annually to the global economy, roughly 4% of global GDP.[10]
The good news for global productivity growth is that we see these new ideas flourishing across major economies, a direct legacy from the common ties that were crafted during the era of globalisation. And Europe, in contrast to what some may believe, is actually well placed to benefit from these ideas.
The European Union accounts for around one-fifth of the world’s most-cited publications, patents, and research – despite making up less than 7% of the global population[11]– and this innovative activity includes key sectors such as AI and machine learning.
According to one study, Europe draws in more AI talent than the United States, with over 120,000 active AI roles, and last year, Europe accounted for one-third of total early-stage capital invested in AI and machine learning across the two economies.[12]
Our region also has many innovative companies in other high-tech sectors. Europe’s manufacturing firms often operate at the global frontier, be it in producing photolithography machines for advanced chips or industrial robotics. In fact, Europe’s share of the market for such robots is double that of China and more than thirtyfold that of the United States.[13]
And many of Europe’s most successful companies are not even listed. Of the 2,700 “hidden champions” worldwide – that is, small and medium-sized enterprises that are global leaders in their niche markets – more than half are found in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.[14]
But as globalisation recedes and technological change accelerates, all economies are facing bottlenecks in transforming these ideas into sustained productivity growth.
And these bottlenecks are in the same three areas that have been critical to unlocking the potential of ideas throughout history: translation, diffusion and ambition.
So, the question we face is: how can we break these bottlenecks?
Breaking the bottlenecks
Let me start with the first bottleneck, translation.
To translate new ideas into marketable projects, we need economic ecosystems that are suited to the specific requirements of today’s technologies.
We need financial systems that allow us to invest massively in innovative firms.
Sectors like AI, for example, need a lot of cash upfront to build up computing power and server capacity. According to industry leaders, the cost of training AI models is set to jump tenfold in the space of a year, and could soon rise to between USD 5 and 10 billion.[15]
And we need secure access to a wide range of natural resources.
The International Energy Agency estimates that training a single AI model uses more electricity than 100 US households consume in an entire year.[16]And as we electrify our transport systems and invest in renewable energy technologies, global demand for rare earth elements may increase three to sevenfold between now and 2040.[17]
So, all our economies need to be proactive in ensuring that we have these ecosystems in place. But in Europe we face two specific challenges.
First, we have a large financial sector, backed by high rates of saving from European households. But intermediation mainly takes place through bank lending rather than capital markets, which issue bonds and equities.
Bank lending works well for established companies that are relatively low risk and have generous collateral, such as our traditional manufacturing leaders. But it works less well for young, high-risk companies that typically drive radical innovation.
Innovative companies need access to ample risk capital, which requires a large venture capital sector that can back them until they go public. But the availability of risk capital is around ten times lower in Europe than in the United States,[18]meaning that even firms that find backing at the early stage have less support when they enter the growth stage. The average venture capital-backed company in the EU receives about five times less backing than its US peers over its life cycle.[19]
This gap often means that European entrepreneurs have to go overseas to get the financing they need – and sometimes their ideas go with them. And it is a key reason why, last year, Europe invested just USD 1.7 billion in generative AI compared with USD 23 billion of US venture capital and private equity.[20]
Second, we are not endowed with significant natural resources in Europe, meaning that we depend heavily on imports.[21]And this dependency leaves us vulnerable in a less globalised world and a changing geopolitical landscape.
The brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to an almost complete shut-off of gas supplies to Europe, shows what is at stake. Even though we have successfully replaced Russia as a supplier, that process has left our firms at a notable cost disadvantage.
Before the pandemic, electricity costs for European firms were 1.7 times higher than those in the United States and 1.2 times as high as China. Now, that gap is 2.5 and 2.3 times respectively.
In both cases, however, Europe is creating solutions in response to these constraints. As the former French President, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, is reputed to have said, “We may not have oil, but we have ideas.”
Where we can, we are acting to build the ecosystems we need internally. Just last week, Europe’s leaders agreed to push forward with developing Europe’s capital markets union, with a strong focus on improving the conditions for the financing options of European scale-ups.[22]
We are also frontloading investment in renewables, which will ultimately make us more energy independent, although this process will take time and we will need to be realistic.
In the interim, we may need to depend even more on countries that have the necessary resources. For example, 80% of the global supply for rare earth metals currently comes from just three countries.[23]
But we are also working together with our friends and allies who face similar bottlenecks, like the United States, to make our supply more diversified. For example, the EU intends to establish a Critical Raw Materials Club, inviting partners with similar geopolitical and economic security concerns to join in the pooling of investments.[24]
But once ideas are commercialised, they need to be diffused. Remember that what drives long-term growth is not only innovation by superstar firms, but also that innovations spread widely to less productive ones.
Historically, one of the strongest drivers of technology diffusion has been free trade, especially between our two economies. For example, analysis points to a lag of three to four years between innovations in US industry and those in European industry.[25]
But research suggests that diffusion has slowed across advanced economies in recent decades[26]– a trend that may partially reflect the nature of the digital economy itself, which tends to create “winner-takes-the-most” markets.[27]
And in Europe’s specific case, slow diffusion also reflects the fact that, unlike the United States, we have not yet fully unlocked our innate scale as a continental-sized economy.
We have developed a business model in Europe that is unusually reliant – for a large economy, at least – on selling to other large economies, including capital goods that enable them to exploit their own scale. More than a third of our manufacturing GDP is absorbed outside the EU, compared with around a quarter for China and just a fifth for the United States.[28]
But we have not made full use of our own scale to encourage our companies to adopt more technology. We are home to over 445 million consumers and 23 million firms[29]and yet our internal market remains fragmented, especially for services.[30]Intra-EU trade in services accounts for only about 15% of GDP compared with over 50% for goods.[31]
This untapped potential is costing us dearly in terms of foregone growth and productivity gains. Remaining trade frictions in the EU mean that we are leaving around 10% of potential EU GDP on the table, according to one estimate.[32]
And it is also affecting our competitiveness. We now see that other major economies are using their combination of technology and scale to push ahead faster in key sectors. China may now be leading in 37 of 44 critical technologies including electric batteries, hypersonics and advanced high-frequency communications such as 5G and 6G.[33]
But Europe is also acting on this front to lift its constraints. Last week, Europe’s leaders welcomed a major new report on the Single Market, calling for removing the remaining barriers in the cross-border provision of services as well as a “policy shift” to reflect the new geopolitical and competitive environment.[34]
And here again, Europe and the United States have shared interests in working together, especially in ensuring a level playing field between countries that play by the rules, while acting robustly in instances where rules are being broken to create an unfair advantage.[35]
In other words, we should not become engaged in a subsidy race between our economies, which creates a zero-sum game. We should instead ensure that we use our collective weight in international trade to discourage others from anti-competitive practices, while increasing the free flow of ideas amongst ourselves – a positive-sum game.
Will we be able to achieve all this? Ultimately, it is a question of ambition – and that is the final bottleneck we will have to break.
In recent years, leadership has often beenreactivein nature. This has been somewhat understandable in an era of “permacrisis” – in which one shock, like the pandemic, is quickly followed by another, such as the outbreak of war.
But reactive leadership is no longer enough.
Crises are becoming ever more global, requiring unprecedented levels of coordination across several sectors of society. And at the same time, the world is moving in directions that make such cooperation more difficult.
That is why we needproactiveleadership – where we define the flow of events instead of simply responding to them. And for this we need to be far more ambitious.
The history of Europe gives us many examples of how effective such leadership can be. In the 1950s, an era marked by supply shortages and rationing, Europe started building common supply chains and pooling the production of inputs such as coal and steel.
In the mid-1980s, when Europe had exhausted the potential of what was then its common market, it forged ahead by creating the Single Market and reinvigorating growth.
And in the 1990s, when exchange rate volatility threatened the stability of our currencies, we pushed forward with our monetary union to anchor our Single Market.
In doing so, we achieved what many had once thought impossible, and progressively united a continent that had been torn apart by two world wars.
When I look across advanced economies today, I am confident that our leaders understand what is required of them. Both the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act in the United States are accelerating the take-up of new technology. And I have listed many initiatives in Europe that are in the works, while there are many more that I have not touched upon.
But focusing on Europe in particular, what gives me hope is that, unlike after the great financial crisis, both leaders and citizens are aligned on what needs to be done.
We realise that we can no longer afford to see ourselves as a loose club of independent economies. That perspective is outdated in a world that is fragmenting into geopolitical blocs centred around the largest economies. And we know that we need to start seeing ourselves as a single, large economy with predominantly shared interests.
This change in perspective also calls for joining forces in more areas.
We face increasing demands on spending from ageing populations, the climate transition and a changing security environment that we will only be able to meet together. And if we do not, we will face some difficult choices between sustaining our social model, delivering on our climate ambitions and playing a leading role in global affairs.
By acting as a Union to raise our productivity growth, and by pooling our resources in areas where we have a tight convergence of priorities – like defence and the green transition – we can both deliver the outcomes we want and be efficient in our spending so that we do not have to make sacrifices elsewhere.
And while this approach may require breaking some long-established taboos, we say in French that “nécessité fait loi” – or necessity knows no law.
Our citizens understand this reality, even in a context where populism is on the rise.
We see in poll after poll that Europeans believe that acting together is the best route to prosperity and security.
Over two-thirds of EU citizens feel that the EU is a place of stability in a troubled word,[36]more than three-quarters are in favour of a common defence and security policy,[37]and eight out of ten agree that the EU needs to invest massively in areas like renewable energy.[38]And in the euro area, support for our single currency remains close to record levels.[39]
So today, I am confident that the ambition of our policymakers and the will of our people are aligned, and that we will break the bottlenecks that are preventing us from reaching our potential.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The global economy finds itself at a turning point, with old realities being replaced by new uncertainties.
But amid all this change, some things remain resolutely the same. It is by generating new ideas, and creating the conditions in which they can spread and flourish through our economy, that we can drive future growth.
To create those conditions, Europe needs to break key bottlenecks in translation, diffusion and ambition. This will not be easy. But for too long we have simply talked about these problems instead of solving them through concrete actions. As Franklin once put it, “Well done is better than well said.”[40]
In the end, we have a simple choice to make: either we break these bottlenecks, or we let these bottlenecks break us. Given the sense of urgency, the support for action and the consensus on what Europe needs to do, I know which side I stand on. And I am confident we can succeed.
Thank you."

Statement by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the forty-ninth meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee
IMF Spring Meetings, 19 April 2024
Introduction
Since our last meeting in October, the global growth outlook has improved somewhat, reflecting revised growth prospects across both advanced and emerging market economies. The disinflationary process has continued amid falling energy prices, the normalisation of supply conditions and tight monetary policy. While the global economy has weathered the tightening of monetary policy well, growth prospects remain subpar by historical standards. Risks to the global outlook are broadly balanced for both economic activity and inflation, though rising geopolitical tensions pose an upside risk to inflation and a downside risk to growth.
The Governing Council in April kept the three key ECB interest rates unchanged at their September 2023 levels. It considers that these policy interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. The Governing Council’s future decisions will ensure that its policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. It will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining its interest rate decisions, based on the same three criteria that guided its decisions during the earlier tightening phase and the current holding phase: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. If the Governing Council’s updated assessment of these criteria were to further increase its confidence that inflation is converging to its 2% medium-term target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. At the same time, the Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
In March the Governing Council concluded the review of the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, which will help us steer short-term market rates in line with our policy stance as the Eurosystem balance sheet normalises. The new framework clarifies how the ECB will implement monetary policy in the future.
This year we also celebrated the 25th anniversary of the euro. This is an important reminder that there is strength in unity as we look ahead to future challenges.
Economic activity
Over the past year, economic activity in the euro area has broadly stagnated, as slower global demand and the impact of tighter financing conditions have weighed on growth. Real GDP was flat in the final quarter of 2023 and incoming data suggest that activity remained weak in the first quarter of 2024. Surveys point to a gradual recovery over the course of this year, as falling inflation and higher wages support real incomes and consumer spending. The dampening effect of past interest rate rises should fade over time and demand for euro area exports is expected to pick up, which should increasingly support investment.
The labour market remains resilient overall, but indicators point towards a cooling down of labour demand on the back of weaker economic activity. Employment continued to grow in the final quarter of 2023, mainly driven by an increasing labour force, and in February the unemployment rate remained at 6.5%, its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. Labour productivity is expected to recover in the future as labour hoarding unwinds and profit margins moderate.
Governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures so that disinflation can proceed sustainably. Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis. National fiscal and structural policies should be aimed at making the economy more productive and competitive, which would help to reduce price pressures in the medium term.
Risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. Weaker global demand would weigh on growth. Geopolitical risks – stemming from Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East – could lower confidence and lead to global trade disruptions. The dampening impact from earlier monetary policy action could still turn out stronger than expected. On the upside, a faster-than-expected decrease in inflation could support higher spending as real incomes rise, while stronger-than-expected global growth could also support a faster recovery.
Inflation
The disinflation process in the euro area has continued, broadening across all main components of inflation. In March 2024, headline inflation stood at 2.4%. The ongoing decline reflects the fading impact of large past supply shocks, lower energy commodity prices and tight monetary policy weighing on demand. Core inflation has remained somewhat more elevated, at 2.9% in March, due to the relatively larger role of domestic factors such as labour costs. The degree of further disinflation depends on the interplay of labour costs and profit margins. Wage growth has been high amid tight labour markets, but it started moderating in the second half of 2023. Together with negative productivity growth, high wage growth kept unit labour cost growth elevated, though profit margins are absorbing part of their impact on inflation. The disinflation process is expected to continue, especially once a recovery in productivity growth starts reinforcing downward pressure on labour cost growth. Inflation is expected to decline to 2.3% in 2024 and reach 2.0% around mid-2025.
Risks to the inflation outlook are two-sided. Upside risks include heightened geopolitical tensions, as well as higher wage growth and more resilient profit margins than anticipated. Downside risks include monetary policy dampening demand more than expected, and an unexpected deterioration in the economic environment in the rest of the world.
Financial stability, euro area banking sector and non-bank financial intermediation
The euro area financial system has remained strong, aided by declining inflation. Non-financial corporations and households have shown resilience and are poised to gain from a forthcoming easing of financing conditions. The outlook remains fragile, however, marked by elevated vulnerabilities stemming from weakening growth prospects, still tight financial conditions and the materialisation of geopolitical risks. As higher financing costs, a move towards hybrid working practices as well as environmental, social and governance requirements are likely to continue posing cyclical and structural challenges, we are closely monitoring developments in euro area real estate markets.
Euro area banking sector profitability reached its highest level since the global financial crisis but is likely to have peaked, as net interest margins started to decline in the last quarter of 2023. Banks are maintaining sizeable liquidity and capital buffers despite considerable reductions in central bank funding and substantial shareholder payouts. Specifically, significant banks reported an average liquidity coverage ratio of around 164% and an aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.7% at the end of 2023. Non-performing loan ratios remain close to historically low levels, although mild signs of deterioration are visible in loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and to the commercial real estate sector. Banks’ exposures to commercial real estate are contained, at around 5% of their total assets. The euro area banking sector has proven resilient to tensions in other parts of the world so far, and confidence in it has been supported by strong rules and supervision. Looking ahead, it is crucial that all jurisdictions finalise their implementation of Basel III.
Risks in the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector remain elevated, despite some portfolio rebalancing towards higher-quality assets. The sector is vulnerable to asset price corrections, macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility. These factors could contribute to rising outflows from open-ended investment funds, which can exhibit significant mismatches between asset liquidity and redemption terms, or to potential margin calls for investment funds, insurance companies and pension funds. Additionally, parts of the NBFI sector also display significant financial and synthetic leverage, which can propagate liquidity shocks to the wider financial system and amplify stress. Recent market episodes − including the turmoil in March 2020, commodity market tension in 2022 and UK government bond market stress in September 2022 − underline the need for international coordination to strengthen the NBFI policy framework, also from a macroprudential perspective.
International cooperation
We welcome the IMF’s continued support for Ukraine, in particular its recent approval of the third review of the Extended Fund Facility arrangement, marked by Ukraine’s strong performance under very challenging conditions. Timely disbursement of external support by all donors will be critical for the future of Ukraine’s programme. We also welcome the conclusion of the 16th General Review of Quotas in December 2023, which strengthens the quota-based nature of the IMF at the centre of the global financial safety net. The priority now is to implement the Review by mid-November 2024. We look forward to the upcoming evaluation by the Fund’s Independent Evaluation Office on the evolving application of the IMF’s mandate. Focusing on the IMF’s mandate and its cooperation with the World Bank will be important, also in their implementation of the Resilience and Stability Trust.
Geopolitical tensions are increasingly giving rise to economic and financial fragmentation and pose a significant risk to global prosperity. A world divided along geopolitical lines would be more prone to adverse supply shocks and reduced trade, possibly leading to higher inflation and lower welfare. We also see a greater deployment of trade-restrictive measures targeted at sectors considered strategically important for technological progress and the green transition. However, legitimate concerns about security and supply chain resilience should not lead to a spiral of protectionism. If we are to preserve the unparalleled achievements in global growth and poverty reduction made in the past decades, multilateral cooperation is more important than ever.
The COP28 Global Stocktake has clearly shown that the world is far off track to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, while our lives and economies are already being affected by the greater impact of natural disasters. Stronger international cooperation is essential for scaling up transition and resilience finance and shielding those who are hardest hit. Progress is needed on pricing carbon, putting the right regulatory framework in place and defining key elements of credible transition plans, both at sectoral and national levels. All stakeholders need to contribute within their mandate. The ECB has stepped up its efforts and recently published its new climate and nature plan 2024-2025. We will focus on three areas over the next two years: navigating the green transition, addressing the physical impact of climate change, and understanding the risk that nature loss poses to our economies and the financial system."

Introductory remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECON Committee of the European Parliament
Brussels, 18 April 2024
I am pleased to appear before this Committee to present the ECB’s Annual Report for 2023[1], a year in which the ECB consolidated progress in its fight against inflation. As well as assessing economic developments in the euro area in 2023, our Annual Report gives an account of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy and other activities conducted by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). In response to European Parliament resolutions, it also includes a box explaining how the ECB’s secondary objective is considered in the conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy and reporting activities.
Today we are also publishing our written feedback statement, which provides responses to the European Parliament’s resolution on our previous Annual Report.[2]
In my remarks today, I will start by focusing on the economic outlook for the euro area and the monetary policy decisions taken at our recent monetary policy meeting. I will then briefly update you on our current financial stability assessment before going on to discuss the importance of a resilient financial system.
As detailed in the Annual Report, euro area growth slowed to 0.4% in 2023 after expanding by 3.4% in 2022. This slowdown was to some extent attributable to the economic repercussions of Russia’s war against Ukraine. The impact of higher interest rates alongside spillover effects from the weak industrial sector to services also weighed on growth.
Euro area headline inflation declined by 6.3 percentage points over the course of 2023 to reach 2.9% at the end of the year. The decline was broad based across all the main components of inflation, reflecting the fading impact of previous large supply shocks, lower energy commodity prices and tight monetary policy.
This year, economic indicators suggest that activity has got off to a weak start and will recover only gradually. Consumer spending is set to remain sluggish in the near term but should strengthen as real disposable income continues to recover. Private investment is expected to show continued weakness in the period ahead before the impact of weak final demand and tight financing conditions starts to fade.
Inflation has fallen further this year and is expected to continue declining in the medium term, but at a slower pace. Measures of underlying inflation have been easing but domestic price pressures remain elevated. Wage growth has remained strong amid robust labour markets but has been moderating recently, while profits are absorbing part of the effects of wage increases on prices.
The ECB reacted forcefully to heightened inflation: it raised its key policy rates by a cumulative 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023 and has kept them unchanged since then. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. At our most recent monetary policy meeting on 11 April 2024 we considered that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
Let me also give you a brief update on the operational framework review we concluded in March, which you have discussed on previous occasions with the ECB President.[3]The changes will affect how central bank reserves will be provided as excess liquidity gradually declines. The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance by adjusting the deposit facility rate (DFR) and short-term interest rates are expected to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR with tolerance for some volatility. Liquidity will be provided through a broad mix of instruments, including existing regular refinancing operations as well as – at a later stage – new structural longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio of securities. Our existing regularrefinancing operations will continue to be conducted through fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment against broad collateral, and the interest rate on the main refinancing operations will be adjusted later in the year to 15 basis points above the deposit facility rate. The key parameters of the framework will be reviewed in 2026 or earlier if necessary.
Let me now turn to our assessment of the financial sector.
During my last appearance before this Committee, we discussed the importance of maintaining a resilient financial system following the banking sector turmoil in the United States and Switzerland.
Since then, the euro area financial system has remained strong, aided by declining inflation. Confidence in euro area banks has benefited from strong rules and supervision. Banks have maintained sizeable liquidity and capital buffers, and non-performing loan ratios remain close to historically low levels. At the same time, firms and households have shown resilience in the face of rising debt servicing costs resulting from higher interest rates.
However, this positive outlook for financial stability in the euro area should not be taken for granted. It could face significant challenges if growth prospects weakened, inflation stayed above target for a longer period or further geopolitical risks materialised.
We are also closely monitoring developments in euro area real estate markets as tighter financing costs, a move towards hybrid working practices as well as environmental, social and governance requirements are likely to continue to put pressure on this market segment. Although mild signs of asset quality deterioration are becoming visible in commercial real estate (CRE) lending, risks to this asset class are broadly contained given that banks’ CRE exposures, standing at around 5% of total assets, are limited. Our Financial Stability Review, which is due to be published mid-May, will provide more details of our assessment on this.
To support continued financial sector resilience, legislators still have a lot of work to do in the coming years to close the gaps in our banking union. Besides urgent reform of the bank crisis management and deposit insurance framework, we must set up a European framework for liquidity in resolution and, most importantly, a fully-fledged European deposit insurance scheme. We also need a solid institutional and policy framework for the non-bank financial sector and we welcome the European Commission’s forthcoming macroprudential framework review.
Moreover, during the next EU institutional cycle, the level of ambition and commitment devoted to the capital markets union (CMU) agenda must finally match the urgent need to make progress. Completing CMU is key to strengthening resilience, enhancing EU competitiveness, growing our economy and achieving the EU’s policy objectives, such as funding the green and digital transitions. In this spirit, the ECB Governing Council recently published a statement on advancing CMU.[4]
As this parliamentary term comes to an end and a new one begins in a few months’ time, let me reiterate that the ECB is counting on this Parliament to support these efforts with ambition and commitment.
Thank you for your attention. I now stand ready to answer your questions."

Keynote speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the thirteenth conference organised by the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy, “Monetary Policy Challenges during Uncertain Times”, at the Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.
Washington, DC, 17 April 2024
Since the early 1990s, many central banks worldwide have adopted a framework for monetary policy known as “inflation targeting”.[1]In this framework, central banks announce a target rate or range for medium-term inflation, typically 2%, and adjust short-term interest rates to steer actual inflation towards the target.[2]
The rise of inflation targeting was a response to the turbulent inflation episodes of the 1970s and 1980s when most central banks were only loosely committed to price stability. Inflation targeting was an acknowledgement that monetary policy was most effective when it was given a clear mandate.
Inflation targeting went hand-in-hand with a discernible increase in central bank independence and transparency. Central banks operating outside the influence of political election cycles played a critical role in making inflation targeting credible and feasible. Political independence, in turn, required central bank officials to publicly explain and justify their actions as a manifestation of democratic accountability.
Greater transparency was also needed to operationalise inflation targeting. The reason is that, given the lags in monetary policy transmission, central banks can only affect future inflation. As such, inflation targeting has typically been formulated in terms of inflationforecasttargeting where the central bank adjusts policy to offset deviations of its projection of medium-term inflation from the target.[3]
Inflation forecast targeting requires the central bank to provide a coherent narrative to the public that links its current decisions to the way it expects economic activity and inflation to evolve over the policy-relevant horizon, typically over the next two to three years.
Inflation forecast targeting has been implemented differently across the central banking community.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Norges Bank and Sveriges Riksbank, for example, publish inflation forecasts that are conditional on a policy rate path consistent with delivering inflation in line with the target over the policy-relevant horizon. Similarly, the US Federal Reserve System provides policy rate forecasts through its Summary of Economic Projections.
While these interest rate paths do not constitute a formal commitment on the part of policymakers, they do provide forward guidance, which potentially raises the ability of central banks to manage interest rate and inflation expectations.[4]
Other central banks, including the ECB and the Bank of England, publish inflation projections based on financial market participants’ expected path for short-term interest rates.[5]In this case, the public typically expects policy to deviate from the market-implied path if the medium-term inflation forecast is inconsistent with the target.
At the ECB, the link between policy decisions and inflation projections was deliberately diluted, as projections are “owned” by staff and not the Governing Council.[6]In practice, however, inflation projections, whether owned by the committee or not, have over time become the main communication vehicle for most central banks worldwide, including the ECB.
Inflation forecast targeting and the surge in inflation
Inflation targeting has generally been a success.
Before the pandemic, inflation had been low and stable over three decades (Slide 2). And by providing a clear yardstick for the public to measure the central bank’s success in delivering on its mandate, inflation targeting has made monetary policy more transparent and accountable.
Yet, while changes to monetary policy frameworks had been important in bringing about benign inflation outcomes since the late 1980s, there is broad agreement that during that period, central banks benefited from a decline in macroeconomic volatility and globally subdued price pressures.[7]
In this environment, even systematic forecast errors by central banks had only limited impact on their credibility.[8]In the euro area, for example, HICP inflation excluding energy and food was persistently over-projected between 2013 and 2019 (Slide 3, left-hand side).[9]
But since these forecast errors were small in absolute terms, and the public was not concerned about a limited undershooting of inflation targets, the appropriateness of central banks’ broader policy frameworks was not questioned, and neither was their ability to maintain price stability.
However, the pandemic changed all of this.
Inflation forecast errors rose measurably and remained persistent.[10]This was not because central banks were particularly bad at projecting inflation. After all, significant forecast errors were made by professional forecasters and international institutions alike (Slide 3, right-hand side).
Rather, it was because the size of the shocks hitting our economies increased sharply, with some of them entailing fundamental structural changes to the economy, making inflation forecasting an extremely difficult undertaking. These forecast errors, in turn, arguably contributed to central banks’ delayed reaction to the surge in inflation.
Data dependence challenges inflation forecast targeting
Central banks are currently trying to draw the right lessons from recent experience.
Perhaps the most important one is that the post-pandemic surge in inflation has validated rather than refuted the inflation targeting framework. Despite inflation often reaching double-digit levels, long-term inflation expectations have remained broadly anchored around 2% across advanced economies (Slide 4).
This is a strong vote of confidence in the central bank’s determination and ability to restore price stability. By keeping inflation expectations anchored, central banks managed to significantly reduce the persistence of inflation, thereby helping avoid the output losses that had been necessary in the 1980s to bring inflation down from elevated levels.
A second area of reflection relates to the role central bank projections should play in calibrating and communicating monetary policy.
In response to the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the ECB adjusted the way it presented and used economic forecasts in its decision-making process. Alternative scenarios and extensive sensitivity analyses complemented the baseline and helped to convey the considerable increase in uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy.
In addition, in early 2023, when interest rates had already been raised considerably, we clarified that the large prevailing uncertainty about the medium-term inflation outlook required a data-dependent approach to monetary policy, where the observed dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission would serve to cross-check the inflation projections.[11]
These measures effectively marked a departure from “textbook” inflation forecast targeting. As projection errors, even over short horizons, rose to unprecedented levels in the wake of the recent energy crisis, the baseline scenario was no longer a sufficient summary indicator for calibrating and communicating monetary policy actions.
Breaking this link was not entirely new. Already in 2019, following a long period of subdued price pressures, the ECB adopted rate forward guidance that conditioned its future actions not only on the inflation outlook but also on the actual progress in underlying inflation dynamics. This was also intended to ease financing conditions further.
But in the high-inflation period, the stakes were arguably higher. Consider the June 2022 Eurosystem staff projections as an example. These projections were the first opportunity to fully reflect on the impact of the war in Ukraine on activity and prices in the euro area. They foresaw inflation to average 3.5% in 2023, almost two percentage points below the actual outcome of 5.4%, with interest rates being markedly higher than expected in 2022.
Should we return to strict inflation forecast targeting?
The question we are facing today is whether, in view of the recent normalisation of forecast errors, central banks should return to the strict inflation forecast targeting that prevailed most of the time before the pandemic.
This question is not about whether central banks should use model-based forecasts or not. Good policymaking will always have to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect central macroeconomic variables. In other words, models are indispensable.
It is not about whether central banks should be forward-looking, either. Again, there is no question that a central bank must focus on medium-term inflation. It should not form its decisions by looking only in the rear-view mirror.
Instead, the question is whether we should give the baseline projections a weight in policy calibration and communication, so that deviations of projected medium-term inflation from the target would almost mechanically trigger expectations of policy adjustments.
Clarity on how central banks intend to conduct policy over the medium term is certainly important for predictability and hence transmission. During the past few months, financial markets have repeatedly repriced the future expected path of short-term interest rates in different directions, thereby affecting actual financing conditions (Slide 5).[12]
These swings do not necessarily imply a lack of understanding of central banks’ reaction functions, as there was often a wedge between the medium-term inflation outlook expected by investors and central banks.
But they do suggest that investors expect policymakers, at least for now, to continue to pay more attention to actual inflation outcomes, or to the tails of the forecast distribution, than what a typical inflation forecast targeting central bank would do.
Putting less weight on the baseline forecast in the decision-making process has two drawbacks.
First, it may lead to excessive volatility if financial markets overreact to individual data prints. The sensitivity of short-term interest rates to surprises in the most relevant macroeconomic indicators is currently at elevated levels (Slide 6).
Second, it could increase the risk that, should the central scenario materialise, monetary policymakers may have waited too long to adjust the stance in their search for “sufficient confidence”. In the current context, being behind the curve can be costly in terms of lost output.
At the same time, despite the reduction in forecasting errors, there are a number of reasons suggesting that it could be prudent to continue to consider the baseline forecast as just one input to policy decisions, or to consider other changes to the framework, including in communication, even as inflation continues to fall.
First, while central forecasts are easy to communicate, they convey a false sense of precision.
At the ECB, significant resources are constantly devoted to improving the set of models used for forecasting.[13]After the global financial crisis, for example, credit and banking gained prominence in our workhorse models. More recently, we made important changes to the assumptions about the pass-through of energy prices to consumer prices in the presence of large cost-push shocks.[14]
But no matter how much we improve our models, projections will always be surrounded by a significant degree of uncertainty.
Take energy inflation as an example.
During the recent inflation surge, errors in the conditioning assumptions for energy prices – based on market futures prices – explained, on average, about three-quarters of the Eurosystem and ECB staff projection errors for inflation four quarters ahead (Slide 7).
While other forecasting techniques, such as using random walk assumptions, may sometimes yield superior outcomes, there is no one method that consistently outperforms the others.
Uncertainty is even greater when estimating and forecasting unobservable variables, such as the output gap or the natural rate of interest. While being of first-order importance for assessing inflationary pressures or the restrictiveness of monetary policy, neither concept can be pinned down in real time with any reasonable degree of precision.
In addition, forecasts of models estimated on historical time series tend to revert to the mean towards the end of the projection horizon.
This mean reversion is an integral part of inflation targeting, based on the assumption that long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored at target. This approach is reasonable for as long as this assumption is confirmed by surveys and market prices.
But when shocks are large and persistent, and inflation expectations are at risk of de-anchoring, mean reversion can make monetary policy procyclical.
Consequently, there is a risk that policymakers react too late when the economy is hit by a more persistent inflation shock, and that policy is loosened too early when inflation falls again. In other words, mean reversion introduces an easing bias during inflation shocks and a tightening bias during disinflation shocks.
Biases may also occur due to the incremental approach typically used in forecasting when new projections start from the most recent vintage. This may lead to an excessive degree of inertia, especially at turning points, which models typically have a hard time anticipating given the lack of tools to identify changes in the trajectory of key economic variables in real time.
The use of judgement can partly compensate for such shortcomings. However, the line between technical and policy judgement is often blurred. And in a large monetary policy committee, such as the Eurosystem, where the projection process has deliberately been delegated to staff, policy judgement should ideally be the outcome of deliberations rather than an input to the baseline scenario.
Second, inflation forecast targeting typically relies on the assumption that supply side shocks are transitory, meaning changes in economic activity result predominately from changes in aggregate demand along a balanced steady-state growth path.
As monetary policy works mainly on the demand side, it can be optimally adjusted to offset the impact of expected changes in activity on prices and wages, taking into account the lags in policy transmission. This is the “divine coincidence” at work.
However, these might not be the kind of conditions facing central banks in the foreseeable future.[15]
Last year, in her speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, ECB President Christine Lagarde laid out the significant potential for pervasive and persistent shocks to affect the supply side and hence wages, inflation and interest rates.[16]Examples are climate change, the rapid ageing of our population and the rise of generative artificial intelligence.
In addition, the nature of globalisation is changing fundamentally. Not only are firms reconsidering the robustness of their value chains in the light of significant geopolitical uncertainties, they are also facing fiercer global competition in many areas.
China, in particular, is transitioning away from being the world’s manufacturing base towards becoming a major player in high-tech industries, such as electric vehicles. Over the past few years, Chinese firms have rapidly gained global market shares (Slide 8, left-hand side).
These developments are unfolding alongside the persistent effects of the recent shocks to our economies. It is becoming increasingly clear that the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine are having long-lasting, if not permanent, effects on the euro area economy.
For example, despite the significant drop in energy prices, the output of energy-intensive industries, such as chemicals and basic metals, has dropped considerably more than that of other sectors over the past two years (Slide 8, right-hand side).
The pandemic, meanwhile, has exacerbated the secular decline in hours worked per person employed. Today, people are working on average 2% fewer hours compared with the five-year average before the pandemic, contributing to labour shortages (Slide 9, left-hand side).
At the same time, we are seeing a strong rebound in the labour force, owing largely to the contribution from foreign workers (Slide 9, right-hand side).[17]However, over time this increase in the labour force may be countered, and possibly more than offset, by the projected decline in the domestic working-age population.
Overall, these supply-side shocks are difficult to anticipate and can have very different effects on wages and inflation than shocks triggered by changes in aggregate demand, making inflation forecast targeting considerably more challenging.
Finally, inflation forecast targeting relies on a stable and effective transmission of monetary policy, so that changes in the monetary policy stance have the desired and predicted effects on projected inflation.
The experience over the past ten years, however, has challenged our understanding of the way changes in short- and long-term interest rates affect output and inflation.
Before the pandemic, record low, and even negative, interest rates failed to provide sufficient stimulus to lift the economy out of a low-growth, low-inflation environment.
Evidence is pointing increasingly towards monetary policy transmission to activity and prices being highly non-linear, with diminishing returns when financing conditions are very loose.[18]
Today, researchers are trying to reconcile the surprising resilience shown by parts of the economy with the sharpest tightening cycle in decades.
This resilience is most evident in the United States where growth remains surprisingly buoyant. But questions about the strength and lags of policy transmission have emerged across a broad range of economies.
Evidence from the euro area, for example, is increasingly consistent with the view that monetary policy transmission is highly state-dependent.
During the current tightening cycle, large cash positions held by firms, a rotation of spending from goods to services, a high share of fixed-rate mortgages, comparatively healthy borrower balance sheets and resilient employment amid persistently tight labour markets may all have dampened policy transmission.
Even though a considerable amount of effort is made to understand all these channels, anticipating them in real time is inherently difficult. They typically only become visible once transmission is at a more advanced stage, making policy calibration based narrowly on projections a difficult exercise. This is even more the case if structural shocks also affect the natural rate of interest, creating uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness of current monetary policy.[19]
Dot plots and alternative scenarios could offer solutions
The question, then, is how policy frameworks can be adjusted to deal with these challenges for calibrating policy and communicating decisions to the public.
Last week, Ben Bernanke presented possible solutions in his review of the Bank of England’s forecasting framework.[20]Some of the points he raised could also be of relevance to the ECB.
One area of reflection relates to whether policymakers’ views on their expected future path of short-term interest rates should be made more transparent, akin to the “dot plot” used by the Federal Reserve System.[21]
The distribution of these paths could help signal the risks members of the committee attach to the baseline scenario built by staff. The narrower the distribution, the stronger the implied endorsement by policymakers, and vice versa.[22]
A dot plot can therefore help convey the uncertainty about the future path of the economy and simultaneously provide greater clarity about where policymakers see interest rates moving in the future, potentially working against excessive market volatility.
A downside to the publication of interest rate paths is that they may overly condition market pricing, thereby de facto reducing its informational content. Recent research shows that the dot plots may have lowered US real long-term bond yields by around 130 basis points over the last decade.[23]
A second, and complementary, option is to systematically include alternative scenarios to communicate the uncertainty around central bank projections more directly. By looking at different and potentially equally realistic paths for growth and inflation, there may no longer be a central scenario.
The ECB conducts scenario analyses frequently. The most recent projection report looked at how an escalation of disruptions in the Red Sea could affect output and inflation in the euro area.[24]
Our technical assumptions are also subject to regular sensitivity analysis. At present, for example, the option-implied gas price distribution indicates pronounced upside risks to the March 2024 baseline scenario.
These alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses, however, are currently not receiving the weight and attention they deserve among central bank watchers, with most focusing narrowly on the point forecast of inflation two to three years ahead.
One reason for this might be that the scenarios we consider are, in most cases, partial rather than general equilibrium, or restricted to tail events, meaning that they do not seriously challenge the main narrative underlying the baseline scenario.
To signal more clearly the significant uncertainty surrounding the baseline, realistic alternative scenarios – possibly presenting the range of views within the committee – could test some of the main assumptions feeding the baseline.
The challenges currently facing the euro area demonstrate how this could be done.
In one scenario, monetary policy is expected to succeed in creating conditions such that firms will absorb large parts of current high unit labour cost growth in their profit margins alongside a recovery in labour productivity growth. In this case, underlying price pressures would gradually abate, and inflation would return to, or even undershoot, the target over the projection horizon.
This is broadly the narrative underlying the current ECB and Eurosystem staff projections. Such a scenario could be augmented with additional sensitivity analysis, examining, for instance, by how much inflation could undershoot the target if the effects of monetary policy were stronger than usually.
In an alternative scenario, productivity growth would remain depressed over the projection horizon and demand for less interest-rate sensitive services could remain sufficiently strong to allow firms to pass a larger share of the increase in labour costs on to consumers. This scenario would take into account that the capacity of firms in the services sector to absorb rising input costs is more limited than in other sectors, such as industry or agriculture, where profits have been rising much more forcefully over the past years and where falling input prices have created space to absorb other cost increases. Overall, in this scenario, underlying price pressures could be stickier and the return of inflation to the 2% target delayed.
The regular and consistent use of such scenarios could better convey the uncertainty facing central banks and contribute to making policy decisions more robust by considering a range of plausible outcomes.
Conclusion
All this suggests, and with this I would like to conclude, that returning to the pre-pandemic policy framework, which relied heavily on central banks adjusting and communicating policy around a central inflation forecast, may come with risks. This framework may thus require a deeper re-think, even if inflation is getting closer to levels consistent with price stability.
As part of this re-think, central banks will need to carefully evaluate the role the central forecast should play in an environment characterised by higher macroeconomic volatility and persistent supply-side shocks, and how projections could be made more robust in order to place policymaking on a firmer footing, while allowing for clear and transparent communication about the inherent uncertainty.
Thank you."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the University College Dublin Economics Society
Dublin, 15 April 2024
My aim today is to review the recent evolution of inflation in the euro area, together with the implications for monetary policy. The ECB has held the main policy rate (the deposit facility rate) at 4.0 per cent since last September. At last week’s Governing Council meeting, we indicated that, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.[1]
Chart 1 shows the evolution of headline and core inflation since 2019[2]. Let me focus on the disinflation patterns since August 2023. Inflation stood at 5.2 per cent last August and has subsequently declined to 2.4 percent in March. Energy inflation has moved from -3.3 per cent last August to -1.8 per cent in March; food inflation has declined from 9.7 per cent to 2.7 per cent; and core inflation has fallen from 5.3 per cent to 2.9 per cent. Looking at the individual subcomponents of core inflation, there has been a reduction in goods inflation from 4.7 per cent to 1.1 per cent, and in services inflation from 5.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent.
In terms of the array of underlying inflation measures tracked by the ECB, Chart 2 shows the evolution of the refined versions of these measures, which adjust for the dynamic impact of energy shocks and supply bottlenecks.[3]The improvements in these measures since August 2023 suggest that the observed disinflation has a substantial persistent component. At the same time, there has been much less progress in relation to domestic inflation compared to broader inflation measures, reflecting the higher sensitivity of domestic inflation to local cost pressures. As captured in Chart 3, the overall disinflation rate largely reflects the unwinding of the supply shocks that were the primary source of the inflation surge in 2021-2022.
The role of monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large and persistent but temporary inflation shocks did not mutate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through the de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Since 2022, the central tendency distribution of longer-term inflation expectations has remained largely centred at the two percent target, reflecting the general credibility of the ECB’s commitment to delivering its inflation target.[4]Since last summer, a range of measures show that near-term inflation expectations have also come down and that the risk of inflation staying above target in the long term has diminished. Charts 4 to 8 shows the evolution of various indicators of inflation expectations and inflation risk: Chart 4 shows the right tail in the distribution of long-term inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters has markedly diminished compared to the peak inflation phase in late 2022; Chart 5 shows that the inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps has declined by about 40 basis points since last summer; Chart 6 shows that the option-implied probability of above 2.5 per cent inflation in the five-year-on-five-year interval has dropped, while the option-implied probability of below 1.5 per cent inflation has picked up; Chart 7 shows that, according to the Consumer Expectations Survey, households have recognised the improvement in inflation outcomes and marked down their near-term inflation expectations; finally, Chart 8 shows that, according to the results from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), firms have lowered their near-term inflation expectations, while the proportion of firms that fear high inflation in the medium term has decreased.[5]
The lowering of perceived inflation risk is plausibly connected to the faster-than-expected decline in inflation in recent months, which has provided reassurance that inflation would not remain too far away from target for too long. This is captured in Chart 9, which shows the evolution of the projected 2024 inflation rate over the September, December and March projection rounds. Chart 10 also shows the downward revisions to the 2024 growth rate over these projection rounds.
Despite the overall disinflation trend, services inflation remains high at 4.0 per cent. The decline in services inflation since last summer has largely been in non-labour-intensive services sectors, reflecting the indirect impact of lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the fading out of pandemic reopening effects on these sectors. As shown in Chart 11, there is a relatively tight medium-term relation between wage inflation and the inflation rate for labour-intensive services sectors (which make up a large part of the domestic inflation component). Over time, deceleration in wage growth is necessary in order for services inflation to converge to a rate that is consistent with meeting the two per cent target for overall inflation.
Wage pressures are gradually moderating but remain elevated compared to a steady-state benchmark. As shown in Chart 12, annual growth in compensation per employee decelerated in the fourth quarter of last year to 4.6 per cent, from 5.1 per cent in the third quarter. Growth in compensation per hour also slowed, falling in annual terms to 4.4 per cent in the fourth quarter from 5.0 per cent in the third quarter. The wages and salaries component of the labour cost indicator decreased to 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter from 5.1 per cent in the third quarter. Annual unit labour cost growth fell to 5.8 per cent, from 6.5 per cent, but remained high, in part reflecting weak productivity growth. Negotiated wage growth including one-off payments also declined further, falling to 3.2 per cent in January from 4.8 per cent in December, although this figure does not yet include the data for France and Italy.
As shown in Chart 13, forward-looking wage trackers also continue to provide signs of easing. As shown in Charts 14 and 15, the feedback from firms participating in the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS) and the SAFE point to lower wage growth this year. The March projections foresee subsequent phases of further wage deceleration in 2025 and 2026, with the growth rate of compensation per employee declining from 5.3 per cent in 2023 to 4.5 per cent in 2024, 3.6 per cent in 2025 and 3.0 per cent in 2026.
In addition to wage growth deceleration, the convergence of inflation to the target also requires compression in profits. As reflected in Chart 16, annual growth in unit profits decelerated further in the fourth quarter, falling to 2.8 per cent from 4.7 per cent in the third quarter. This significant decline was the main driver of the reduction in the annual growth rate of the GDP deflator, which fell by 0.6 percentage points to 5.3 per cent. As embedded in the March projections exercise, further compression in profits is required to support the convergence of inflation to the target, and a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance is necessary to provide the dampened demand conditions to limit the pass-through of rising costs to consumer prices.
In monitoring the transmission of the monetary policy stance,Chart 17 records the policy rate time series (together with the market-priced forward path) and Chart 18 the contraction in the Eurosystem balance sheet; Chart 19 depicts the evolution of the risk-free yield curve; Chart 20 plots bank lending rates for firms and households; Charts 21 and 22 report credit standards for firms and households; finally, Charts 23 and 24 report credit volumes for firms and households.
Finally, it should be recognised that the current phase of disinflation is necessarily bumpy. In particular, the swings in energy prices during 2023 will generate oscillations in base effects in the monthly inflation readings, while the staggered reversal of various temporary fiscal supports will also operate on the price level in an uneven manner. Chart 25 plots a range of indicators of near-term inflation dynamics and the projected quarterly evolution of headline and core inflation according to the March projections. Headline inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels in the near term on account of base effects in the energy component and the reversal of the upward effect of the early timing of Easter on services inflation in March. While services inflation should decline somewhat in the near term, it is expected to remain relatively elevated for most of this year.
Even if the near-term inflation outlook is somewhat bumpy, the projected convergence of inflation to the target in 2025 will be underpinned by: the lowering of labour cost pressures; some additional compression of unit profits; the dissipation of the adverse effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the pandemic re-opening; and the further unfolding of the disinflationary impact of the restrictive monetary policy stance. This disinflationary dynamic is consistent with both inflation stabilising at our target in 2025 and a substantial economic recovery, with rising real incomes and improvements in the terms of trade, together with the prospect of dis-inflation unlocking future interest rate reductions, boosting domestic consumption and investment, while the normalisation of foreign demand will facilitate growth in exports.
This review of the disinflation path in recent months and the analysis of the drivers of inflation over the projection horizon indicate that, based on the three elements of our reaction function we can conclude that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In informing this assessment, the June Governing Council meeting will benefit from updated staff projections and the accumulation of data about the dynamics of wages and profits in the opening months of this year. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Delphi Economic Forum IX
Delphi, 12 April 2024
For centuries the oracle of Delphi guided those seeking advice on what the future might hold.[1]Perhaps the most famous prophecy originating here from the Temple of Apollo is the one delivered during the Ancient Greek era to Croesus, the King of Lydia. When he consulted the oracle about going to war with Persia, he was told that if he were to attack, “a great empire would fall”. Emboldened by this apparent foresight, King Croesus went to war. And an empire did indeed fall. But it was the Lydians, not the Persians, who were defeated. The oracle was right. Yet King Croesus had overlooked the considerable room for interpretation that the prophecy allowed, with significant implications for his assessment of the outlook and the consequences of his decisions.
Today, policymakers count not on prophecies and oracles but on facts and science when assessing the outlook so they can make informed decisions. But while facts and science leave far less room for interpretation and uncertainty than ancient prophecies, they cannot eliminate it entirely. The scientific method requires established knowledge to be scrutinised and reviewed, especially – though certainly not exclusively – knowledge that pushes the boundaries of modern science. So science-based models that are used to describe what happens in the real world need to be updated regularly, in terms of both their structure and their parameters. And we have to acknowledge that these models are subject to uncertainty, including statistical, measurement and policy uncertainty. These caveats are relevant whenever we use these models to describe what has happened in the past, and they are especially relevant when assessing how present day knowledge is used to project an outlook for the future.
At the same time, policy must remain robust in the face of this uncertainty and build on what is scientifically established. Policymakers need to identify and spell out those questions that, if resolved, would reduce uncertainty and increase the level of confidence with which decisions are taken.
Today I will discuss how the prevailing evidence from climate and nature science can inform the actions of public authorities, even those that are not responsible for climate and nature policy, such as central banks and supervisors.[2]These public authorities – just like companies and individuals – are increasingly taking decisions whose outcomes will be subject to the tangible consequences of the ongoing climate and nature crises. In fact, in a ground-breaking ruling earlier this week, the European Court of Human Rights, explicitly referring to “the compelling scientific advice provided, in particular, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change”, established that States “need to put in place the necessary regulations and measures aimed at preventing an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth’s atmosphere and a rise in global average temperature beyond levels capable of producing serious and irreversible adverse effects on human rights”.[3]So how can we ensure that decisions taken today reflect what we know about climate science while remaining robust in the face of uncertainty?
Fundamental challenges of failing to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement
Currently, the best assessment by climate scientists tells us that the world is not on a path to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels – the overarching goal of the Paris Agreement. We are not even on course to limit the increase to 2 degrees. In fact, last November the UN Emissions Gap Report concluded that the world is on track for an average increase of 2.9 degrees, and even that will only be achieved if all government commitments to mitigation measures are implemented.[4]In other words, without a full and prompt implementation of these commitments, we will see an increase of even more than 2.9 degrees. In any case – acknowledging the uncertainty – the world is currently heading for a temperature rise far above the Paris Agreement goals.
This raises a number of critical challenges for maintaining wellbeing as we know it. These go far beyond the economic challenges that may emerge and will be particularly relevant for central banks and supervisors. In a recent report, the European Environment Agency sent a dire message about climate risks, pointing out that “several climate risks have already reached critical levels” and observing that “[i]f decisive action is not taken now, most climate risks could reach critical or catastrophic levels by the end of this century”.[5]Global heating will have an impact on food, water and energy security and the health of the general population, and these effects will be aggravated by ecosystem degradation, which is itself worsened by global heating. Moreover, increasing climate and natural hazards can disrupt critical infrastructure, putting people’s livelihoods and even their basic needs at risk.
There may also be second-round effects that compound the direct impact of an increase in climate and natural hazards. One example of this would be changes in migration flows, which like other such second-round effects are generally not yet accounted for in models of the impact of climate change and nature degradation. But the more severe the climate scenario, the more likely it is that these flows will increase, and the greater the impact these increasing flows will have.[6]
In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been increasingly emphasising the risks of various tipping points. These are critical thresholds that, when breached, will lead to large, accelerating and irreversible changes to our climate system. According to the most recent IPCC assessment report from 2021, the risk of reaching these tipping points is already assessed as being high if the average global temperature increase amounts to between 1.5 and 2.5 degrees. And it is assessed as very high if global temperatures increase by 2.5 to 4 degrees.[7]Climate science can provide indications of potential tipping points and what their consequences might be, like the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the impact it would have on global sea levels. There is, however, no scientific consensus yet on the systemic changes that might occur after these tipping points are reached. Further research is therefore urgently required here, especially in light of the current trajectory for global heating.[8]Over the last 12 months, the global average temperature was already 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
Structural economic challenges
Let me now turn to the implications for the global economy if temperatures increase by significantly more than 2 degrees. The structural economic consequences will be profound, with impacts on both the supply and demand sides of the economy.
First, resources will have to be dedicated to protecting citizens and society from increased climate and natural hazards like wildfires, droughts and floods.
Second, to the extent that the increase in hazards can no longer be avoided, the economy will need to cater for the critical needs that the European Environment Agency identifies as being at risk. Specifically, maintaining adequate food production, water availability and health care will require substantially more resources than those sectors currently receive.
Third, beyond catering for these critical needs, the economy will undergo further structural transformation as both preferences and production possibilities change. Tourism is a case in point, with destinations that are currently popular no longer being similarly in demand or even accessible in the future. Another example is international trade, which may be forced to redevelop as existing routes and ports become unavailable and others open up. And there will also be a reallocation between sectors, with some losing out while others benefit, much like we have seen following the pandemic and the energy crisis.
Fourth, the economy needs to be made resilient to the increase in climate and natural hazards. The existing capital stock – including people’s homes – will need to be upgraded and adapted, with all the increases in structural costs this entails. Achieving such resilience may even require physically relocating part of the capital stock to avoid proximity to areas that will be heavily exposed to hazards.
Any capital stock that is not made resilient to hazards will most likely see its economic lifespan shorten significantly. This will take the form of higher depreciation rates, which imply greater financial risks for anyone with exposures to the capital stock. It is particularly noteworthy that investments that are currently being made to green the capital stock may not be immune to this effect. For example, a hydroelectric power plant may become obsolete prematurely if a river runs dry or changes course. Resilience to the more disastrous climate and nature outcomes that are the consequence of failing to meet the Paris Agreement goals should, therefore, feature prominently in any decisions related to mitigation investment that are being taken today.
A key challenge for economic policymakers will be to ensure that the economy is suitably prepared to undergo these structural transformations. If it is not, there is a significant risk that economic and financial factors will actually exacerbate the critical challenges we will face in a world that overshoots the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Against this backdrop, it will be crucial for economic policymakers to identify potential barriers to effective and efficient adaptation. First, a failure to coordinate may lead to investment being misallocated. Some investments may not materialise at all if the private sector fails to consider the benefits for society. And others may materialise but only inefficiently, for example if investment in cooling homes and offices takes place at the level of individual households and firms.
Second, structural adjustment in an economy requires the right combination of flexibility, education and social safety nets to navigate an inclusive and effective adaptation process.
Third, financial bottlenecks may emerge. Increased uncertainty due to potential climate and natural hazards may lead to an increase in risk premia, which in turn could hold back investment. And this situation could be exacerbated if it is no longer possible to obtain insurance against certain risks – or if it is only possible at a prohibitive cost.[9]Besides the greater frequency and impact of hazards, uninsurable risks occur when hazards become systemic – in other words, when a hazard would affect the entire population at once if it were to materialise. And when such risks are uninsurable, individuals and firms – as well as the financial institutions that finance them – need greater loss-absorbing capacity themselves. This self-insurance will mean that – all other things being equal – the aggregate propensity to invest decreases further.
Bottlenecks in the flow of finance that reduce investment or that lead to misallocation can be mitigated with a sound banking system and well-developed capital markets that bolster transparency and ensures climate- and nature-related risks are properly priced. Against this backdrop, there is an urgent need to complete the banking union and the capital markets union – as the ECB has previously called for – irrespective of the climate and nature scenario that ultimately materialises.
In areas where private investment bottlenecks cannot be resolved, governments may need to step in with increased public investment and safety nets. This would give rise to significant government contingent liabilities that are not yet appropriately reflected in credit ratings or in institutional economic governance frameworks.
The relevance for central banks and supervisors
Many of the challenges I have mentioned – both the critical and the structural economic challenges – fall to policymakers in other areas, rather than central banks and supervisors. But the challenges presented and the policy choices that are taken in response will have a bearing on the environment in which central banks and supervisors pursue their mandates to maintain price stability and ensure the safety and soundness of banks.
First, our objectives are even more important in a world that is facing increased climate and natural hazards. Price stability and sound banks provide an anchor that makes an economy – and therefore a society – more resilient to shocks. The more frequent and intensive the shocks, the more important it becomes that the anchor doesn’t break.
Second, while our tasks become more important when the world around us becomes more daunting, maintaining price stability and a sound banking sector becomes more complicated. And this is not just because shocks are more frequent and more intense. It also becomes more complicated to assess the type of shock that is hitting the economy, yet this is crucial to gauging the potential risk to price stability or to the soundness of banks, as well as the appropriate policy response. It could raise questions about whether climate and natural hazards can be fully captured in the traditional categorisation of demand, supply and financial shocks that are inherent in most macroeconomic models. For example, my fellow ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel has suggested thinking about the impact of climate change on inflation using concepts that she has referred to as “climateflation”, “fossilflation” and “greenflation”.[10]The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, meanwhile, has already established that climate-related risks translate into the traditional types of risk that banks consider.[11]This covers credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk, including litigation risk.[12]However, the exact mechanisms of mapping actual hazards to risks still need to be analysed further to fully capture climate-related factors in quantifiable regulatory and supervisory requirements.
Third, climate and natural hazards limit the productive capacity of the economy. Some of the consequences may eventually fade – although they may well persist for quite some time – for example if supply chains are disrupted as a result of hazards materialising. Others may be permanent, for example if nature providing critical services – including land use and fisheries – becomes degraded. In both cases, the risk of the economy running into capacity constraints would be greater. Therefore, to properly assess the state of the economy and identify risks, central banks and supervisors need to further deepen their understanding of the supply side of the economy, just as we had to do after the pandemic and the energy crisis. This also means that we need to extend the horizon of our analyses well beyond the typical horizon considered today. Climate science gives us a window into the rest of this century. What we can see through this window should be taken seriously, including by central banks and supervisors as we identify and assess risks in the pursuit of our mandates. The time to think seriously about the long term is now.
Fourth, the combination of heightened uncertainty and a greater need for self-insurance could lead to an increase in the propensity to save in the private sector. This could create space for the investment that is so urgently needed and – in the absence of increased savings – would lead to an increase in the equilibrium real interest rate.[13]At the same time, if owing to coordination failures the increased savings are not channelled towards providing the investment needed, the equilibrium real rate of interest would instead be depressed. As this equilibrium rate is the interest rate that prevails when all shocks to the economy have dissipated and monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive, it is an important yardstick for central banks. Thus, for monetary policy, understanding which of these effects ultimately dominates will be key.
Fifth, increasing financial risks arising from the climate and nature crises can impair the soundness of financial institutions and the stability of the financial system as a whole. Should these risks materialise – despite all our efforts to mitigate them – the transmission of our monetary policy could be affected. Monetary policy decisions would be transmitted through the financial system and the economy in a less orderly and less predictable manner, potentially making it more difficult for us to achieve our price stability objective.
More generally, the effectiveness and efficiency of our policies benefit from well-functioning markets. This holds true in terms of both our ability to maintain price stability and the need to avoid the risk of our monetary policy impulses unduly contributing to a misallocation of resources.
Concluding remarks
Let me conclude.
The Temple of Apollo in Delphi famously bore the inscription “Know thyself” – a maxim that is often understood to mean “know your limits”.
Know what you know and know what you don’t know – this is what I have sought to convey to you today. And act upon that knowledge in a way that is robust in the face of known and unknown uncertainties, to avoid making avoidable mistakes like that of King Croesus after he consulted the oracle of Delphi. This includes identifying and seeking answers to questions that reduce uncertainty and increase the scope of “no-regret” policy actions. This will require policymakers to engage with stakeholders beyond their own fields of expertise – just like the Bank of Greece is doing through the interdisciplinary Climate Change Impacts Study Committee, which recently announced the preliminary results of analytical work on the economic, social and environmental impacts of climate change in Greece.[14]Experts from all disciplines – including climate and nature scientists, biologists, economists, legal experts and sociologists, to name just a few – will need to work closely together in responding to the multifaceted challenges ahead. If ever there was an urgent need to pool knowledge and draw on different fields of expertise, it is now.
Let me be clear: my remarks today are by no means a signal that we should throw in the towel on mitigation. Quite the opposite. I hope that I have been able to show you why, in light of the prevailing climate science, no effort should be spared in working towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. The European Climate Law requires it, and the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that governments that fail to meet their climate commitments are violating human rights. Analysis by the ECB and other central banks and supervisors repeatedly shows that, from an economic perspective, an orderly transition is by far preferable to alternative scenarios of doing nothing or doing too little too late.[15]
That said, even though climate and nature policymakers are under a legal obligation to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement and even if they have committed to achieving these objectives, they still have a duty to prepare for risks that lie ahead as the entire world needs to live up to its obligations – and it is not a given that it will – and critical thresholds may have already been surpassed. The duty to prepare for these risks also holds for central banks and supervisors in the pursuit of their mandates. We must both unwaveringly strive for the best and diligently prepare for what climate science tells us lies in store.
It is not a Delphic prophecy that is calling for action. It is facts and science.
Thank you for your attention."

Remarks by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at an event on climate-related financial risks hosted by the Banco Central do Brasil
Rio de Janeiro, 27 March 2024
Many thanks to the Banco Central do Brasil for inviting me here today. I am honoured to be speaking in Rio de Janeiro’s botanical garden. It is home to more than 6,500 different species – just a fraction of the more than 130,000 species that are estimated to be found in Brazil, the most biodiverse country in the world. But even this little glimpse into Brazil’s biodiversity is more than sufficient to appreciate the concept of natural capital and the tremendous value it represents.
At the same time, global heating and nature degradation are putting this natural capital at risk. And central banks and supervisors around the world recognise that this poses a serious threat to the stability of our economies and the robustness of our financial system.
Let me be clear from the outset: central banks and supervisors are not, and do not intend to be, policymakers in the area of climate and nature. It is governments that are responsible for climate and nature policies. In my remarks today, I will explain why central banks and supervisors have no option but to take the ongoing climate and nature crises into account to deliver on their monetary policy and banking supervision mandates. And that is exactly what central banks and supervisors around the world are doing. We at the European Central Bank (ECB) are not alone in this work, as can be seen from the work being done by the Banco Central do Brasil and most other central banks and supervisors around the world.
Human-induced global heating and nature degradation are scientifically established facts. Their devastating consequences are becoming all the more apparent in the increasing number of hazards we are seeing around the world. We don’t yet know exactly how the climate and nature crises will continue to unfold, partly because governments are taking mitigation and adaptation measures. This uncertainty also means that we don’t know exactly how the economy and the financial system will be affected.
At the same time, analysis consistently shows the vital importance of climate and nature for central banks and supervisors.
First, whatever happens, the economic impact will be profound. If left unchecked, global heating and nature degradation will contribute to increased macroeconomic volatility as climate and nature events become more frequent and have a greater impact on the economy. A successful transition to a green and sustainable economy, meanwhile, will require vast investment flows that will alter the way our economies function.
Second, the economic benefits of a timely transition far outweigh the costs, especially when considered against the alternative scenarios of doing nothing or doing too little too late.[1]
Third, climate-related risks translate into financial risks. Early work by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) shows that climate events are a driver of each traditional type of risk considered in the regulatory framework, from credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk to reputational and operational risk, including legal risk.[2]Floods, for example, could damage a company’s production facility, which could affect its ability to repay a loan, in turn leading to higher credit risk for the bank that provided the loan. Or consider what might happen if your house is built in an area vulnerable to wildfires. Your home could fall in value, leaving the bank that granted you the mortgage with higher risk on its balance sheet.
And these financial risks are not related solely to climate change. Last year, when looking at more than 4.2 million individual companies that account for over €4.2 trillion in corporate loans, we found that nearly 75% of all bank loans in the euro area are to companies that are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service.[3]Examples of these services include the products we obtain from ecosystems, such as food, drinking water, timber and minerals; protection against natural hazards; or carbon uptake and storage by vegetation. If these ecosystem services continue to experience the level of degradation they are currently facing, the stability of individual financial institutions and the broader financial system will be at risk.
Recognising the relevance of climate and nature-related factors for the economy, including the financial system, international standard-setting bodies are increasingly turning their attention to this topic. This has resulted in substantial progress at the global level, although more work lies ahead of us.
For example, the BCBS has a dedicated Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks, whose meeting this week is kindly hosted by the Banco Central do Brasil. Based on the work of this task force, the BCBS has taken concrete steps to incorporate climate-related financial risks into the Basel framework for the global prudential regulation of banks. And progress has been made across all three pillars of the prudential framework: regulation, supervision and disclosures. On the topic of disclosures, late last year the BCBS issued a consultation paper on a proposed climate-related disclosure requirements framework, building on the work done in various other fora. The deadline for comments was two weeks ago and we are now carefully assessing the feedback received.
Meanwhile, there is also progress on nature-related risks. In view of the Brazilian G20 Presidency’s priority to deepen work on sustainability-related risk, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will this year complement its climate-related work with a stocktake of current and planned regulatory and supervisory initiatives regarding nature-related financial risks. This may build on the work already done by the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Last year the NGFS – which has 138 members worldwide, including the Banco Central do Brasil – published a conceptual framework to guide action by central banks and supervisors in the area of nature-related risks.
The work currently being done by the BCBS, the FSB and the NGFS will ultimately find its way to other international standard-setting bodies and translate into concrete practices by individual central banks and supervisors.
Let me give you some examples of actions we have taken at the ECB.
In 2021 we unveiled an ambitious climate action plan covering macroeconomic modelling, financial stability monitoring, data collection, risk assessment capabilities and our monetary policy operations. Many of the actions we planned have now been delivered. For instance, we have made significant progress in improving the models that we use in macroeconomic analysis supporting our monetary policy decisions. Moreover, we have in place a methodology to tilt the purchase of corporate bonds towards issuers with a better climate performance – if we ever need to buy corporate bonds again in the future. In the collateral framework for our lending operations, we only accept assets that comply with the relevant sustainability reporting requirements and we are looking at setting limits on the share of assets issued by entities with a large carbon footprint.
In the area of banking supervision, we have urged banks to ensure the sound management of climate and nature-related risks, using the supervisory expectations we published in 2020 as a starting point. These expectations give guidance on how banks should integrate climate and nature-related risks into their strategy, governance and risk management. It is very much consistent with the general supervisory principles that have been established by the BCBS.
Since the ECB first started discussing climate and nature-related risks with banks back in 2019, progress has undoubtedly been made. Banks have taken steps to integrate these risks into their strategy, governance and risk management. Although at present none of the banks under our supervision fully meets all our expectations, each of our expectations has already been fulfilled by at least one bank. It shows that progress is possible, and that it is not just taking place among a few banks, but across the board. This is good news, since we expect all banks under our supervision to be fully aligned with our supervisory expectations by the end of 2024. We will enforce this final deadline as well as several interim deadlines. In fact, a number of banks under our supervision have already received binding requirements to remedy shortcomings by a certain date. If they do not comply, they will have to pay a penalty for every day that the shortcomings remain unresolved.
Building on the results achieved and progress made, earlier this year the ECB announced a new climate and nature action plan. It sets out concrete steps to consider how, within our mandate, we can further support the green transition, assess the physical impacts of climate change and explore the materiality of nature-related risks. Moreover, when we completed a review of our operational framework for implementing monetary policy two weeks ago, we announced that climate change-related considerations will be incorporated into the design of future structural monetary policy operations.
Let me conclude.
The Amazon river is subject to the “Pororoca”, one of the largest tidal bores in the world. It is an enormous wave travelling from the mouth of the Amazon on the Atlantic coast up to 800 kilometres upstream.
The climate and nature crises are unfolding. Together they are overflowing the economy and the financial system, very much like the “Pororoca” overflows the Amazon basin. Even if mitigation and adaptation measures are taken, one thing is certain: the world, the global economy and the financial system will see profound change.
In the words of Brazilian author Paulo Coelho: “You drown not from plunging into the water, but from staying submerged in it.”Emerging from the climate and nature crises requires action from all authorities within their mandate. For central banks and supervisors, this means taking climate and nature into account in the pursuit of their monetary policy and supervisory objectives. If they failed to do so, they would be failing on their mandate. The work that we are doing individually and collectively proves that we will not allow this to happen.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an event organised by the House of the Euro and the Centre for European Reform
Brussels, 27 March 2024
It is a pleasure to be here today.
In recent years, the euro area economy has experienced a series of overlapping demand and supply shocks, which resulted in persistently high inflation.
Due to its dependence on imports hit by those shocks, the euro area also suffered a negative terms-of-trade shock. This acted as an external tax on euro area income that, in practice, was initially absorbed mostly by workers in the form of lower real wages.
The reversal of these negative supply shocks, combined with our restrictive monetary policy, has led to a broad-based decline in inflation, while inflation expectations remain well anchored. This, in turn, has shifted the discussion towards the timing, pace and extent of the reduction in monetary policy restriction going forward.
Our decisions continue to be informed by the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it.[1]One important aspect relates to the risk that wage and productivity growth might be inconsistent with the convergence of inflation to our medium-term target of 2%.
Certainly, in asteady-statescenario, keeping wage rises in line with productivity growth and the inflation target is necessary. It prevents unsustainable cost pressures, which firms would have to pass on to customers, resulting in above-target inflation.
But we are not in a steady-state scenario yet. Real wages are still below their pre-pandemic level – even more so than productivity – while unit profit growth has until recently been high relative to the historical average.Today, the share of labour in value added remains lower than before the COVID-19 shock, despite the level of employment increasing by 3.8% in the same period.[2]
Profits are now normalising, while the ongoing reversal of negative supply shocks creates additional room for a catch-up in real wages that will contribute to the economic recovery consistent with our staff projections and with a convergence to our inflation target.
Indeed, in the projections, this catch-up is a condition for the increase in private consumption. But even at the end of the projection horizon, real wages are still expected to be slightly below the level that would be justified by labour productivity growth since the pandemic.
Just as real wage growth cannot be sustained over time if it continuously overshoots productivity growth, output and productivity growth are unlikely to be sustained over time if wages and domestic demand remain permanently depressed. This may lead to a protracted underutilisation of resources, with potential output eventually adjusting downwards to meet depressed demand.
Let me be clear: wage growth needs to moderate over the medium term for a sustained convergence of inflation to our target. But an excessive focus on short-term wage developments may not take into full consideration the recovery in wages that can – and needs to – take place for the euro area’s currently fragile recovery to gain a stronger footing. If the economy does not recover, this would mechanically put downward pressure on productivity growth or on employment.
Today, the process of disinflation is surrounded by less uncertainty as supply shocks reverse and risks to the inflation outlook have balanced out. We are increasingly confident that inflation will converge to 2% by mid-2025.
Waiting for further data before starting the normalisation of our policy rates, gives us additional insurance against upside risks to inflation. But we should remain proportionate going forward given an economy that has stagnated for 18 months, risks to the economic outlook that are skewed to the downside, and credit conditions that are in restrictive territory.
If incoming data confirm the scenario foreseen in the March projections, we should stand ready to swiftly dial back our restrictive monetary policy stance. Increased confidence in a timely return of inflation to our target should then allow forward-looking information to regain prominence in our reaction function.
The rise and fall of inflation in the euro area
Headline inflation in the euro area increased to record levels following a string of unprecedented and intersecting demand and supply shocks, with the latter playing the primary role (Chart 1).[3]
In particular, energy inflation, already at elevated levels, soared to above 40% year on year in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Headline inflation became increasingly broad-based as high energy costs spread throughout the economy, driving food and services prices higher – albeit with lagged effects (Chart 2).
Given Europe’s reliance on energy imports, soaring energy prices also constituted a negative terms-of-trade shock for the euro area (Chart 3)[4], which acted as an external tax on income that had to be collectively absorbed by labour and capital. In practice, however, it was real wagesthat initially absorbed most of this tax. They declined markedly in 2022[5]and remained below their pre-pandemic level at the end of last year (Chart 4).
Supported by a tight labour market in the euro area, workers have sought higher nominal wage growth, initially to reduce real income losses and subsequently to recoup them.[6]But wage growth remained slightly below inflation in 2023 and is only expected to exceed it in 2024.[7]
By contrast, in an environment of high and volatile inflation, firms were better able to increase selling prices and secure high unit profit growth. Evidence suggests that the frequency with which firms revised prices upwards increased considerably during the high-inflation period in comparison with the pre-pandemic era.[8]
As a result, in 2022 alone unit profits accounted for roughly two-thirds of domestic inflation in the euro area (as measured by the GDP deflator), well above the historical average of around one-third.[9]Accordingly, there has been a reduction in the share of wages in value added, in spite of higher employment, and an increase in the share of profits compared with the years before the pandemic (see Chart 5).
In response to high inflation, the ECB adjusted its monetary policy. We undertook ten consecutive policy rate increases, amounting to a cumulative 450 basis points – the sharpest adjustment in our history.[10]
In parallel, we further advanced the normalisation of the Eurosystem balance sheet, which had already been underway since December 2021. The normalisation has been playing out at a faster pace than in other parts of the world (Chart 6).[11]
Over the course of the past year, two developments have helped to pave the way for a sharp decline in inflation and to keep medium-term inflation expectations anchored around our target.[12]
First, supply shocks are unwinding.
Energy inflation, formerly the main driver of rising prices, has been negative in the past ten months.[13]Together with the ongoing easing of pipeline pressures and the relaxation of supply bottlenecks, this has supported disinflation in the other HICP components. In particular, food inflation and goods inflation have tumbled by around three-quarters from their respective peaks.
Services inflation has so far eased less than other components, falling 1.6 percentage points from its peak to 4.0% and remaining well above its historical average. This slower disinflation in the services sector reflects the lagging nature of services inflation, mirroring what we saw when inflation was on the rise, and is consistent with past experience.[14]
At the same time, most underlying inflation measures have fallen in the past year, ranging between 2.1% and 4.5% in February, with forward-looking indicators[15]being at the low end and domestic inflation at the high end (Chart 7).[16]
The second development strongly contributing to the disinflation process has been the ECB’s restrictive monetary policy stance.
There is clear evidence that monetary policy restriction is being strongly transmitted to lending conditions in the euro area economy. Since the start of the tightening cycle, bank lending rates to firms and to households for house purchases have gone up by about 370 basis points and 210 basis points respectively. Moreover, annual loan growth over the same period has declined from 6% to 0.2% for firms and from 4.7% to 0.3% for households. The stagnant loan flows have been the result of both demand and supply forces, as indicated by the substantial cumulative tightening since 2022 in the ECB bank lending survey (BLS). The demand for loans by firms and households declined, driven by higher interest rates and lower investment (Chart 8). And bank credit standards tightened, as a result of higher perceived risks and lower risk tolerance (Chart 9).[17]
The restrictive stance of our monetary policy has contributed to the stagnation of euro area real GDP in the last six quarters. Given that monetary policy operates with a lag, it will continue to exert a negative impact on economic activity, with growth projected to remain anaemic in the first quarter of 2024.
In particular, private consumption in the euro area has been subdued. Euro area retail sales were broadly unchanged at the start of the year, pointing to continued weak dynamics in spending on goods, and consumer confidence remains below its long-term average (Chart 10).
Weak domestic demand and the unwinding of supply shocks are reflected in the current account balance, which returned to surplus last year. This surplus is projected to increase further to 3.2% of GDP in 2024 and stay at that level subsequently. This points to domestic savings continuing to significantly exceed subdued demand for investment over the entire projection horizon.
Moreover, the euro area fiscal stance[18]is projected to further tighten in 2024 and in the following years, notably on account of the new fiscal rules and the continued withdrawal of support measures adopted in response to the energy shock. Overall, fiscal policy has been more restrained in the euro area than in other major economies (Chart 11).
Lacklustre demand has repercussions on economic activity. The latest European Commission business survey cites insufficient demand as the most common factor limiting production. In fact, this constraint has been on the rise, just as other factors – including labour shortages – have been receding (Chart 12). Industrial production was flat in the fourth quarter of 2023, decreased strongly in January and remains well below its pre-pandemic level (Chart 13).
Coupled with restrictive financing conditions, weaker than expected economic activity was reflected in the downward revision of euro area growth for 2024 to 0.6% in the latest ECB staff projections. But as inflation continues to decline and households’ real disposable income increases, we expect a recovery to ensue, with the economy growing at 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.
Should we be worried about wage growth?
As supply shocks continue to unwind, labour costs have become a prominent driver of domestic inflation pressures, leading to concern that they could delay the convergence of inflation to our target.
This concern stems from the observation that nominal wage growth has recently exceeded the sum of target inflation and productivity growth. Alongside the catch-up process in nominal wage growth, this has reflected a cyclical decline in productivity owing to lacklustre economic growth, compounded by firms’ hoarding of labour. As a result, unit labour costs have been growing significantly above a level that in normal times we would consider consistent with our inflation target (Chart 14).
The worry is that this could keep inflation high if these costs are passed on to consumers – in particular in wage-intensive sectors such as services, which account for the largest part of the euro area economy.[19]This could ultimately lead to inflation that is persistently above target.
ECB staff analysis suggests that a 1 percentage point increase in wages pushes up core inflation by around 0.5 percentage points.[20]This pass-through, however, is subject to substantial uncertainty and takes time to fully materialise.[21]It depends on the nature of the shock, the stage in the business cycle and the sector in question, calling for a cautious approach to interpretating the impact of current wage dynamics on inflation.
While concerns about unit labour costs need to be taken seriously, there are grounds to argue that the current economic environment allows for a recovery in real wages in the short term that will not fuel inflation, provided real wage increases gradually come into line with productivity growth. I would like to highlight three factors in particular.
First, cumulative real wage developments have been even weaker than productivity growth since the onset of the pandemic (Chart 15). As at the end of 2023 real wages were still below their level at the end of 2019, while productivity was roughly the same. This creates some room for a non-inflationary recovery in real wages.
Second, the reversal of supply shocks provides room for a non-inflationary increase in real wages. In particular, the substantial decline in energy prices and intermediate input costs creates a buffer for firms to absorb wage pressures such that they are not passed on to consumer prices.
Third, there is room for a rebalancing of the shares of wages and profits in value added. In an environment of high and volatile inflation – in which price signals become blurred and consumers cannot easily separate price hikes that are due to cost increases from those that reflect market power and opportunistic strategies – firms were able to increase selling prices, securing higher profit margins at a time when the euro area’s terms of trade deteriorated. This created room to now buffer higher wage growth with profit margins. Indeed, firms expect labour costs to rise more than selling prices (Chart 16). This is consistent with an environment of dampened demand, in which firms expect to be unable to continue raising prices without losing market share.
For these reasons, the ECB staff projections foresee that a catch-up of wages in real terms, especially in 2024, is compatible with reaching our target in a timely fashion. Thereafter, the projections expect real wages to continue to moderate, before reaching a level consistent with projected productivity growth and our inflation target in 2026.
In fact, there are signs that nominal wage dynamics in the euro area already peaked in the middle of last year (Chart 17). And in the fourth quarter of 2023, annual growth in compensation per employee declined to 4.6% from 5.1% in the previous quarter. Quarter-on-quarter growth also notably declined, to 0.9% from 1.4% in the previous quarter.
While we must continue to carefully monitor the risks associated with wage growth that would exceed the projections, we also need to consider the symmetric risk associated with weaker than expected growth in wages. The failure of real wages to recover over the short term may have unintended effects.
First, it may slow the cyclical recovery and hence productivity growth, putting upward pressure on unit labour costs. The decline in real wages in the last two years, combined with higher financing costs, has reduced the price of labour relative to capital and other inputs such as energy. This disincentivises investment in capital-intensive sectors, such as industry, which tend to have a higher level of productivity. And it incentivises the continued hoarding of labour, further weighing on labour productivity.[22]
Second, lower real wages have been accompanied by markedly lower consumer spending on goods vis-à-vis other categories (Charts 18 and 19) as budget-constrained households delay goods consumption.[23]This further reinforces a sectoral shift towards sectors with lower levels of productivity and fuels consumption of items such as services, which have experienced less disinflation.
Third, by straining households’ balance sheets, lower than projected real wages would make financing conditions tighter than intended – increasing the risk of non-linear implications for the economy.
Households have been facing increasing borrowing constraints since the start of the tightening cycle. In particular, evidence suggests that low-income households – which have a higher propensity to consume – are experiencing more difficulties in meeting their mortgage payments and accessing credit compared with high-income households (Chart 20). The lowest-income quintiles of households are also those with the smallest accumulated excess savings to fall back on during periods of financial strain (Chart 21).
Looking beyond the short term, if real wages do not recover, this would increase the risk of protracted economic weakness, which could cause scarring effects, as investment and supply capacity adjust to persistently low demand. This would reduce potential output, over time bringing down the level at which demand becomes inflationary. And it would further dent productivity in the euro area relative to other parts of the world.
Monetary policy and the disinflation process
In the current environment, calibrating monetary policy requires a careful balancing act between ensuring that inflation converges to our target in a timely manner – especially given the prolonged period of high inflation – and remaining proportionate in terms of insuring ourselves against upside risks to inflation, given the associated economic costs.
Our interest rate decisions should remain based on our reaction function, which is determined by the assessment of the inflation outlook in the light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. At the same time, the relative weights of these components may evolve[24]to reflect a more forward-looking orientation as our confidence in the timely convergence of inflation to our target grows.
Accordingly, paying attention to wages should not result in giving undue prominence to a factor that, while permeating all measures of observed and underlying inflation, is not the only determinant of cost pressures. The cost of intermediate inputs and profit margins, for instance, also matter.
The current environment of disinflation means that the outlook is surrounded by less uncertainty as supply shocks unwind. We are becoming more confident in the projections. Indeed, the accuracy of staff projections for inflation has significantly improved in the past year[25], and the risks to the inflation outlook have balanced out.
Our staff projections in March pointed to the convergence of headline and core inflation to our target. We now expect inflation to average 2.3% in 2024, 2.0% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. The projections for inflation excluding energy and food have also been revised downwards and average 2.6% for 2024, 2.1% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026.
At our Governing Council meeting earlier this month, we decided to wait for further data – notably in relation to wages and profits – before starting the normalisation of our policy rates in order to have further assurance that inflation is converging to our target.
Since that meeting, data have shown that the growth in compensation per employee moderated in the fourth quarter of 2023, in fact more than we had projected. And to date, evidence from the forward-looking wage tracker for 2024 does not suggest significant upside risks to the projections (Chart 22).
Thus, while we should carefully monitor incoming data, wage growth appears on track to gradually moderate in the medium term towards levels that are consistent with our inflation target and productivity growth, in line with the projections.
And as inflation declines, our current monetary policy stance becomes tighter relative to the inflation outlook. This gives us additional insurance against upside risks to inflation but, as our confidence in the timely convergence of inflation to our target grows, it also strengthens the case for adjusting our policy rates.[26]If we hold them for too long, we might put the recovery at risk and delay the associated cyclical rebound in productivity growth. This would be economically costly and induce risks for the sustained convergence of inflation to our target.
In calibrating our future decisions on the path towards a less restrictive stance, we should be guided by the progress made towards our medium-term target.
On the one hand, if we see that the process of disinflation and the impact of monetary policy are weaker than expected, we can slow down and remain restrictive for longer. This is because even after initial cuts to our policy rates, we would remain well above the range of available estimates of the neutral rate of interest.[27]
On the other hand, a faster process of convergence towards our inflation target and a stronger than expected impact of monetary policy would allow us to normalise our policy rates at a faster pace.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Inflation is declining, and a recovery from a protracted period of stagnation is on the horizon. As we become more convinced that the disinflation is sufficiently advanced, we must give the recovery a chance.The unwinding of supply shocks means that lower inflation and higher growth can be achieved simultaneously.This makes it possible for the economy to switch to a faster lane without endangering the disinflation process. Allowing the recovery to proceed will create the conditions for a more favourable disinflation path that is compatible with a sustained convergence to our inflation target.
In turn, this means that there is scope for wages to rebound in the short term. In fact, this is one of the key conditions envisaged in the projections for the recovery to materialise, for productivity growth to pick up, and for both to be sustained. But as economic conditions normalise, wage growth should gradually moderate over the medium term to be consistent with trend productivity growth and our inflation target.
The improving inflation outlook, continued strong transmission and further moderation in inflation all create scope for more confidence that we can dial back restriction. We are coming closer to the point when we will have the confidence to act.
Thank you."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at The ECB and its Watchers XXIV Conference session on: Geopolitics and Structural Change: Implications for Real Activity, Inflation and Monetary Policy
Frankfurt, 20 March 2024
Over the past two years, we have seen a measurable and persistent rise in real interest rates across many advanced economies, partly reversing the secular decline that started in the early 1980s.
This increase in real rates has reignited the debate among academics and policymakers about the level of the natural rate of interest, or r*, the real short-term interest rate that would prevail if the economy was operating at its potential and inflation was at target.
The question is whether the recent reversal is a sign that real interest rates will remain higher once the impact of recent shocks has faded, or whether they will return to the lows seen in the pre-pandemic era.
In my remarks today, I will discuss two hypotheses that can help explain the fall and rise in real interest rates.
Thesavings-investment hypothesisargues that structural determinants of global saving and investment are the ultimate drivers of the natural rate of interest, and hence real long-term rates, which are anchored around r*.
According to this hypothesis, the persistent decline in real long-term rates in the pre-pandemic era was the result of a combination of low investment at times of globally declining productivity growth, high savings due to an ageing population, and a high demand for safe assets in response to global currency and financial crises.
Themonetary policy hypothesisargues that monetary policy may have played a role in the persistent downward trend and subsequent rise in real interest rates.
Since r* is a theoretical construct that is unobservable, and the economy’s long-run evolution is surrounded by considerable uncertainty, financial markets often look to the central bank for informing and coordinating their views about real long-term interest rates. By providing long-run guidance, the central bank may influence long-term interest rates.
To the extent that the signal inferred from central banks has an impact on private consumption and investment decisions, it may even result in informational feedback loops, inducing shifts in r*.
The implications of these two hypotheses for the role of monetary policy are quite different. While in the first case, monetary policy merely responds to global structural changes, in the second, it may have long-lasting effects on economic activity.
The fall and rise in real interest rates
In the decades following the inflation spikes of the 1970s and early 1980s, we have observed a gradual and persistent decline in real short- and long-term risk-free interest rates globally (Slide 2).
Model estimates show that r*, too, has followed a persistent downward trend over the past decades leading up to the pandemic, even if there is some disagreement about its precise level given high model and estimation uncertainty (Slide 3).[1]
This co-movement is not surprising. If real long-term rates are driven by fundamental forces, then they should align closely with r* over the long run, once the impact of temporary demand or supply shocks has faded and the economy has moved back into equilibrium.[2]In other words, r* serves as an anchor for real long-term rates.
Over the past two years, however, this downward trend seems to have reversed. Real long-term yields have increased considerably across advanced economies.
This rise has not just been driven by an increase in spot short-term rates due to the highly synchronised global monetary policy response to the inflation surge. It also reflects a reassessment by market participants of the expected level of real short-term interest rates prevailing in the future.
For example, respondents to the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) expect the ECB’s deposit facility rate (DFR) to level off in a range between 2% and 2.5% over the long run (Slide 4, left-hand side). Given an expected inflation rate of 2% over the same horizon, this would correspond to an r* of 0% to 0.5%. The ECB’s model-based estimates have shown a similar upward trend (Slide 4, right-hand side).[3]
These estimates are around one percentage point higher than before the start of the monetary policy tightening cycle in December 2021, when median survey expectations and model estimates of real short-term rates were in negative territory.
Market-based proxies of r* in the euro area have also increased measurably since late 2021 (Slide 5, left-hand side). The shift is even more pronounced in the United States where market participants price an expected average real short-term rate of above 1% over the long run, substantially higher than in 2021 (Slide 5, right-hand side).
The savings-investment hypothesis
So, what factors can help explain these developments in real long-term rates and r*?
One explanation is offered by thesavings-investment hypothesis.
Within a standard macroeconomic framework, changes in equilibrium real interest rates are determined by structural shifts in savings and investments.[4]An increase in desired investment, for a given level of desired savings, puts upward pressure on real interest rates (Slide 6, left-hand side).
In a world with free capital flows, real interest rates are determined globally, in line with the remarkable co-movement across major advanced economies.[5]Over the long run and without any frictions in financial markets that prevent capital from moving freely across borders, there exists a single equilibrium interest rate that clears the global capital market.[6]
Global r* thus acts as an anchor for domestic r*.
Proponents of the savings-investment hypothesis have put forward two main factors by way of explaining the fall in r*, and hence real long-term rates, in the pre-pandemic era.
The first is the trend decline in productivity growth, which lowered the marginal return on capital, and thus the demand for investment.[7]
A second key driver was a persistent rise in savings – what Ben Bernanke called the “global saving glut”.[8]Large current account surpluses in emerging market economies with shallow financial markets and a series of currency and financial crises led to a rise in savings, exerting downward pressure on r*.[9]
Higher risk aversion after the global financial crisis, together with demographic forces, such as a higher life expectancy and longer retirement, further contributed to an increase in desired savings.[10]
Recent research indeed suggests that the bulk of the decline in global r* since the 1970s can be attributed to slowing productivity growth and rising longevity (Slide 6, right-hand side).[11]
The savings-investment hypothesis can reconcile the marked divergence in views about the likely persistence of the recent rise in real rates.
To see this, it is useful to think about the natural rate as having two components: a very slow-moving long-run component and a more cyclical component that can drive the natural rate away from its long-run trend over a protracted period.
This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that real interest rates have oscillated around a persistent downward trend since the start of the Renaissance in the 14thcentury (Slide 7).[12]
Temporary but protracted reversals in the interest rate regime happened at times of major and persistent structural shocks, such as the Black Death in the 1350s or extended periods of war.
After the Second World War, for example, major investment was needed to reconstruct the European and parts of the global economy, which put upward pressure on r* over several decades until it started to decline in the 1980s (Slide 8).[13]
Today, the situation may be similar.
It is possible that the fundamental forces driving our economies in the long run have not changed, despite the series of shocks we have witnessed in recent years.[14]As such, an ageing global population and continued subdued productivity growth may remain a drag on real interest rates.
At the same time, overcoming the challenges we are currently facing may ultimately require changes to our economy that are large enough to offset these fundamental forces over the coming years, and possibly beyond.
Specifically, climate change and the green transition, geopolitical shifts due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and tensions between the United States and China, as well as rapid advances in artificial intelligence and digitalisation will require exceptionally high investment.
The transformation towards a climate- and nature-preserving economy may in itself necessitate investments comparable to what was required to rebuild the European economy after the Second World War.[15]
According to estimates by the European Commission, annual investment in the energy system in the 2020s needs to be twice as high as in the preceding decade if we want to meet the objectives of the Fit for 55 package.[16]
In addition, the higher frequency of extreme weather events is likely to necessitate extensive public and private investments for both rebuilding and adaptation.[17]In the United States, the number of billion-dollar disasters has risen exponentially, from just three on average in the 1980s to 28 in 2023 (Slide 9, left-hand side).[18]
Moreover, benefiting from the rapid advances in artificial intelligence and exploiting the full potential of digitalisation will require large public and private sector investments in physical and human capital for acquiring and implementing new technologies and reshaping business processes.
Such investments will be particularly large in the EU, which has been lagging the United States and China markedly over the past years (Slide 9, right-hand side).[19]
Finally, companies that seek to make their supply chains more resilient by diversifying their sourcing strategies will generate another major push towards higher investment.
According to an ECB survey, leading firms operating in the euro area expect to become much more active in near-shoring or friend-shoring operations over the next five years to make their businesses more resilient (Slide 10, left-hand side).
Geopolitical risks and climate change are seen as the two most important factors for relocating production and business operations to the EU. Such relocation could unleash a new wave of capital investment in physical infrastructure (Slide 10, right-hand side).[20]
Considering that part of these massive overall investment needs will be government-financed, and that, in the new geopolitical situation, defence spending may have to be significantly stepped up, public debt burdens are likely to rise.[21]Furthermore, ageing societies may put an additional burden on public budgets.
Higher net issuance, in turn, may face a shrinking supply of global savings, as a gradual retreat in globalisation may reduce current account surpluses.[22],[23]
Overall, therefore, investors’ anticipation of higher private and public investment needs may have put upward pressure on real long-term rates, potentially marking the beginning of yet another protracted period of r* deviating from its long-run trend.[24]
The monetary policy hypothesis
The second key explanation of the trends of real interest rates suggests that monetary policy itself may play an important role for real long-term interest rates.
This hypothesis starts from the observation that, despite its theoretical appeal, there has been little evidence of a stable relationship between real interest rates and standard proxies of the key determinants of savings and investment across subsamples over the past 150 years.[25]
Some key factors, such as demographics or productivity, have the expected relationship with real interest rates in some subsamples but not in others (Slide 11).
Taking an even longer perspective over several centuries casts more fundamental doubt on the conventional wisdom that the decline in global real rates can primarily be explained by productivity trends: the persistent increase in total factor productivity growth after the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century coincided with adownwardtrend in real rates.[26]
The view that monetary policy may help explain these deviations, at least temporarily, is not new.   Over the past two decades the literature has studied extensively whether and how monetary policy can have long-lasting effects on real interest rates, going in different directions.[27]
On the one hand, overly tight monetary policy may lower investment and technological growth.[28]On the other hand, persistently expansionary monetary policy may lead to the build-up of financial imbalances and contribute to zombification, reducing potential growth.[29]
However, the most recent literature has added an interesting twist to the debate, arguing that the most important channel of monetary policy relates to central bank communication.
Recent research documents that the descent in US real long-term yields over the past decades can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings(Slide 12).[30]Outside these time windows, changes to real long-term interest rates have been short-lived.
According to this study, long-run forward guidance, as expressed by the dot plots, appears to have lowered real bond yields by around 130 basis points over the last decade.
New research by ECB staff corroborates these findings. It shows that a 100 basis point US monetary policy shock has historically been associated with a 30 basis points increase in r* over the long run.[31]
As monetary policy is thought to be neutral over the long run, these findings are puzzling. At a deeper level, however, they may not necessarily be at odds with the savings-investment hypothesis.
Even if financial markets may ultimately look to the central bank for information about the long-run evolution of the economy, the thinking behind central bank communication may still be guided by models built on the interactions between savings and investment.
In any case, these studies suggest that the recent rise in real long-term rates may be partly due to financial market participants interpreting the policy tightening, as well as recent central bank communication, as a shift in policymakers’ beliefs about the level of r*.
In other words, the impact of monetary policy actions and communication may be stronger than conventionally assumed.
This would also imply that central banks have little to learn about the natural rate of interest from looking at market pricing, as we may just be looking in the mirror.
Taking this argument further, central banks’ shaping investors’ beliefs about r* may even result in informational feedback loops. For example, easing monetary policy could be seen as signaling a lower r*, inducing firms and households to become less optimistic about the economy.[32]
This could negatively affect output and inflation insofar as it influences spending decisions. The central bank may then cut rates even further, validating private sector beliefs and weakening the expansionary effects of the policy rate easing.
In this interpretation, the inability of central banks in the pre-pandemic period to bring inflation back to target may partly have been due to self-reinforcing dynamics. If monetary policy easing during that period was interpreted as containing adverse information about the long-run state of the economy, the contractionary effects of the resulting feedback loops may have contributed to persistent declines in r*.
Conclusion
To conclude, protracted reversals in real interest rates have occurred repeatedly in history in the aftermath of large economic, political or social shocks.
We may now be facing such a turning point. The exceptional investment needs arising from structural challenges related to the climate transition, the digital transformation and geopolitical shifts may have a persistent positive impact on the natural rate of interest.
Whether the anticipation of these investment needs has directly been driving real rates higher in recent years, or whether monetary policy has been a catalyst for the repricing, remains subject to discussion.
It is possible, however, that the determined monetary policy response to the inflation burst may have shifted market participants’ beliefs about r*, thereby making a return of secular stagnation less likely.
That said, the uncertainty about how central bank actions and communication affect real long-term rates suggests that policymakers need to tread carefully. Rather than looking to financial markets, which could just be a mirror of ourselves, we need to thoroughly examine whether the fundamental forces driving the economy over the long run have changed, and communicate these views prudently.
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at The ECB and its Watchers XXIV Conference, organised by the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main
Frankfurt am Main, 20 March 2024
Since the pandemic, monetary policymakers have been facing an exceptionally complex environment. As inflation rose, we were confronted with profound uncertainty about how far it would go and how widely it would spread across the economy. And even as inflation has eased, uncertainty about its persistence has remained.
The potential costs of mis-calibrating policy have been high, which is why we had to employ a policy framework that minimises the risk of mistakes. And we have done so by building our reaction function around three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission.
Though we conceived these criteria when we had low visibility of future inflation, they have also helped guide our decisions as inflation has fallen and forecasts have become more accurate.
As Marie Curie once said, to thrive through the ups and down of life, “we must have perseverance and above all confidence”. And our framework has indeed encouraged us to persevere when necessary and to build up confidence when needed.
It has served as a reliable compass for calibrating policy through three phases of our current policy cycle.
First, it helped create robustness during our tightening phase when we were devising how far we needed to go to rein in inflation.
Second, it has helped us practice patience during the holding phase until the signals from our inflation projections and underlying inflation are more consistent.
Third, it will support us in building up sufficient confidence to begin the dialling-back phase in which we make policy less restrictive.
The tightening phase
In the early phase of our tightening cycle, our main priority amid surging inflation rates was to exit our accommodative policy stance as quickly as possible. While the policy challenge was immense, the policy path was relatively simple to calibrate.
But as rates rose and approached restrictive territory, calibrating our policy stance became more complex. We first had to assess how much rates needed to rise until they were sufficiently restrictive, and then for how long they needed to stay at that level. But our assessment was blurred by much lower than normal visibility of the future.
Our forecasts repeatedly underpredicted inflation by large margins, even at shorter horizons. From 2021 to 2022 for example, the absolute inflation forecast errors in the staff macroeconomic projections, one quarter ahead, more than doubled, largely owing to volatile energy prices.[1]
At the same time, the mix of shocks that emerged from the pandemic and its aftermath – rotations in spending, energy spikes, “bullwhip” cycles in manufacturing, supply bottlenecks, tight labour markets, fiscal expansion and reopening effects – heightened the risk of inflation becoming more persistent.
We faced a highly unusual conjuncture of high inflation and declining real wages, but also rising employment. This combination essentially implied a multi-year catch-up process to make up for real wage losses. In turn, this process could have triggered what I referred to at last year’s conference as a “tit-for-tat” inflation dynamic.[2]
And we faced uncertainty as to how quickly and forcefully our monetary policy response would succeed in bringing down inflation. The ECB had not been through a tightening cycle for more than a decade, and there were reasons to believe that the transmission of monetary policy to firms and households might have changed.[3]
So, to calibrate policy accurately, we needed a framework for policy decisions that would work when we had low visibility and would mitigate heightened uncertainty. This is why we built our monetary policy response around the three criteria I referred to earlier: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission.
This approach made our decisions more robust, as the inflation path we foresaw in our projections had to be validated by data we could observe in real time and extrapolate into the medium term. That, in turn, enabled us to take forward-looking decisions with a higher degree of confidence.
And it served us well in practice.
The three criteria helped us to map out the remaining climb, allowing us to bring rates to sufficiently restrictive levels to break the persistence of inflation.[4]But also, by guiding us to carefully evaluate the strength of policy transmission, they acted as a cross-check against overtightening. This helped us reach the decision to stop rate hikes after last September.
The holding phase
We then entered the current phase of our policy cycle – the holding phase – during which we committed to keep rates at restrictive levels for as long as necessary.
Since the start of this phase, inflation has been declining consistently and our projections have been showing inflation returning to our target over the medium term. We now project inflation to average 2.3% in 2024, which is 0.4 percentage points less than projected in December and 0.9 percentage points less than September. We then expect inflation to decline to 2.0% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026.
And unlike in the earlier phases of our policy cycle, there are reasons to believe that the expected disinflationary path will continue.
First, for some time now inflation outturns have been broadly in line with our expectations. In 2023 we saw a reduction of about 70% in the average absolute error in our staff projections relative to 2022, one quarter ahead.
Second, we now see inflation returning to 2% earlier in our projection horizon than before, in mid-2025, and not exceeding our target for the remainder of the horizon.
Third, the composition of inflation is improving, as we now expect lower core inflation in the medium term. This suggests that the convergence to 2% is likely to be more durable and less beholden to assumptions about commodity prices, although the latter can always prove hazardous.
The other criteria are also becoming more consistent with this improved inflation outlook.
The transmission of our monetary policy is unfolding in the right direction. Financing conditions have reacted strongly to higher rates, loan demand has weakened and, in turn, activity has slowed notably in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.
And underlying inflation is generally easing. Nearly all the measures that we track are declining, and the range of readings between the different measures has narrowed from 4.1 percentage points at its peak to 2.4 percentage points today. Some of the measures of underlying inflation with the best leading indicator properties for future inflation have dropped steeply.[5]
But, at the same time, domestic price pressures remain strong.
Services inflation is still stubborn and hovering around 4%, while momentum increased somewhat in February. And our indicator of domestic inflation, which measures items with a low import content, stands at 4.5%, at the top of the range of underlying inflation measures that we monitor. This measure has also been found to have good leading indicator properties.[6]
These pressures largely reflect robust wage growth as the catch-up process continues, as well as a tight labour market that has so far been resilient to a slowing economy. Employment grew by two million cumulatively during 2023, even as the economy stagnated, while firms continue to hoard labour. This pattern is mechanically lowering labour productivity and pushing up unit labour costs.
At this stage, it is difficult to assess whether these price pressures simply reflect the lag in wages and services prices and the procyclical nature of productivity, or whether they signal persistent inflationary pressures.
So, although we have made significant progress in all three of our framework criteria, we are not yet sufficiently confident that we are on a sustainable path towards our inflation target.
Building sufficient confidence to dial back policy
So the essential question is: what do we need to see to become sufficiently confident to start dialling back our restrictive policy stance?
Put simply, we need to move further along the disinflationary path. And there are three domestic factors that will be decisive to ensuring that the inflation path evolves as we project.
The first of these is wage growth.
Our forecast sees nominal wages slowing to 3% over the next three years, allowing real wages to fully catch up to pre-pandemic levels over the projection horizon, also including productivity gains.[7]But with the unemployment rate expected to remain very low at 6.6%, this wage path cannot be taken for granted. Sensitivity analysis by ECB staff shows that if there were an earlier full catch-up by the end of this year, inflation would rise to 3% in 2025 and only fall to 2.5% in 2026.[8]
The second is profit margins.
The compression of profit margins has allowed wages to catch up without further accelerating inflation. Unit profits accounted for more than 50% of the GDP deflator in the last quarter of 2022 but this figure fell to just 20% a year later. But our sensitivity analysis shows that, if firms were to regain pricing power as the economy recovers and profit margins were to rise by an accumulated 1 percentage point more than we project until the end of 2026, inflation would be 2.7% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026.
The third factor is productivity growth.
We expect that a pick-up in demand, if accommodated by fully utilising hoarded labour, will lead to rising productivity growth and falling unit labour costs. We project labour productivity growth of 0.1% this year before it rises to 1.2% in 2025 and 2026. But the path of inflation could be different if, in a new geopolitical environment, productivity losses for European firms turn out to be partly structural.
Given the delays with which these data become available, we cannot wait until we have all the relevant information. To do so could risk being too late in adjusting policy. But in the coming months, we expect to have two important pieces of evidence that could raise our confidence level sufficiently for a first policy move.
First, we will have more data to confirm whether wages are indeed growing in a way that is compatible with inflation reaching our target sustainably by mid-2025.
The latest data point in this direction. Growth in compensation per employee edged down to 4.6% in the fourth quarter of last year – slightly below our March projection – from 5.1% in the third quarter. Negotiated wage growth, which accounts for the lion’s share of compensation per employee growth, also decreased from 4.7% to 4.5% in the fourth quarter.
Similarly, the ECB’s forward-looking wage tracker, which anticipates the development of negotiated wage growth in the euro area, is showing early signs that pressure is easing. Average wage growth in 2024 for all existing wage contracts[9]fell from 4.4% at the time of our January Governing Council meeting to 4.2% at the time of our meeting in March.
The coming months will help us form an even clearer picture.
We will receive data on negotiated wage growth in the first quarter of this year at the end of May.And many wage negotiations are currently taking place in large sectors, the outcome of which will be entered into our wage tracker as soon as the negotiations are concluded. Employees whose contracts ran out last year and have not been renewed, or will run out by March 2024, account for around one-third of those in our wage tracker.
Second, by June we will have a new set of projections that will confirm whether the inflation path we foresaw in our March forecast remains valid. These projections will also implicitly give us more insight into the path of underlying inflation. We will have more visibility on the strength of the recovery and the likely direction of the labour market, and therefore on the consequences for wages, profits and productivity.
In addition, we will have had a longer window to assess whether inflation data continue to fall broadly in line with our projections. If they do, we can be more confident that our models are now better accurately capturing inflation dynamics. And this confirmation will be particularly important for the more persistent components, such as services, so that we can trust these components will continue to decline in keeping with their typical lagging pattern.
If these data reveal a sufficient degree of alignment between the path of underlying inflation and our projections, and assuming transmission remains strong, we will be able to move into the dialling back phase of our policy cycle and make policy less restrictive.
But thereafter, domestic price pressures will still be visible. We expect services inflation, for example, to remain elevated for most of this year. So, there will be a period ahead where we need to confirm on an ongoing basis that the incoming data supports our inflation outlook.
This has two important implications for the policy path ahead.
First, our decisions will have to remain data dependent and meeting-by-meeting, responding to new information as it comes in. This implies that, even after the first rate cut, we cannot pre-commit to a particular rate path.
Second, our policy framework will remain important to process the incoming data and calibrate the appropriate policy stance. At the same time, the relative weights assigned to the three criteria will have to be regularly examined.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
I said after our last Governing Council meeting that, when it comes to the data that is relevant for our policy decisions, we will know a bit more by April and a lot more by June. I hope that my remarks today help you to better understand our analysis and logic.
In the coming months, we will receive more data, which will help us to assess whether we are sufficiently confident in the path ahead to move to the next phase of our policy cycle."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting
Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024
Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.
Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate.
As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR.
More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.
As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).
While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3).
Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]
In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2]This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment.
Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation
Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25 years ago.
Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]
By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5).
Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.
The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4]This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]
A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6]Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]
The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.
In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).
The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral.
With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.
For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).
At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70 basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.
In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR.
The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system.
One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side).
This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]
A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]
While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]
A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).
As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce.
These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11).
Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11]For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]
The operational framework: principles and characteristics
The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]
Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity.
Our operational framework has three key characteristics.
The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, themarginalunit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral.
Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.
Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]
As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]
Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample.
A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]
With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.
Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.
Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]
A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.
In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.
While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]
So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area.
A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.
The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves.
A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union.
Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]
As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity.
At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.
But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.
Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements.
In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.
The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change.
The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.
The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years.
Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile.
In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25 basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September.
The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.
Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25 basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework.
The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR.
A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.
The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.
The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20]But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy.
These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.
Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.
Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21]In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem.
A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure.
At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy.
In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]
Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).
Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23]It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity.
A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.
If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.
If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.
Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves.
That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.
Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.
Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance.
The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off.
With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy.
Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle.
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the plenary session of the European Parliament
Strasbourg, 26 February 2024
As we approach the end of this legislative term, I wish to sincerely thank this Parliament for collaborating in guiding Europe through economic headwinds and geopolitical upheavals, always with the shared vision of bolstering prosperity and fortifying our resilience.
Building on this collaborative spirit, today’s debate on your draft resolution on the ECB Annual Report is a pillar of the ongoing dialogue between our two institutions; indeed, it is fundamental to the ECB’s accountability which ensures the democratic legitimacy of our actions.
Let me start by outlining the current state of the euro area economy and our monetary policy stance. I will then focus on the need for a common European response to strengthen euro area resilience and competitiveness.
Bringing inflation back to target in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment
The euro area has been facing significant headwinds from a series of sudden and consecutive shocks which pushed inflation very high in the wake of the post-pandemic recovery. Having peaked at 10.6% in October 2022, inflation has since declined significantly thanks to the unwinding of energy shocks and various supply-side disruptions along with determined policy action.
After expanding by 3.4% in 2022, euro area economic activity has been weak in 2023, with real GDP growth having stagnated in the final quarter. Subdued demand for euro area exports – owing mainly to weaknesses in global trade and earlier losses in competitiveness – and tight financing conditions are weighing on growth. Weakness in manufacturing activity has been extending to the services sector since the end of 2023. However, there are increasing signs of a bottoming-out and some forward-looking indicators point to a pick-up later this year.
Despite the sluggish economy, the labour market has remained resilient. Unemployment stood at a historical low of 6.4% in December amid robust demand for labour, which is, however, showing some signs of weakening.
Inflation decreased slightly to 2.8% in January. Energy prices declined by 6.1%, and food inflation, while still elevated, came down further to 5.6%, primarily reflecting a lower inflation rate for processed food.
Core inflation – excluding energy and food price developments – also decreased further to 3.3%, reflecting lower inflation in goods, while services inflation remained more persistent.
Wage pressures, meanwhile, remain strong. Wage growth is expected to become an increasingly important driver of inflation dynamics in the coming quarters, reflecting employee demand for inflation compensation and tight labour markets. At the same time, the contribution of profits – which has recently accounted for much of the increase in domestic cost pressures – is declining, suggesting that, as expected, labour cost increases are partly buffered by profits and are not being fully passed on to consumers.
Regarding your concerns about the risks of second-round effects, as mentioned in your draft resolution, let me emphasise that our restrictive monetary policy stance, the ensuing strong decline in headline inflation and firmly anchored longer-term inflation expectations act as a safeguard against a sustained wage-price spiral.
Looking forward, we expect inflation to continue slowing down, as the impact of past upward shocks fades and tight financing conditions help to push down inflation.
This brings me to our current monetary policy stance.
At our January Governing Council meeting, we considered that the incoming information was broadly in line with our December assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. We therefore decided to keep our key policy interest rates unchanged.
These interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to ensuring that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The current disinflationary process is expected to continue, but the Governing Council needs to be confident that it will lead us sustainably to our 2% target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, taking into account the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Building euro area resilience in turbulent times
The shifting economic and geopolitical landscape calls for strengthening the euro area’s resilience.
As you note in your draft resolution, high energy prices and increased geopolitical instability are posing a threat to euro area competitiveness. And they are adding to Europe’s existing structural challenges such as ageing, climate change and digitalisation.
To maintain monetary sovereignty and economic prosperity in these challenging times, it is essential for Europe to build up resilience to shocks and invest in its strategic autonomy.
A unified European policy response should strive to unlock Europe’spotential, focusing on progress in three key dimensions:independence,investmentandintegration.
First, we need to make progress on energyindependence.
Given its proximity to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Europe was hit particularly hard by its dependence on energy imports from Russia. To reduce the bloc’s vulnerability to global shocks, improvements in energy security, efficiency and affordability will be vital. European firms’ ability to compete globally will hinge on being less energy dependent.
As energy security becomes imperative, Europe will need to boost the roll-out of renewables by increasing investment in clean energy and green technologies, such as green hydrogen and smart energy grids.
But the path to greater energy independence also entails considerable investment needs.
This brings me to my second point: we need to fosterinvestment.
The European Commission estimates that an extra €620 billion per year will be needed to finance Europe’s environmental and climate objectives, while an additional €125 billion will be required for the digital transition.[1]But making these investments, as well as addressing shortcomings in the functioning of the financial system, requires further progress on deepening our Economic and Monetary Union, something you highlight in your draft resolution.
Faithfully implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework will help ensure that fiscal rules reduce high government debt and promote structural reforms and productive public investment, including for the green and digital transitions. I am pleased that EU policymakers, including this Parliament, have recently reached a provisional agreement on the new framework, which should be swiftly and diligently implemented. This will be essential to enhance credibility and anchor expectations about the future course of fiscal policies.
Completing Europe’s capital markets union (CMU) will also be key in financing the twin transition. A fully functioning CMU is needed to foster private financing and complement public investment. We are currently underperforming in this area. Our capital markets remain fragmented and, as a result, lack depth and liquidity, especially when compared with those of the United States. Let me give two examples. First, the EU trading landscape is characterised by many small exchanges, with three times as many exchange groups as in the United States and more than ten times as many exchanges for listings.[2]Second, EU venture capital, relative to the size of the economy, is only a small fraction of the size – around one-fifth – of US venture capital.[3]Measures to promote equity financing would provide an opportunity to broaden European firms’ financing options for investing in the technologies needed for the twin transition.
Europe’s competitiveness and ability to invest also hinge on further progress being made towards banking union. A complete banking union would support more integrated banking services across the euro area and strengthen the global competitiveness of our banking sector.
Finally, the third key dimension of a unified European response is the need for deeperintegrationof our Single Market to strengthen Europe’s overall competitiveness and resilience.
The Single Market remains incomplete. But it is essential for Europe’s long-term competitiveness.[4]
A more integrated Single Market would help unleash Europe’s growth potential, boosting our shared prosperity. Measures to strengthen the Single Market could, for example, focus on reducing red tape and excessive regulation, both at EU and national levels. This would provide incentives to invest and innovate, as 61% of EU firms consider business regulations to be an obstacle to investment.[5]In addition, a more competitive and integrated electricity market is also crucial for completing the Single Market and supporting the green and digital transitions. The digital transition would also be further supported by a digital euro.
Progress in this direction would support cross-border trade, investment, and growth. It would also enhance innovation through increased incentives for research and development. The impact of such progress would be considerable – ECB analysis shows that the Single Market raised the region’s GDP per capita by 12% to 22% between 1993 and 2008.[6]
A more integrated Single Market would also strengthen our resilience. We now know that Europe’s heavy reliance on external demand and global supply chains can be a weakness. We should therefore leverage and further exploit the full scale of our internal market for goods and services. This will require comprehensive reform, but it has the potential to re-establish the Single Market as an engine of growth, innovation and competitiveness.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Europe has demonstrated its ability to navigate turbulent times. In the face of the current economic and geopolitical challenges, policymakers must be bold enough to take the further steps needed to advance European integration.
As Simone Veil remarked in her inaugural speech as President of the European Parliament here in a plenary session 45 years ago: “If the challenges facing Europe are to be met, we need a Europe capable of solidarity, of independence, and of cooperation.” Her words resonate strongly today. We must seize the opportunity to bolster Europe’s unity and resilience.
I count on this Parliament – and the next one – to drive the decisive European action needed to strengthen the euro area.
The ECB will continue to play its part, within its mandate. Let me reiterate our unwavering commitment to delivering on price stability, while contributing to the topics I have talked about today and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with you, the elected representatives of EU citizens.
Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to listening to your views during today’s debate."

Inaugural lecture of the EMU Lab by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the European University Institute
Florence, 16 February 2024
More than 30 years after its inception, Economic and Monetary Union is widely seen as a success. It has steadily gained support among Europeans. Nearly 80% of euro area citizens support the single currency.[1]
This is a strong vote of confidence, which shows that the euro is more than a currency. Our monetary union has become a global leader in social protection, a pioneer in fighting climate change and a guardian of free trade and democracy.
But these values and achievements are being increasingly questioned and challenged in a world that is becoming less open, less stable and less reliable.[2]To assert its role, the euro area needs to remain competitive; it must be capable of creating the sustainable growth that our social and economic fabric depends on.
However, this capability is increasingly under threat. At the turn of the millennium, Europe was operating at the global technological frontier, but today many euro area firms are laggards. Compared with many of their global peers, they invest less in both physical capital and research and development, and they are less productive.
Today I will explain the factors behind the euro area’s competitiveness crisis and propose remedies to address its deeper root causes.
I will argue that our most potent weapon for enabling European firms to catch up to the technological frontier is to eliminate the remaining barriers to the free movement of goods, services and capital in the European Union. European firms would then be able to compete and thrive in an environment of disruptive technological change where the “winner takes most”.
Europe’s lost IT revolution
Europe looks back on a long history of innovation and fundamental transformation.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, the discoveries of Nicolaus Copernicus and Isaac Newton marked watershed moments for social and scientific progress. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the rise of industrial Europe laid the foundations for modern society and the ensuing significant improvements in the standard of living.
After World War II, Europe once again became the world’s engine of productivity growth. In the four largest economies in the euro area, the ratio of labour productivity compared with that of the United States increased rapidly, soaring from 25% in 1945 to 100% in 1995 and thereby closing the productivity gap with the United States (Slide 2, left-hand side).[3]
These gains were widely shared across euro area economies, reflecting the fast integration in trade and finance in the run-up to the establishment of the EU’s Single Market, with new technologies spreading rapidly across borders (Slide 2, right-hand side).[4]
So, going into the 21st century, Europe was operating at the global productivity frontier.[5]Productivity growth was slowing over time, but that was to be expected as the distance to the frontier narrowed. But in the following years, the euro area took a different course and fell behind other economies like the United States.
Between 1995 and 2007, annual growth in GDP per hour surged measurably in the United States, whereas it slowed and diverged in the euro area. By the time of the global financial crisis in 2008, euro area economies had accumulated productivity losses of some 20% relative to the United States, with the productivity ratio falling back to 0.8.
The euro area has not been able to recover from this loss of competitiveness. Productivity growth has remained subdued, a development reinforced more recently by the repercussions of the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.
The dismal trajectory of Europe’s productivity has been subject to much analysis. Most economists agree that European firms’ failure to reap the efficiency gains brought about by information and communication technologies – or ICT for short – is one of the root causes.[6]This shows up in both the capital stock and total factor productivity.
Over the past three decades, a striking gap in the real IT-related capital stock has emerged between the euro area and the United States (Slide 3).[7]Broad-based investments in ICT fundamentally transformed the US economy, especially the services sector, as ICT became a general purpose technology which radically changed the way many firms operated and served their customers.[8]
As a result, annual productivity growth in the services sector in the United States increased by 3.2% on average between 1995 and 2005, compared with just 0.9% in Europe.[9]
But even in the United States, the productivity boost driven by the ICT boom proved temporary. Since the global financial crisis, productivity growth has been subdued across advanced economies, despite continued rapid technological change, including the rise of generative artificial intelligence (Slide 4).
The potential causes of this slowdown have been discussed intensively and controversially. Some argue that the most recent technological innovations are simply less revolutionary than earlier inventions, such as the railway, electricity or the telephone.[10]
Others claim that we have yet to see the full benefits of AI and other cutting-edge technologies, as history shows that technology adoption rates can be slow.[11]In 1987 Robert Solow famously remarked that computers were everywhere except in productivity statistics.[12]
Empirical evidence supports this second hypothesis. It finds that although technologies developed at the global frontier are spreadingacrosscountries ever faster, they are spreading to all firmswithinan economy ever more slowly.[13]
Slow technology diffusion is also at the core of why firms in the euro area have failed to benefit from the ICT revolution.
Two explanations have been identified in the literature.
One is that the business environment in the United States made it easier, or more pressing, for firms to invest in ICT.
Despite important progress on reforms in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, product and labour markets in the euro area often remain heavily regulated.[14]For example, many euro area countries set higher administrative requirements for start-ups than other advanced economies.[15]
High barriers to entry protect the rents of incumbents, reduce technology diffusion and constrain the entry of younger firms, which are more likely to innovate.[16]
In the euro area, younger firms that survive are on average almost three times as productive as their older peers (Slide 5, left-hand side).[17]Most of this gap can be explained by young “superstar” firms, which increase their productivity on average by around 100% per year. These firms invest more than their competitors, particularly in intangible assets, such as software and databases, and they use fewer and more specialised workers (Slide 5, right-hand side).
The link between firm demography, technology diffusion and productivity growth can be seen in the manufacturing sector in particular. The marked decline in productivity growth of high-tech frontier firms in this sector during the past decade coincided with a measurable slowdown in business dynamism (Slide 6, left-hand side).[18]
Today, the average age of a high-tech frontier firm in the manufacturing sector is about 50% higher than it was before the global financial crisis, and about twice as high as that of their peers in the services sector (Slide 6, right-hand side). This lack of “creative destruction” is often associated with a lower level of innovation activity.[19]
Empirical evidence also shows that firm size is an important factor driving investments in ICT, as the fixed costs related to process reorganisation weigh particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises.[20]
However, higher administrative requirements may prevent younger firms from expanding. In France, for example, several labour laws only become binding when a firm exceeds the 50-employee threshold.[21]
Such requirements have made it harder for euro area firms to grow to a sufficient size. In the United States, firms with more than 250 employees account for almost 60% of total employment (Slide 7). In the euro area, the share is between 12 and 37%.
Similarly, the lack of external capital often makes it difficult for firms to scale up. In the euro area, venture capital investments are much lower than in the United States, so that many innovative companies hit funding constraints once they have entered the growth phase.[22]This may lead them to relocate to places where funding is more readily available and capital markets are deeper.
Having young firms that are highly productive, while displaying low productivity at country level means that a large part of our available resources is stuck in corners of our economies that are comparatively less productive.
A large body of empirical evidence suggests, however, that broader business conditions have not been the only impediment to ICT-related productivity growth in the euro area.
A look at US multinationals doing business in Europe illustrates this well.[23]These firms have significantly higher productivity gains from IT than their European peers, despite facing the same regulatory environment. This seems to be because US firms consistently score higher in people management practices.
The “US management hypothesis” rests on the observation that IT adoption requires complementary changes in a firm’s organisation to reap the productivity gains of digital technologies.[24]
That is, as the price of IT equipment falls and computational capacity rises, improvements in productivity mainly depend on skilled people using data, software and new procedures that leverage these technologies.
The experience of police departments in the United States is a good example.[25]Higher IT investment alone had no statistically significant effect on reductions in crime rates or increases in clearance. However, when IT adoption was complemented by the introduction of CompStat – a management system created by the New York City Police Department – crime rates fell and clearance rates rose.
The evidence from the euro area confirms these patterns.
Research by ECB staff shows that only about 30% of firms, those closest to the technology frontier, manage to use digital technologies in ways that raise productivity over time (Slide 8, left-hand side).[26]For most firms, investment in ICT has no significant impact on their efficiency.
In other words, digital technologies require a large stock of human and managerial capital. In many euro area countries, however, a significant share of adults – in some cases more than a third – have not completed upper secondary school (Slide 8, right-hand side). Such gaps in the education system can help explain why many firms have not been able to reap the benefits of the ICT revolution so far.
Why Europe urgently needs to tackle its competitiveness crisis
Closing the euro area’s technology gap has become more urgent than ever.
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is weighing heavily on the price competitiveness of euro area firms. Today, electricity prices in the industrial sector in the EU are almost three times as high as in the United States and more than twice as high as in China (Slide 9, left-hand side).
As a result, the production of high energy-intensive goods is declining at a concerning pace, undermining the euro area’s stronghold in traditional industries (Slide 9, right-hand side).
Energy from fossil fuels is bound to become even more expensive over time as carbon prices rise. This implies that the only way to sustainably regain competitiveness is to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels by accelerating the green transition.
However, since high carbon-intensive sectors, such as mining, refineries and air transport, have so far been on average more productive than greener ones, the reallocation of production factors across sectors during the green transition will mechanically reduce aggregate productivity over the short run.[27]
Boosting technology adoption in less carbon-intensive sectors could help offset some of these effects. And by raising wages and reducing inflation, this could also secure public support for the green transition.
Domestic headwinds are further aggravating the euro area’s productivity malaise. Three of them are particularly relevant.
First, the euro area is facing demographic change of unprecedented magnitude. Based on the latest population projections by Eurostat, the old-age dependency ratio − that is the number of people aged 65 or above relative to those of working age (20 to 64) − is expected to increase on average from 37% in 2022 to 60% in 2070 (Slide 10, left-hand side).
The rapid ageing of our society coincides with a shift in preferences, as more and more people prefer to work fewer hours. Average hours worked per employee have been on a secular downward trend since the 1970s, mostly reflecting a decline in the number of hours employees desire to work (Slide 10, right-hand side).[28]
With fewer working-age adults working fewer hours per each elderly person, output per hour worked needs to increase for our social system to remain sustainable.
Second, as productivity gains from digitalisation remain confined to a few highly innovative and productive firms, we are seeing a concerning trend in market concentration.
Recent estimates by ECB staff suggest that while the median price mark-up of firms has remained broadly unchanged over the past two decades, the upper tail of the mark-up distribution has increased considerably (Slide 11, left-hand side).[29]
Such “winner-takes-most” dynamics are mainly observed in the services sector, where the productivity gap between frontier and non-frontier firms has been widening rapidly, also because many laggards have failed to exploit the efficiency gains from ICT (Slide 11, right-hand side).
The experience of the United States suggests that the rise of “superstar” firms, such as Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, can have lasting macroeconomic consequences and can help explain several secular trends, including the fall in the labour share of income and the rise in income inequality in the United States.[30]
Moreover, to the extent that some monopoly rents are increasingly earned outside the euro area, such “winner-takes-most” dynamics increase the dependency of domestic firms on third countries for the supply of technology, constraining strategic autonomy.
Third, productivity growth is a key determinant of medium-term inflation and real interest rates, which means it directly affects the conduct of monetary policy.
Over the past year, we have made considerable progress in restoring price stability after the largest inflationary shock in decades (Slide 12, left-hand side). Raising our key interest rates was instrumental in curbing high loan growth that risked entrenching the adverse cost-push shocks that the euro area economy had faced since 2020.[31]
But persistently low, and recently even negative, productivity growth exacerbates the effects that the current strong growth in nominal wages has on unit labour costs for firms (Slide 12, right-hand side). This increases the risk that firms may pass higher wage costs on to consumers, which could delay inflation returning to our 2% target.
In this environment, monetary policy needs to remain restrictive until we can be confident that inflation will sustainably return to our medium-term target. The recent long period of high inflation suggests that, to avoid being forced into adopting a stop-and-go policy akin to that of the 1970s, we must be cautious not to adjust our policy stance prematurely.
Measures that help firms boost productivity growth directly support monetary policy in achieving its objective of securing price stability over the medium term.[32]
Such measures would also expand the future policy space for central banks if faced with new disinflationary shocks. This is because higher productivity growth pushes up the marginal product of capital and hence the neutral real interest rate r*, which is the interest rate at which monetary policy is neither expansionary nor restrictive.[33]
New estimates show that an increase in trend productivity growth by one percentage point can increaser* by 0.6 percentage points.[34]A higher r* would reduce the need to embark on unconventional policy measures that often come with larger side effects.[35]
How to boost productivity?
How, then, can we solve the euro area’s competitiveness crisis?
My diagnosis of the problem suggests that aggregate productivity growth depends both on how technologies are used and advanced at the firm level – the management hypothesis – and on how resources are allocated across firms – in other words the broad business environment.[36]
There are important interactions between these two factors. A slower technology diffusion across firms, as suggested by the divergence of productivity between frontier and laggard firms, boosts the gains that arise from reducing an inefficient allocation of resources.[37]
These gains are estimated to be significant in the euro area.[38]In Italy, for example, it is estimated that aggregate productivity in the manufacturing sector would be around 15% higher if national frontier firms were as large as the global frontier benchmark (Slide 13).[39]
If these firms were empowered to scale up, aggregate productivity growth could rise significantly. This is what happened in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. Research shows that a substantial part of productivity growth in manufacturing during this period can be explained by output shifting from less productive to more productive firms.[40]
The European Commission recently presented concrete action points for improving competitiveness in the euro area, and it is working towards a regulatory framework for enhancing growth.[41]In addition, Mario Draghi is expected to deliver a comprehensive report on the EU’s competitiveness later this year.
From a euro area perspective, I see three mutually reinforcing factors as critical for reducing resource misallocation and for promoting and easing the diffusion of digital technologies in the euro area.
First, we need a regulatory framework that more strongly embraces and encourages competition.
There is broad evidence showing that strict product market regulations, rigid labour markets and excessive red tape have significantly inhibited the adoption of digital technologies in the past.[42]
Since the euro area sovereign debt crisis, many governments have made measurable progress in making their economies more flexible and less rigid.[43]However, the momentum of reform slowed notably after 2012.
In an environment of rapid technological change, this slowdown has made existing regulation more costly, as the impact of regulations on economic activity is highly state-dependent.
For example, competition policies are typically less important in countries that are far away from the global technological frontier. During the 1960s and 1970s Europe was able to catch up with the United States despite lower business dynamics.[44]
In today’s digital world, however, competition matters significantly more than it did in the 20th century. Research shows that stronger competition is associated with significant improvements in managerial ability, which we have seen is a key ingredient in reaping the benefits of digitalisation.[45]
To kickstart this virtuous circle, the cost of firm entry and expansion as well as the cost of closing a failing business need to be reduced. For example, in the euro area it takes, on average, more than twice as long as in the United States – two years instead of one – for creditors to recover what they are owed after a company defaults.
Bolstering the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction has become even more important after the pandemic, as government support schemes have led to fewer firms exiting the market than during previous crises, although this process has started to reverse.
Second, we need to foster integration in the euro area.
Firms operating in larger markets can more easily build economies of scale and tend to be more innovative.[46]The single market is our strongest weapon for combining our economic weight and allowing European firms to compete and thrive in an environment where the “winner takes most”.[47]
However, the level of European integration, especially in the area of market services, which account for around 70% of the EU’s GDP, remains disappointing. Intra-EU trade in services accounts for only about 15% of GDP compared with more than 50% for goods (Slide 14, left-hand side).
Similarly, only 25% of large firms offer cross-border online sales in the EU. For small and medium-sized enterprises, the share is below 10%. To a significant extent, this reflects remaining regulatory and administrative barriers restricting cross-border trade in services, with little if any progress having been made in addressing this in recent years.
Our financial markets also remain segmented along national borders. Financial integration in the euro area has not increased from where it stood in the early years of monetary union. This contributes to capital misallocation and reduces the potential for cross-border risk sharing (Slide 14, right-hand side).
Research shows that deeper and more integrated capital markets could measurably boost diffusion of technology: increasing access to capital can reduce the distance from the technological frontier by 5 to7 %.[48]
ECB President Christine Lagarde recently laid out how important timely progress towards a true capital markets union is for succeeding in the ongoing green and digital transitions.[49]Consolidating rules and market infrastructures and reviving the securitisation market would go a long way towards reducing segmentation and improving access to external finance.[50]
Completing banking union is equally important. Banks remain the backbone of our economy. Yet, since the establishment of ECB Banking Supervision in 2014, we have made little progress in creating the conditions for banks to operate freely across borders. Total EU cross-border assets held by banks, especially via subsidiaries, remain far below the level seen before the sovereign debt crisis (Slide 15).
Deepening our banking union requires two additional steps. One is reducing regulatory impediments that continue to hinder cross-border consolidation and competition. These impediments include fragmented tax and insolvency regimes and limited cross-border fungibility of capital and liquidity within a single banking group as a result of ring-fencing measures by national competent authorities.
As it takes time for such obstacles to be removed, a faster means of achieving this goal would be for banks to rely more extensively on branches instead of providing services through subsidiaries. In this regard, ECB Banking Supervision has already brought forward important suggestions for facilitating the use of branches.[51]
Further steps are completing the ratification of the amendment of the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism and creating a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). Regrettably, national sovereign safety nets remain the ultimate backstop for banks. This cements the sovereign-bank nexus that led the euro area into a deep crisis more than ten years ago.
Progress on risk sharing through EDIS needs to be accompanied by stronger market discipline to mitigate adverse incentives and make risk sharing more politically palatable.[52]Therefore, risk sharing and market discipline should be advanced in parallel.
Third, we need to raise public investment, both at national and European levels, in order to deal with pressing structural challenges: the green transition, territorial security, digitalisation and a growing shortage of skilled workers.
Complementarities between public and private investments mean that capital deepening by firms alone will not be sufficient to overcome the euro area’s competitiveness crisis.[53]
Public investment has been weak in the euro area for a long time. After the sovereign debt crisis, a visible gap in public investment opened between the euro area and the United States (Slide 16, left-hand side).[54]
Against this background, the ECB welcomes the recent agreement in the European Parliament and the Council on a new economic governance framework that attempts to balance the need to ensure debt sustainability against incentives for investments and structural reforms. The latter are essential for raising productivity and economic growth, and therefore also vital in supporting debt sustainability.
Now governments must take full ownership of the new rules. Besides consolidation efforts, this means meeting the reform and investment commitments made in their national Recovery and Resilience Plans, which are at the heart of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme.[55]
NGEU can play a significant role in overcoming the euro area’s competitiveness crisis, as it allocates most of its funding to public investment, including in education and training.[56]For the euro area, financial support offered by national Recovery and Resilience Plans amounts to €513 billion, or almost 4.1% of euro area GDP.[57]
Estimates by ECB staff suggest that NGEU has the potential to measurably boost productivity growth over the coming years (Slide 16, right-hand side). However, this requires full implementation of previous commitments.
Reforms and investments are being actively pursued across the EU. By the third quarter of 2023, around 500 reform-related milestones and targets had been assessed as satisfactorily fulfilled (Slide 17).[58]
At the same time, despite a significant catch-up in December last year, the latest evidence points to some backloading in the implementation of investment plans. For the euro area aggregate, the latest estimates by ECB staff indicate a cumulative shortfall over the period 2021-2023 of around 4% in relation to the total funding that was initially available.[59]
Next week, the European Commission will publish an independent evaluation report on the progress made on implementing investment plans so far. The delays highlight two potential areas for reflection on the way the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) is designed.
One is the administrative burden. The RRF regulation requires Member States to set up an effective control and audit system. Such a system is important for protecting the EU’s financial interests, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this system poses a considerable challenge for national administrations which has led to delays in payment requests. It is a trade-off that requires reassessment.
The other area for reflection relates to NGEU’s ambitious horizon: all funds need to be tapped by 2026 the latest. While we have no time to lose when it comes to stimulating productivity and fighting climate change, rushing the implementation of investment projects could translate into supply bottlenecks, unwarranted demand-driven inflationary pressures and the risk of selecting “easy-to-fulfil” projects that favour government consumption over investment.
These issues demand attentive contemplation, as we cannot allow NGEU to fail. The stakes are simply too high, also for the ECB.
With NGEU, the euro area temporarily addressed three important gaps in its institutional architecture: (i) it set up a central fiscal tool to provide stabilisation through common resources, which supports monetary policy; (ii) it led to closer integration in economic policymaking by coordinating strategic investment decisions at the European level; and (iii) it increased the liquidity of EU bonds and it deepened euro area capital markets, thus making progress towards the creation of a truly European safe asset.[60]
How effectively governments use the NGEU funds to make our economies fit for the challenges we face will therefore critically define the future path of European integration.
Successful implementation of NGEU presents a unique opportunity to boost productivity, lay the groundwork for completing the euro area’s institutional architecture and make monetary policy more effective.
Conclusions
Let me conclude.
Nobel laureate Paul Krugman once noted “Productivity isn't everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything.”[61]European leaders recognised this already more than 20 years ago when they signed the Lisbon strategy. But progress has so far been disappointing.
Growing economic nationalism, threats to our territorial security and a rising technology gap between ours and other advanced economies make the case for boosting the euro area’s competitiveness ever more urgent. The responses to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine demonstrate that Europe is able to pull together when faced with adversity.
Turning from laggard to leader requires initiating a virtuous circle between public and private investment on the one hand and productivity growth on the other. This starts with full implementation of previous commitments under the Recovery and Resilience Facility. Priority must be given to measures that strengthen competition, reduce bureaucracy and stimulate further integration in product, labour and financial markets.
These measures will help channel capital and labour towards their most productive uses, challenging incumbents and removing barriers that are holding back young productive firms from growing to their full potential.
And, importantly, Europe leading the way on productivity also helps the ECB maintain price stability.
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 15 February 2024
Today’s hearing is our last before the end of this legislative term.
Let me therefore start by thanking you all sincerely for the constructive dialogue we have had over the past years.
This legislative term has been shaped by crises – from the COVID-19 pandemic to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the energy crisis and renewed conflict in the Middle East. These challenges have required EU institutions, within our respective mandates, to take decisive action and to coordinate closely across policy areas to ensure that Europe emerges stronger and better prepared for the future.
Importantly, our two institutions have also used the past term to deepen our accountability relationship, which is essential for the ECB’s democratic legitimacy.
In my remarks today, I will first update you on our latest assessment of the economic outlook and the ECB’s recent monetary policy decisions. I will then reflect upon the first 25 years of the euro, which you have selected as the topic for this hearing.
After expanding by 3.4% in 2022, euro area economic activity has been weak in 2023, with real GDP growth having stagnated in the final quarter. Weakness in activity is broad-based across sectors, extending from construction and manufacturing to services.
Incoming data continue to signal subdued activity in the near term. However, some forward-looking survey indicators point to a pick-up in the year ahead.
According to the latest flash estimate, inflation edged down to 2.8% in January 2024 after increasing by a half percentage point in December. The rebound in December had been widely expected but was weaker than anticipated. The increase reflected base effects in the energy component due to one-off gas price support measures in Germany and a sizeable drop in fuel prices in December 2022. Food inflation eased further to 5.7% in January due to a lower inflation rate for processed food, while energy inflation stood at -6.3%.
Core inflation (excluding energy and food) is declining gradually but its services component has shown signs of persistence.
Wage growth continues to be strong and is expected to become an increasingly important driver of inflation dynamics in the coming quarters, reflecting tight labour markets and workers’ demands for inflation compensation.
The ECB’s forward-looking wage tracker continues to signal strong wage pressures, but agreements indicate some levelling offin the last quarter of 2023. Wage pressures for 2024 hinge particularly on the outcome of ongoing or upcoming negotiation rounds that affect a large share of euro area employees. The contribution of unit profits to domestic price pressures continued to decline, suggesting that, as expected, wage increases are at least in part buffered by profit margins.
Overall, the latest data confirm the ongoing disinflation process and is expected to bring us gradually further down over 2024 as the impact of past upward shocks fades and tight financing conditions help to push down inflation.
At our January Governing Council meeting, we considered that the incoming information was broadly in line with our December assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. We therefore decided to keep our key policy interest rates unchanged.
These interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to ensuring that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The current disinflationary process is expected to continue, but the Governing Council needs to be confident that it will lead us sustainably to our 2% target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, taking into account the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Let me now turn to the topic of this hearing – the euro at 25, the youngest of the international reserve currencies.
While still young, the euro has nonetheless matured and become an indispensable part of our daily lives.
Its journey from the dream of a few visionary founders to a currency used by 350 million people across 20 countries is testimony to the power and impact of the European project.
During its first decade, its childhood so to speak, the focus was on establishing the credibility of the ECB as a new central bank and of the euro as a new currency.
Its second decade, its youth, was characterised by the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis, which led to concerted European efforts to strengthen the architecture of Economic and Monetary Union, including the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.
The third decade, its early 20s, has been shaped by challenges posed by the pandemic, climate change, geopolitical tensions, and the need to avoid high inflation becoming entrenched. These shocks have highlighted the necessity for new European tools to accelerate the green and digital transitions and to enhance Europe’s energy independence and overall resilience.
As a constant companion, the euro connects us all and offers three key benefits: simplicity, stability and sovereignty.
Simplicitybecause it can be used by consumers and firms throughout the euro area without having to exchange currency, making it easy to live, travel and do business there. This is also reflected in the widespread support for the euro, with 79% of euro area citizens in favour of the single currency.[1]
Stabilitybecause, despite recent fluctuations and price shocks, inflation in the euro area has averaged 2.1% since 1999 and, more importantly, longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly anchored around the ECB’s target. This is a testimony to the ECB’s credibility.
Sovereigntybecause the euro is the second most important global currency. It is used in international transactions and therefore protects euro area consumers and firms from currency fluctuations in an increasingly turbulent world.
The euro has delivered in all these areas and repeatedly demonstrated its resilience and reliability in the face of significant challenges.
This Parliament has played a pivotal role in strengthening the euro’s foundations over the years, not least during this last legislative term. Your work to set up Next Generation EU, reform the economic governance framework, deepen the capital markets union and the banking union, design the legal framework for a digital euro and address climate change has laid the foundations that will ensure that the euro is fit for the future.
The ECB has also played its part and demonstrated its commitment to deliver on its mandate in a constantly changing environment.
As a reminder, let me highlight three ways we have done so in recent years.
First, we have remained unwavering in our commitment to our primary mandate of price stability, responding forcefully to the surge in inflation following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis.
Second, we have taken steps to incorporate climate change considerations into our monetary policy operations and in so doing, play our part in contributing to meeting the objectives set out in the Paris Agreement, within our mandate. Our announcement in January reaffirmed and expanded our work on climate change and nature degradation in both our monetary policy and supervisory activities, placing a particular focus on the green transition, the physical impact of climate change, and the nature-related risks for the economy and the financial system.[2]
Third, we are making progress in developing a digital euro, which would strengthen our strategic autonomy and support our competitiveness in a digitalised world. You discussed this important topic with Mr Cipollone yesterday and I would like to thank you all for the close cooperation on this topic over the past few years.
As we look ahead to the next 25 years of the euro, I can assure you that the ECB will continue to engage closely with the European Parliament, respond to new challenges and constantly review its actions to ensure it can continue to deliver on its mandate.
Let me now conclude.
The first 25 years of the euro have been a success, but our work is not done. Economic and Monetary Union is not an end point – each European generation must write its own chapter of the single currency’s history.
With a new geopolitical landscape emerging, the reasons for strengthening our common currency are stronger than ever.
As Goethe once wrote ""What is not started today is never finished tomorrow"".
The upcoming European elections will be a chance to set out a new, ambitious agenda to further deepen our Economic and Monetary Union. It is essential that all policymakers grasp this opportunity to ensure that Europe can respond to the common challenges we are facing.
Thank you for your attention. I am now ready to take your questions."

Introductory statement by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 14 February 2024
Thank you for the opportunity to speak before the Committee today. As I emphasised during my confirmation hearing, I am committed to actively pursuing the dialogue with the European Parliament on a digital euro.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the euro and our monetary union. It is up to us to ensure both remain fit for the digital age. The Single Currency Package[1]will help us achieve just that: first, by ensuring cash remains widely accessible and accepted; and second, by complementing cash with a digital option for paying with central bank money.
A digital euro would be a European means of payment which could be used free of charge, for any digital payment, anywhere in the euro area. Together with cash, a digital euro would preserve European citizens’ freedom to use a public means of payment.
Yet, we are at risk of taking this freedom for granted. In my previous role, I received countless letters from mayors of communities – in mountainous regions for instance – who expressed concerns about increasingly long distances to the nearest ATM.
Cash and a digital euro have the same objective: ensuring that everyone, regardless of their income, can pay in any situation of daily life. This is a fundamental right. And it should be protected in the same way in all parts of the euro area.
This is a timely moment to discuss a digital euro. As co-legislators, you are currently debating the European Commission’s legislative proposal, while the Eurosystem initiated the digital euro preparation phase last November.[2]
Your legislative deliberations frame our technical work, and they will continue to do so. The Eurosystem stands ready to provide technical input to European co-legislators as needed. Let me assure you that the ECB’s Governing Council will not take any decision about the issuance of a digital euro until the legislative act has been adopted. This constitutes the framework within which the digital euro will be established as legal tender. We will of course remain fully accountable at all times and will keep you continuously and closely informed about the Eurosystem’s progress towards a digital euro,not just at this stage but also after the legislative deliberations have concluded.
Let me now update you on four key issuesthat are central to our preparation phase: i) search for possible providers to develop a digital euro platform and infrastructure; ii) preparing the digital euro rulebook; iii) ensuring the stability of the financial system; and iv) last but not least, offering a higher level of privacy when making digital payments.
At the beginning of this year, we started the selection process to find possible providers who could potentially develop a digital euro platform and infrastructure.[3]
Let me be clear: we are not launching any of the development work now. Instead, we want to establish framework agreements that could be used in the coming years to develop the relevant components if the decision to launch the digital euro is taken.[4]We need to be prepared for such an event. Our readiness would be compromised if we started searching for possible suppliers only after that decision is made. However, we are not tying our hands in any way by sourcing potential suppliers now. The agreements will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the legislative deliberations or technological advances. And if we were to take the decision not to launch a digital euro, we would not sign any contracts.
Closer engagement with external providers will provide us with insights into the technological options available and the choices to be made. This is particularly crucial for components that are not yet on the market, such as the offline digital euro functionality.
To strengthen our autonomy, resilience and security, a digital euro would rely on a European infrastructure. Accordingly, only legal entities with registered offices in the EU and controlled by such entities or EU nationals[5]will be eligible to participate in the procurement process.[6]
At this stage, we have issued calls for applications to establish framework agreements with potential providers of digital euro components and related services.
We will publish the outcome of the subsequent public tender process on our website.
There is currently no single European digital means of payment that is universally accepted across the entire euro area. This forces Europeans – consumers, merchants and banks – to rely on ever more expensive international card solutions for daily payment activities. Fees applied by international card schemes almost doubled between 2016 and 2021 in the EU.[7]And even these international card solutions cannot be used everywhere.
A digital euro would remedy this situation, breaking Europe’s long-held dependency and fostering competition. To this end, everyone in the euro area should be able to make or receive payments in digital euro, irrespective of their intermediary or country of origin – as is currently the case for cash.
This is why we need a digital euro rulebook. We are working on a draft rulebook together with representatives of consumers, retailers and intermediaries.[8]We have recently published a report on our progress in this area.[9]
The rulebook will define a single set of rules, standards and procedures for the digital euro that will ensure its harmonious implementation. This will guarantee, for example, that someone from Finland will be able to pay with digital euro as easily and in the same way in Lisbon as they can back home in Helsinki.
A digital euro would thus provide an alternative infrastructure for all day-to-day payments, whichcould be used by payment service providers and schemes, such as the European Payments Initiative, Bizum or Bancomat, to roll out instant payment-based solutions across the euro area. This would reduce our dependence on non-European players while fostering competition among European players.
By analogy: the digital euro infrastructure could be seen as a common European railway, on which different companies can operate their own trains and compete for customerswithout needing to deploy their own private tracks, as is the case with today’s payment system. In addition, private payment service providers could launch new and innovative products or extend their scope beyond existing use cases and domestic markets. This would be a marked improvement on the current situation.
There is a growing public preference for digital payments.[10]But central bank money is, for now, only available in physical form – cash. So, if we do not offer a digital euro, we run the risk that central bank money could be crowded out of payments.
Our objective is to preserve the role and share of central bank money in payments, not to displace private money. As clearly stated in the European Commission’s legislative proposal, preserving the role of central bank money should not come at the expense of other objectives, such as protecting monetary policy transmission or financial stability. And we are in any case bound by these objectives, which are at the heart of the ECB’s mandate.
That is why we have included safeguards in the design of a digital euro.
First, as is the case for euro banknotes, digital euro holdings would not be remunerated and hence would not compete with savings deposits.[11]And banks could always offer higher remuneration to retain deposits. This would benefit savers and could in fact increase the deposit base, supporting bank lending.[12]
Second, there will be limits on the amount of digital euro that can be held by individuals.And whilebusinesses and public sector organisations could receive and process payments in digital euro, they could not hold any.[13]
Third, users couldpay with digital euro online without prefunding their wallets, by seamlessly linking their digital euro account to a payment account with their bank. This would offer them the convenience of being able to make and receive online payments, even above their digital euro funds and the holding limit.[14]However, if people want to use the offline functionality, they would need to prefund their offline wallet. Just like today with people having to withdraw banknotes in order to use cash.
These features show that a digital euro is being designed as a means of payment and not as a form of investment. And it will preserve the role of intermediaries, contrary to alternative solutions offered by technology firms, which will have no such safeguards.[15]
We have just started to develop the analytical framework and models that would be used to determine the holding limit. This limit will be set to preserve financial stability, having considered the impact on different bank business models and on monetary policy transmission and implementation.
This is a Eurosystem-wide endeavour, and we will engage with banks and other market participants to properly set out the necessary assumptions and define the analytical methodology. We will share our findings with you and the general public. Let me assure you that financial stability considerations are central to our thinking as they underpin our ability to pursue our price stability mandate.
Let me now turn to one of the most important design features of a digital euro, namely privacy. We welcome the high standard of privacy and data protection provided for under the proposed regulation. Ultimately, this is for the European co-legislators to decide.
On our side, we are determined to not only protect but enhance privacy in payments.
First, we already provide cash, the payment instrument that offers the highest level of privacy.We are determined to continue to do so, as demonstrated by our ongoing efforts to produce the third series of euro banknotes.[16]We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure people can continue to have the option to pay with it. They value this option, and we are committed to maintaining it for them.[17]
Second, a digital euro will be usable offline. Paying offline in digital euro would be similar to using cash. Just like cash payments, it would require physical proximity and offer cash-like privacy: personal transaction details would only be known to the payer and the payee.
Third, a digital euro would allow people to make online payments with very high standards of privacy,higher in fact than what commercial solutions currently offer. The Eurosystem would not be able to identify people based on the payments they make.[18]We would only see a minimal set of pseudonymised data necessary to fulfil Eurosystem tasks, such as settlement.[19]And digital euro users would retain control over how their data is used by payment service providers,[20]who would have access to customer data to prevent illicit activities, such as money laundering or terrorist financing,[21]and also to fulfil their contractual obligations towards customers, while having to respect all applicable privacy protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation. In its Opinion on the digital euro, the ECB also suggests considering the possibility of offering increased privacy for certain low-risk, low-amount payments in digital euro in online mode.[22]
Fourth, we would implement state-of-the-art security and privacy-preserving measures to ensure privacy protection. And we willdeploy strong governance safeguards. Independent data protection authorities will oversee compliance with EU data protection rules and regulations, which are the strongest privacy and security laws in the world. And provisions in the proposed regulation envisage data protection authorities being consulted at an early stage.[23]
Let me conclude.
The digital euro is a common European project.
First and foremost, it is about preserving everyone’s freedom to use a public means of payment anywhere in the euro area, even as payments go digital. And it is crucial to strengthen our collective resilience and autonomy in a more fragile global environment.
That is why it is so important to set an ambitious pace. But money is trust. The digital euro will need broad support. We are therefore committed to supporting your work as co-legislator. And we are engaging with all stakeholders.
In this spirit, I will continue to be available in order to engage with you throughout the preparation phase and beyond. Together, we can build the euro’s digital future.
Thank you."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 8th Annual Conference of Mediterranean Central Banks, organised by Hrvatska narodna banka, Banco de España, OECD, IEMed, and UfM
Split, 14 February 2024
Over the past few years the euro area economy has experienced unprecedented shocks that created exceptional uncertainty and drove inflation to record highs. In response to these inflationary pressures, we embarked on the most forceful rate hiking cycle in the history of the euro. Credibility – very much the focus of today’s conference – is a key central bank asset that becomes even more important in times of high uncertainty. Our policy measures are making a substantial contribution to reducing inflation, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner.
In my remarks today, I will first review the state of the euro area economy and our latest monetary policy decisions. I will then turn to financial stability considerations, before concluding with some thoughts on why action to support the euro area economy is also needed from other policy actors.
Economic outlook and monetary policy
Our interest rate decisions are guided by three considerations: first, the inflation outlook in light of incoming economic and financial data; second, the dynamics of underlying inflation; and third, the transmission of our monetary policy to financing conditions and the real economy.
Starting with our first criterion, incoming information has broadly confirmed the medium-term outlook from our December macroeconomic projections. Economic activity is likely to have stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2023 and incoming data continue to signal weakness in the near term. At the same time, some forward-looking survey indicators point to a pick-up in growth further ahead. Although headline inflation increased in December to just below 3%, on account of energy base effects reflecting impacts from the fiscal measures a year ago, the rebound was somewhat weaker than expected. Aside from energy, all the main components of inflation fell or remained unchanged. Meanwhile, headline inflation declined again in January. This means that the disinflationary process is continuing. We also expect inflation to ease further over the course of this year amid the fading impact of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic reopening of the economy, and as tight financing conditions continue to weigh on demand. The disinflationary trend is also evident in both market and survey-based measures of inflation expectations, which have come down markedly at shorter horizons and are consistent with our target at longer horizons.
The recent shocks not only drove inflation to record highs but also made macroeconomic forecasting especially challenging. Looking at the euro area inflation forecast errors, we have observed two things. First, the absolute size of the errors has declined. And second, the errors have switched sign: inflation is now coming in somewhat below, rather than above, the projections. On the one hand, these developments highlight the lack of bias in the projections. On the other, they reveal a large uncertainty around the baseline projections. It is therefore essential that we do not look at the projections in isolation, but rather alongside incoming data.
Let me now turn to the second criterion. Almost all indicators of underlying inflation are continuing to decline while the range has been narrowing. This confirms that the disinflationary process is under way. Some of the measures are still high, however, as it takes time for the impact of past shocks to fully fade. Domestic inflation – which is more wage-sensitive – has also been moderating but remains elevated and is now at the top of the range amid falling labour productivity and elevated wage growth in the context of a robust labour market. Indeed, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the introduction of the euro – despite slowing labour demand and fewer vacancies being advertised more recently. But the impact of higher unit labour costs on inflation is being cushioned by lower unit profits.
Moving to the third criterion, our past policy rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. In the course of our current hiking cycle, the increase in bank lending rates has reached levels not seen since the launch of the euro. Meanwhile, the weakening in credit has been stronger and faster than in past hiking cycles. Bank lending conditions remain tight and lending flows are still weak, although the latest bank lending survey showed first signs that the net tightening of credit standards and a decline in loan demand are moderating. Tighter financing conditions are also making their way through the economy by dampening demand, helping to push down inflation. And given the typical lags in monetary transmission, much of the economic impact of our past policy rate hikes will continue to materialise over time.
Financial stability
The pass-through to economic activity poses challenges for vulnerable sectors. Higher interest rates in particular weigh on the debt servicing capacity of highly indebted corporates. For these firms, any potential downside surprises in growth could result in subdued earnings, which could further affect debt servicing capacity. Real estate firms remain particularly vulnerable to losses stemming from the downturn in euro area real estate markets. The ongoing downturn is particularly acute in the euro area commercial real estate market, where both activity and prices declined sharply in 2023. On both sides of the Atlantic, the effects of higher interest rates on this sector have been compounded by structurally lower demand for some real estate assets following the pandemic.
Some non-banks and specialised banks remain heavily exposed to interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as highly indebted corporates and real estate. Further deterioration in these sectors could expose intermediaries to revaluation losses and investor outflows. This is especially relevant for open-ended investment funds with mismatches between asset liquidity and redemption terms, including real estate investment funds with a large market footprint in commercial real estate markets in several euro area countries. Low levels of liquidity raise the risk of forced asset sales if macro-financial outcomes deteriorate.
In fact, despite some recent portfolio rebalancing by non-banks, the sector is still showing high duration, credit and liquidity risk. Entities remain vulnerable to asset price corrections amid macroeconomic uncertainty and volatile markets. Parts of the non-bank financial sector also have significant leverage on and off-balance sheet. Fragilities in the sector pose risks to the financial system, also due to its links to the banking sector. Banks and non-bank financial institutions can be closely interconnected through funding channels, ownership linkages and common risk exposures.
In contrast, the euro area banking system has been a source of resilience, with solid capital and liquidity buffers on the back of strong regulation and robust supervision. Bank profitability has strengthened in recent quarters, supported by higher interest rates that compensated lower lending volumes. However, weak lending growth, rising funding costs and deteriorating asset quality are likely to pose downside risks to profits in the future. While asset quality indicators have been quite robust, there are early signs of deterioration in some loan portfolios, including smaller firms and sectors such as construction and commercial real estate. Nonetheless, the current environment of macroeconomic uncertainty shows the importance of remaining vigilant – banks should be prepared for a possible worsening of economic conditions.
Sovereign funding costs have remained stable and contained throughout the tightening cycle, and as the Eurosystem gradually reduces its presence in the sovereign bond market. However, weak growth developments or fiscal slippage could reignite concerns around sovereign debt sustainability, especially in countries where debt is already high.
Challenges ahead
While inflation is on the right track, we need to keep a close eye on the risk factors at play. On the upside, wage pressures remain high and we do not yet have sufficient data to confirm they are starting to ease. Profit margins could also prove more resilient than anticipated. Heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, could raise energy prices and disrupt global trade.
While we are heading in the right direction, we must not get ahead of ourselves. It will take some more time before we have the necessary information to confirm that inflation is sustainably returning to our two per cent target. That is why we will continue to be guided by data. The next few months will be especially rich in new information on drivers of underlying inflation as we receive data on latest wage settlements and price re-setting by firms. We will also have the benefit of new projections in March. In any case, our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.
Adding on to the challenges discussed so far, the unprecedented shocks of the past few years have also had profound effects on the euro area’s low and declining medium-term growth. Euro area potential growth is estimated to have mostly recovered from the pandemic, thanks to sizeable policy support measures such as job retention schemes and the expected impact of the Next Generation EU programme. However, potential growth is very likely to slow down in the future. In this context, other policy areas – notably fiscal and structural policies – have a crucial role to play in complementing monetary policy and supporting euro area growth potential.
Potential output is determined by three main factors. First, total factor productivity, which hinges on supply conditions like the state of technology, as well as market structures and regulations that facilitate an efficient allocation of available resources across firms. The outlook for productivity growth, which has been disappointing in recent decades, especially compared with other major economies, depends in part on how the green and digital transitions play out. Although this twin transition is expected to contribute positively in the longer run, there may be an initial cost as companies have to adjust to new technologies. Second, capital accumulation, which has slowed down considerably since the great financial crisis. Furthermore, it continues to face an uncertain outlook given the increased volatility and high frequency of supply shocks, which may have disrupted investment plans for both tangible and intangible capital. Third, the contribution of labour, which has been the main engine of potential growth in the euro area in the past few years due to strong inward migration, increasing participation of women and the elderly in the labour market, and declining trend unemployment. It is however expected to dampen, reflecting negative demographic developments as the euro area population is projected to decline owing to low fertility rates, assuming no further support from migration[1].
Fiscal and structural policies need to address low growth prospects in the euro area, while also gradually bringing down high public debt ratios. Structural reforms and investments that improve the euro area’s supply capacity – which would be supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme – can help to reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green and digital transitions. In particular, policies to support public and private investment in research and development, digitalisation and sustainable production processes can increase the euro area’s competitiveness and productivity, which currently lag behind those of the United States and China. Additionally, structural reforms that promote labour force participation, support and upgrade education, and improve the matching of skills between labour supply and labour demand can help to mitigate the impact of demographics.
Measures of financial integration in the EU also remain stagnant. The financial system has remained stable, and financial integration has proven resilient to the major shocks but has seen limited progress. EU debt and equity markets are still very fragmented along national borders. As we celebrate ten years of banking union, we have to recognise that it is still incomplete. The capital markets union is also still in its early stages of development, with no visible progress on the main obstacles of taxation or insolvency law. Reducing national and EU regulatory barriers[2]and deepening the Single Market are also key to enhance the euro area’s competitiveness and attractiveness for investment.
The unprecedented series of shocks experienced in the EU and around the globe forced policymakers to focus on swift short-term responses. Both the pandemic and the energy crisis were met with prompt policy measures. In that context, it was perhaps understandable that attention was temporarily deflected from the medium-term vision on EU growth and its challenges. But it is imperative that policymakers now refocus on the medium-term growth prospects. The findings of upcoming reports on the EU’s competitiveness and the future of the European project will need to be taken into account. Structural reforms and investment to address low and declining potential growth require a concerted effort. The cohesion of the euro area and future prosperity of the EU depend on it."

Introductory remarks by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the European Parliamentary Week 2024
Brussels, 12 February 2024
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the future of our Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).[1]The introduction of the euro in 1999 was a milestone for European integration. And this year marks its 25th anniversary. Used by millions of people every day, it has become the most tangible symbol of European integration in our daily lives.
The euro was a democratic choice, and it has seen continued popular support and political commitment. This has proved essential during the economic crises that we have faced. And it remains essential in the unstable world we are living in today. Support for the euro and EMU is in fact at a historical high, with 79% of euro area citizens in favour.[2]And young Europeans have known only the euro as their currency.
So it is fitting that we are discussing the future of EMU during the European Parliamentary Week. The euro, just like the European Union, is only as strong as our commitment to it. And all of you, whether national or European parliamentarians, are essential to this enduring commitment. The euro is our money. It makes us stronger together, and together we make it stronger.
The euro could not have been established were it not for the vision of Jacques Delors, whose passing in December saddened us deeply. Jacques Delors was widely seen as the founding father of EMU. So when thinking about its future, we should reflect on whether we are living up to the spirit that drove him. He believed that the European economic model should rest on three principles: “La concurrence qui stimule, la coopération qui renforce et la solidarité qui unit” (competition that stimulates, cooperation that strengthens, and solidarity that unites).[3]
Today I will examine the state of our EMU through the lens of these three principles, highlighting how they help us identify common priorities for the future.
Competition that stimulates
Let me start with competition – both within Europe and globally.
One of the fundamental reasons for introducing the euro was to strengthen the Single Market. By removing currency exchange costs and risks, the euro has enabled people and businesses to take greater advantage of the Single Market and its four freedoms.[4]In surveys, four out of five euro area respondents say that the euro simplifies doing business and shopping in different countries, and that it makes it easier to compare prices across borders.[5]In other words, the single currency benefits consumers by broadening their choice and lowering prices.[6]And it allows firms to benefit from economies of scale – which incentivise innovation – and from lower costs of intermediate inputs.
However, despite the euro’s success, the Single Market remains incomplete. This reduces both our resilience to shocks and our ability to reap the full benefits of the single currency. I will focus on two areas: labour mobility and financial integration. Both areas have untapped potential to spread risks more evenly[7], enhance our ability to absorb asymmetric shocks, and bring us closer to an optimum currency area.[8]
Higher labour mobility would increase the resilience of our labour markets[9]and strengthen our growth potential by facilitating labour matching across the euro area. It would broaden the pool of workers available to firms and the pool of vacancies available to workers. We can support labour mobility by simplifying the recognition of skills and qualifications, including for regulated professions. And teleworking has the potential to facilitate cross-border digital work if we address the labour and taxation law issues that it raises.[10]
Further deepening financial integration would also enhance risk sharing. In the United States, capital markets smooth out around 30-35% of state-specific shocks, compared with 10-15% across euro area countries.[11]This notably reflects that European equity markets are less developed and integrated, and that there is a lower propensity to invest across Member States. While cross-border integration and competition has been supported by the progress made so far on the banking union and capital markets union, as well as the creation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), we still lack a unified banking, capital and payments market. We need to redouble our efforts if we are serious about bolstering Europe’s capacity to invest and innovate.[12]
For instance, very few bank loans are extended across borders and there are still significant obstacles to cross-border mergers. So we need to give renewed impetus to completing the banking union, including by making progress towards a European deposit insurance scheme that would ensure a level playing field among European banks and limit the bank-sovereign nexus.[13]
Similarly, European digital payment solutions remain largely fragmented along national lines. This would be unthinkable in the United States. Imagine not being able to use a payment card issued in New York to buy something in San Francisco, or having to use a card issued by a foreign company to pay in both cities. A digital euro would remedy this fragmentation. It would provide a European digital means of payment that is available to everyone, can be used everywhere in the euro area, and is free for basic use, just as cash is for physical payments. It would also provide a platform for European payment service providers to offer their services throughout the euro area, fostering competition and innovation.[14]
The importance of “competition that stimulates” becomes even clearer when we look beyond our borders. The euro area is confronted with multiple challenges to its global competitiveness.
As a large open economy, we are particularly exposed to risks of global trade fragmentation. The pandemic and the energy crisis have starkly highlighted the vulnerabilities of supply chain disruptions and a dependence on energy commodity imports, which led to cost spikes that directly affected the competitiveness of European firms. And supply chain risks are forcing firms to adapt their decisions about where they produce their goods and from where they source their inputs.[15]
All of this means that we need to act on several fronts at the same time.
First, we need to rebalance the euro area’s economic model by shifting from an over-reliance on foreign demand to a stronger emphasis on domestic demand, supported by robust investment. Weak domestic demand has become a factor that firms are citing in their decision to relocate out of the EU.[16]And because savings have consistently exceeded investment in the euro area, we have been exporting our net savings to the rest of the world. We should instead be using these savings to invest more at home. If we do not sufficiently reinvest our savings in our domestic supply chains and infrastructure, we will lose external competitiveness over time.
Second, pressure on Europe’s cost competitiveness emphasises the importance of investing in key areas such as technology and education, which support the euro area’s non-price competitiveness. This in turn means that we need to direct public expenditure more towards investment, notably in human capital and research and development. In the years that preceded the pandemic, euro area public investment barely compensated for the depreciation of the capital stock[17], which had direct implications for the quality of public infrastructure. And the share of public money spent on education is at a historic low.[18]We may already be seeing the results of this underinvestment. According to the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)[19], since 2009 the average performance of 15-year-olds in the euro area has dropped by 19 points in mathematics, and 14 points in reading and science.[20]
Third, we need to ensure that European companies can reap the benefits of the Single Market. In practice, this means enabling them to operate seamlessly across the entire continent. Otherwise, we will be left with the status quo where global players that benefit from a large domestic market also end up dominating the European market, while firms in Europe remain confined to their national markets. This reduces competition in Europe and undermines our competitiveness. And the risk is further accentuated by the ongoing global subsidies race. This is best addressed by a common European response that protects fair competition for all European companies, rather than uncoordinated national strategies that risk further undermining the Single Market.
In other words, the external competition we face should stimulate us to act together to support and create the conditions for higher domestic investment. And ensuring open and fair competition within the Single Market is a necessary condition for the euro area’s external competitiveness.
Cooperation that strengthens
Let me now turn to the second principle of the economic model envisaged by Delors, “cooperation that strengthens”.
As long as the euro area remains primarily a monetary union, with fiscal and economic policies conducted mainly at the national level, cooperation is crucial for us to achieve our shared objectives.[21]As an example, in 2022 EU budgetary spending was equivalent to a mere 2.5% of EU Member States’ total government spending. This means that the stabilisation, allocation and redistribution functions of fiscal policy remain overwhelmingly in the hands of national governments.
But if Member States cooperate with each other, they can exchange valuable insights and practices. For instance, the success of the short-time work schemes that were available in some countries during the global financial crisis led to other euro area countries replicating them. During the pandemic, these schemes helped protect employment, incomes and productive capacity across the entire euro area, enabling a swifter recovery. And at European level, the SURE[22]instrument enabled these schemes to reach their full potential.[23]
The need for cooperation among Member States was formalised in an economic governance framework that incorporates rules on national government spending, as stipulated in the Stability and Growth Pact. Although these rules were strengthened and expanded in response to the sovereign debt crisis, the first 25 years of the euro have highlighted some limitations. Fiscal governance in particular has suffered from excessive complexity and a lack of ownership. It did not prevent procyclical policies and high levels of public debt in some Member States. And it failed to incentivise public investment.
The review of the economic governance framework was launched to address these issues and I welcome the political agreement reached by co-legislators. While the revised framework remains fairly complex, it will help strike a balance between sustainable public finances and debt reduction on the one hand, and incentives to commit to reforms and investment on the other, while also supporting countercyclical fiscal policies. But it is essential that the revised framework is implemented in a manner that remains faithful to its objectives, otherwise it will not be credible.
At the same time, fiscal rules remain complex and focused on national circumstances, with limited consideration for their implications for the aggregate euro area fiscal stance. And a purely rules-based approach entails a difficult trade-off between discretion and credibility. This requires moving the focus of the governance framework from rules to institutions.[24]While our rules are of course a crucial anchor of confidence, there are several good reasons for granting European institutions greater discretionary power where needed.
First, European institutions can play a pivotal role in facilitating cooperation among Member States. The European Commission is a case in point.
Second, European institutions can establish stronger ownership, underpinned by clearer and more direct accountability. This applies both in a democratic sense, towards the European Parliament and the Council, and in a judicial sense, towards the European Court of Justice. In this respect, the ECB has long supported integrating the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) into the EU’s legal framework[25], particularly in view of its expanded powers. A commitment to bringing the ESM under the EU’s legal framework during the next legislative term could help unlock the current stalemate on the ratification of the revised ESM Treaty – which is essential to make the Single Resolution Fund’s common backstop operational and an integral step towards completing the banking union.
Third, strengthening the role of European institutions can help to account for spillovers across countries and policy areas. For instance, it enables us to better account for the implications of individual countries' fiscal measures for the fiscal stance of the euro area as a whole. And this in turn makes it easier to define macroeconomic policies. Demand shocks, for example, require fiscal policy and monetary policy to work in the same direction. The response to adverse supply shocks, meanwhile, can benefit from a situation in which fiscal policy and monetary policy complement each other. Targeted and temporary fiscal support can smoothen the inflationary impact of such shocks, helping monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored.[26]And fiscal policies that support supply reduce the need for monetary policy to dampen demand. Combined with a monetary policy aimed at preserving price stability, such fiscal policies lower the risks of stagflation. Over time, they also reduce the risk of scarring the economy, which would reduce potential output.[27]
But today, supply shocks are unwinding. Supply disruptions have eased and energy prices have fallen, therefore a different combination of macroeconomic policies is required. On the one hand, governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures, while seeking to reduce the euro area’s exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices by diversifying their sources of energy. On the other hand, with demand still weak and inflation expectations anchored, there is no need for monetary policy to generate further slack to keep inflation in check. The unwinding of supply shocks creates scope for demand to recover without fuelling inflation.
In this phase, another type of cooperation is useful – cooperation between and with social partners. This was close to Jacques Delors’ heart, and he often stressed its importance. For me it is not a solely theoretical issue: my university mentor Ezio Tarantelli was assassinated by terrorists because of his ideas about combating inflation through social dialogue.[28]But social dialogue is as relevant today as it was in their times. In the euro area, for example, the terms of trade tax that resulted from the energy shock has been absorbed mostly through workers’ lower real incomes, while profits have held up. Lower energy prices now create scope for some wage catch-up, especially if profits normalise. But it will ultimately be a combination of these dynamics that determines whether inflation converges durably to our target. This is why we need to remain data-driven as we consider our next monetary policy decisions.
Solidarity that unites
Let me now turn to the third principle of the economic model advocated by Delors: “solidarity that unites”. We cannot expect solidarity to emerge if it is not understood to be in the best interests of both the euro area as a whole and each of its members. And we cannot maintain solidarity in our Economic and Monetary Union if it is seen as a “transfer union”. EMU will only be supported if there is a shared understanding that we all benefit when we act together and support each other.
Owing to intertwined supply chains, financial networks and trade links, euro area countries’ economies are closely interconnected. Trade between them, for instance, represents around half of euro area GDP.[29]So while much of Europe’s strength stems from this interconnectedness, it also means that economic developments in euro area countries cannot be seen in isolation: a downturn in one part of the euro area can lead to lower growth and employment across the entire region.[30]
When faced with exogenous economic shocks, everyone stands to benefit from this solidarity.[31]A common response carries more economic weight as benefits in one country spill over to other countries. We saw this clearly in the European response to the pandemic. Unlike during previous crises, Europe responded in a way that was both countercyclical and united. As a result, the economic cost for the euro area was much lower than that of the financial and sovereign debt crises. It took two years for GDP and employment to return to their pre-pandemic levels. This was much faster than after the global financial crisis, when it took GDP seven years and employment nine years to return to pre-crisis levels. And the cost in terms of higher public debt as a share of GDP has been much lower.[32]
Our ability to act together is also crucial in responding to the common structural challenges we face. This is particularly evident in areas such as the energy and digital transitions, as well as defence, where there are large economies of scale and mutual benefits to joint initiatives. Given the size of the financing needs and the implications for the euro area’s competitiveness and resilience, investments in these public goods are best made together.[33]The Commission has estimated that the EU’s green and digital transitions will require additional annual investments of €620 billion and €125 billion respectively.[34]And while much of this will have to come from private funding, estimates show that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the additional investment for the green transition will need to be funded by the public sector.[35]
During the pandemic, European solidarity gave rise to a significant new instrument: Next Generation EU (NGEU). It offered a European safe asset, supporting confidence at a time of crisis and preventing financial amplification. It focused on common priorities – digitalisation and the green transition – and protected competition by reducing the temptation of beggar-thy-neighbour policies within the Single Market. And with Member States reviewing each other’s recovery and resilience plans, it gave fresh impetus to cooperation. NGEU illustrates the potential of European initiatives and its implementation is now well under way.
But we must ensure that NGEU lives up to its full potential. This will depend crucially on the quality of the reforms and investments implemented under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). Despite significant progress on both the reform and investment fronts, we see that Member States are finding it challenging to maintain the pace envisaged in their recovery and resilience plans.[36]As we approach the end of NGEU’s disbursement horizon, we need to deal with the challenge of disbursing available RRF funds by end-2026. Considering the RRF’s positive track record and the major challenges ahead for Europe, we should think carefully about how to strike a balance between ambition and speed. The positive impact of these funds on potential output depends not only on the capital contribution they represent but also on their ability to lift total factor productivity growth. And this hinges on the funds being used well. With the RRF mid-term review upcoming, now is a good time to reflect on how best to ensure good use of funds and whether the disbursement period could be extended for this purpose.[37]
At the same time, if we want to be able to take the action needed to finance the investments required to respond to our common challenges, we also need to start discussing what comes after NGEU – a key question for the next Commission.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
As external – and especially geopolitical – challenges become more frequent and severe, bolstering Europe’s resilience to these challenges and the associated economic shocks becomes more crucial. Put simply, the “costs of non-Europe”, a key reason behind Delors’ initiative to establish the Single Market and EMU[38], are on the rise. It is therefore vital that we further strengthen these two central elements of our European project. Initiatives like NGEU have shown the potential benefits of taking action at the European level and embracing the principles of Delors’ economic model. If we want to strengthen our union through competition, cooperation and solidarity, this should not be a one-off.
Thank you for your attention."

Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the joint Banco de España, Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics and European Central Bank conference “External statistics after the pandemic: addressing novel analytical challenges” in Madrid
Madrid, 12 February 2024
Introduction
It is my great pleasure to speak at this second edition of the conference on external statistics, jointly organised by the Banco de España, the Irving Fisher Committee and the European Central Bank, after having contributed already to the first edition of this conference in Lisbon in February 2020, just before the onset of the pandemic.[1]As a long-standing user of external statistics, both in academia and as a central banker, I am very pleased to see that since the last conference the richness and availability of external statistics – in particular for the euro area – has been further enhanced. This is of particularly high value for the analysis we do regularly at the ECB, as I will show today. At the same time, there are still significant measurement shortfalls in external statistics and many analytical hurdles to overcome, including specific challenges for the euro area.
Today I willfocus on the analysis of euro area financial flows, in the current context of the monetary policy tightening cycle and elevated geopolitical tensions. In addition, I will outline some areas where I see potential for further enhancing the statistical information available for such analysis and for improving the underlying statistical infrastructure.
The euro area is highly financially integrated, both internally and externally: an accurate measurement of financial linkages is key for our understanding of euro area exposures to external shocks and the international transmission of the ECB’s policies. The analysis of euro area cross-border financial linkages has become increasingly complex in recent years, in particular owing to the expansion of international financial intermediation chains, which often involve non-bank entities located in international financial centres, including in some euro area countries.[2]At the same time, the ECB – together with the euro area national central banks – has developed new breakdowns of the euro area balance of payments and international investment position (b.o.p./i.i.p.) statistics that facilitate an enhanced, albeit still imperfect, analysis of risk exposures and interconnectedness.[3]
Euro area financial flows at the current juncture
Euro area international financial flows sharply reversed in 2022 – from a multi-year peak observed in 2021 – into the largest retrenchment since the global financial crisis (Chart 1).[4]The retrenchment affected both foreign assets and foreign liabilities, in line with their strong co-movement observed over the past decades. More recently, in 2023, euro area financial flows started to pick up again.
The swings in euro area international financial flows over the past few years were to a great extent driven by foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment (Chart 2).[5]Accordingly, I will focus my remarks on these two components of the financial account that – due to the intricacies of euro area financial intermediation – require a particularly careful analysis. To this end, I will use the available detailed official statistics, but also draw on insights from research studies.
Euro area portfolio investment flows – the sectoral dimension
I start by examining detailed information at the euro area (resident) sectoral level to better understand the factors driving aggregate foreign portfolio investment flows. Focusing on the non-bank financial intermediaries sector provides valuable insights.
At a structural level, the sectoral breakdown reveals the predominance of the investment funds sector (including money market funds) as holders of portfolio investment securities issued by non-euro area residents. It accounts for 64% of total equity and debt holdings in the third quarter of 2023. It follows that an analysis of the cross-border investment patterns by investment funds is crucial, not only for assessing the exposures of the investment fund sector, but also for understanding those of the underlying investors. Insurance companies, pension funds and households are significant holders of euro area investment fund shares, while foreign investors residing outside the euro area are also major investors in euro area funds.[6]Recent research shows that euro area investment funds are a source of portfolio diversification for the underlying euro area investors, in particular towards extra-euro area assets.[7]For foreign investors, euro area investment funds not only provide exposure to euro area assets but also constitute intermediation vehicles for global portfolio investment.
Investment funds account for a significant proportion of the fluctuations in international portfolio investment flows (Chart 3). This is consistent with a procyclical demand for investment fund shares, with the underlying investors strongly affected by shifts in global sentiment. This helps to explain the 2022 retrenchment, given the low risk appetite prevailing in global financial markets following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The data also confirm that insurance corporations and pension funds tend to be more stable investors, at least in relation to their direct holdings.[8]
While a structural analysis of the drivers of euro area portfolio flows is beyond the scope of today’s remarks, I would like to highlight that – apart from the geopolitical factors weighing on investor sentiment – the monetary policy tightening of the ECB may also have contributed to the retrenchment in portfolio flows. In fact, the shifts in investment patterns observed in 2022 marked an end to a protracted phase of large-scale portfolio rebalancing towards extra-euro area securities, which had started in 2014 when the ECB introduced negative interest rates and launched its asset purchase programmes.[9]More recently, the net purchases of foreign securities by euro area investors rebounded amid the global shift in the interest rate environment, with higher interest rates especially prompting a step-up in international bond purchases.
On the liability side of euro area portfolio investment, investment funds played a similarly large role in the drying-up of foreign net purchases of euro area equities in 2022. The combination of the sizeable euro area investment fund industry and the strong extra-euro area investor base – especially for those funds based in Ireland and Luxembourg – amplifies euro area financial flows, particularly during times of sharp shifts in risk sentiment (Chart 4). At the same time, since the amplification in part reflects the pass-through holdings of external investors in external assets, the impact on euro area financial dynamics is overstated by focusing on un-adjusted measures.[10]
Higher euro area interest rates and the ending of net asset purchases by the Eurosystem have visibly boosted the appetite of foreign investors for euro area debt securities since 2022 (Chart 4). This is a reversal of the pattern during the years 2014-2019 when foreign investors were large net sellers of euro area debt securities, especially sovereign bonds. That is, monetary policy clearly plays a significant role in determining net foreign debt inflows, via both the level of interest rates and balance sheet policies. In an environment of rising interest rates, foreign investors have turned into net buyers of euro area debt securities, especially sovereign bonds and bank bonds.
Euro area portfolio investment flows – the geographic dimension
The new counterpart breakdowns available in the euro area b.o.p./i.i.p. allow for a better coverage of the geography of international financial flows, vis-à-vis both advanced economies and emerging market economies.[11]These data reveal that in 2022 euro area investors reduced their exposures to equity securities in a broad-based fashion across geographic counterparts (Chart 5).[12]The retrenchment was particularly pronounced vis-à-vis the United States and the United Kingdom.
For debt securities, the picture is more nuanced: during the retrenchment in 2022, euro area investors on balance sold a significant amount of securities issued by US and UK residents, while net purchases continued vis-à-vis other advanced economies and the non-euro area EU (Chart 5). The strong net sales of debt issued by emerging market economies and offshore financial centres were particularly striking, especially given their relatively small weight in the euro area portfolio. Among emerging market economies, these net sales were driven by disinvestments of securities issued in China, Mexico and Russia.[13]While euro area net purchases of debt securities recovered strongly vis-à-vis most regions in 2023, the sentiment towards emerging economies and offshore financial centres remained muted.
While at first sight emerging economies and offshore financial centres may appear as rather unrelated investment destinations, these are in fact closely linked, since the debt securities issued in offshore financial centres are to a significant extent issued by subsidiaries of corporations based in emerging markets, particularly in China. Recent research, as presented in the first session today, finds that euro area and US investment in emerging market corporate bonds is substantially larger when investment in issuance by offshore subsidiaries of emerging market corporations is taken into account.[14]For the euro area, estimates show that the “nationality-based” holdings of corporate debt securities of the BRICS countries are around six times higher.[15]This example highlights the difficulty in tracing ultimate exposures across the financial intermediation chains. At the same time, it shows how ambitious research involving the careful merging of various datasets may provide complementary information to the public, which could lay the ground for future enhancements to official statistics.
While information on the geography of euro area portfolio investment assets has become increasingly rich, it is notoriously difficult to obtain a full grasp of the foreign holders of euro area securities.[16]This relates to the phenomenon of globally missing assets, as the portfolio investment liabilities that are reported globally consistently exceed reported assets.[17]This gap, in turn, can be linked to a significant degree to equity securities issued in the United States, Ireland and Luxembourg.[18]There is a range of conjectures on the origins of the globally missing assets. A primary explanation relates to the non-reporting of assets held in custody abroad (so-called third party holdings), in particular by investors with no statistical reporting obligation such as households or non-financial corporations.[19]Within the euro area, such third-party holdings are already reported by custodians as part of the securities holdings statistics, which increases the coverage of intra-euro area portfolio investment holdings. However, security holdings that are held in custody outside the euro area can at best be estimated.[20]In closing this significant data gap, I see room for international initiatives to promote a comprehensive and granular reporting of third-party holdings (for instance in the context of the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey) by those countries with a strong custody industry.[21]
Euro area foreign direct investment flows
Taking a longer-term perspective, euro area foreign direct investment (FDI) flows were remarkably stable for decades, even during crisis times, before entering a phase of exceptionally large, positive flows from about 2015 (as shown in Chart 2). This was followed by a period of high volatility and – more recently – a strong retrenchment phase.[22]
As I have noted on previous occasions, the developments in FDI over the past decade have been very much driven by euro area financial centres due to the presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in these economies.[23]MNEs tend to have complex organisational structures which frequently involve numerous legal entities, including special-purpose entities (SPEs), across various countries.[24]
While the interpretation of euro area headline FDI figures has not become easier over the years, more detailed sectoral and geographic breakdowns facilitate the analysis of FDI. Moreover, our understanding of euro area FDI is set to improve further in the near future, with the publication of a separate breakdown for SPEs in euro area b.o.p./i.i.p. statistics.
Taking a sectoral view of the retrenchment observed in euro area FDI since 2022 reveals the important role of the other financial institutions (OFI) category, which also includes SPEs and holding companies (Chart 6).[25]The strong positive correlation between gross FDI asset and liability transactions related to OFIs suggests that these “financialised” flows often “pass through” the euro area without being absorbed in the domestic economy. Preliminary data suggest that SPEs represent around 30 per cent of euro area FDI asset and liability positions and 55 per cent of FDI assets and liability positions in the OFI sector. More insights on the role of SPEs in euro area cross-border statistics will become available with the publication of the b.o.p./i.i.p. dataset for SPEs this spring.
In contrast to OFI-related FDI flows, the FDI flows of the non-financial corporate sector are mainly driven by the euro area countries outside the group of financial centres and hence tend to be more closely related to developments in the real economy. Accordingly, while there was no large-scale retrenchment, the recent slowdown in this sector’s FDI transactions  appears to be consistent with lower global and euro area growth momentum and might also provide tentative signs of companies pulling back from overseas direct investment amid heightened geopolitical risks.[26]
The geographic breakdown of FDI flows brings additional insights (Chart 7). The recent retrenchment occurred vis-à-vis counterparts in the United States, United Kingdom and in offshore financial centres, which suggests a close relation to MNE operations, particularly in combination with the sectoral evidence presented before. Having said this, euro area FDI asset flows to other destinations have proven to be more resilient in recent years, albeit on a much smaller scale.
Similarly to portfolio investment, even these more detailed FDI data remain insufficient to fully look through the often complex cross-border chains to identify the ultimate investor countries and ultimate host economies involved in FDI relationships. This is a notoriously difficult task, not only due to the complex ownership structures of MNEs, but also because it requires very comprehensive information. Sharing data among national statisticians across borders could be helpful – something I will return to later in my remarks. Nonetheless, some research-based advancements in identifying the ultimate countries involved in an FDI relationship (also to be presented at this conference) provide useful insights.[27]Data on inward FDI on an ultimate basis reveal, for example, a much larger role of the United States as an investor in the EU compared to the official (immediate counterparty basis) data.[28]
Potential enhancements to data and statistical infrastructure
Combining b.o.p./i.i.p. statistics with security-level data such as the European System of Central Banks’ (ESCB)Securities Holdings Statistics allows for a granular analysis along various dimensions, such as currency, issuing entity and security characteristics, including the rating.[29]For the latter, experimental ECB data on euro area portfolio investment assets show an increase in the share of high-rated debt securities since 2021, in line with a preference for safer assets during times of elevated risk aversion (Chart 8).[30]
In addition, and this also stressed in the ongoing update of the balance of payment manual, it is very useful to have a fully integrated view of the international investment position, showing how the transmission of financial shocks propagates through the valuation channel arising from exchange rates and other asset price movements to an economy’s external balance sheet.[31]Unlike when I started doing research on this topic, nowadays such data are readily available in the official statistics of many economies, including for the euro area, with a considerable degree of detail, and show, for example, the importance of exchange rate-induced valuation effects (Chart 9).
To enhance the analysis of globalisation-related phenomena, and in particular to isolate the impact of MNEs, I support the plans of the ESCB to establish new data on foreign-controlled non-financial corporations in the balance of payments and the financial sector accounts. It would also be essential for such data to be available for the non-financial accounts, in order to observe the impact of MNEs on production and capital formation patterns. In this context, I would like to stress once more that it is analytically very useful to have fully consistent data on external accounts and domestic sectoral accounts, as is the case for the euro area datasets on b.o.p. and quarterly sector accounts. This supports the analysis of interconnectedness and helps to identify domestic sector imbalances that ultimately drive external imbalances.[32]
More generally, in terms of statistical infrastructure, I would like to highlight again that further efforts are needed to improve the analytical value of macroeconomics statistics. In my view, to keep official statistics fit for policy analysis, these need to enable a fast response to crises and keep pace with the rapidly evolving global activities of MNEs and financial intermediaries. For example, I am very much in favour of the development and use of experimental statistics to boost statistical agility. In this context, the pandemic has shown the usefulness of “non-standard” higher-frequency data sources, for instance to enhance our understanding of labour market dynamics.
Another improvement that is worth considering is facilitating the safe exchange of confidential statistical information for well-justified statistical purposes across borders, especially within the ESCB/European Statistical System (ESS). This can be achieved by a sound and supportive legal basis, coupled with robust and safe information technology systems supporting the exchange of data. This would minimise the risks of unlawful disclosures, while maximising the benefits of synergies through collaboration between statistical authorities.[33]
As I have advocated before, there is a strong case for exploring avenues to collect data on internationally active, large MNEs in a centralised way, at the EU rather than national level. This could eliminate information gaps and overlaps across countries and ensure a more timely, complete and consistent cross-country recording of the activities of MNEs. A coordinated approach across the EU could be a win-win situation, as it would reduce the statistical reporting burden of MNEs by removing the need to complete questionnaires from 27 Member States in more than 20 languages. This streamlined process would not only benefit the MNEs themselves but also the statistical authorities responsible for collecting and analysing the data. It would improve timeliness, enhance the accuracy of reporting and ultimately contribute to a more efficient and effective system of data management. This is already being pursued by the ESCB in relation to the banking industry through standardising area-wide data reporting by banks.[34]
Conclusion
In my remarks today I have focused on euro area financial flows in the current context of the monetary policy tightening cycle and geopolitical tensions. I have stressed the usefulness of available data for the regular analysis we do at the ECB, but I have also highlighted the areas where measurement issues still hamper our full understanding of portfolio investment and foreign direct investment exposures.
I would like to highlight once more that further efforts are needed to improve the analytical value of external statistics and this can be achieved by enhancing the underlying statistical infrastructure.
As a long-standing user of external statistics, I very much look forward to the discussions at this conference and will closely follow future enhancements to the data on cross-border statistics."

Keynote speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 30thAnnual Congress of Financial Market Professionals organised by Assiom Forex
Genoa, 9 February 2024
Since their inception, central banks have continuously adapted to the changing requirements of the payment sector.[1]They have also taken a keen interest in ensuring it functions smoothly, to protect financial stability and the implementation of monetary policy.
Central banks provide the financial system with a safe asset at its core: central bank money. Convertibility into central bank money is what keeps the value of private money stable. And the pivotal role played by central bank money is what connects all the different parts of the payments system. In short, central bank money ensures the singleness of money and the integration of the payments system.
This is particularly valuable in a monetary union like the euro area: central bank money – cash or reserves – can be used to settle transactions from and to all parts of the euro area. This ensures that one euro in Lisbon is the same as one euro in Riga.
But for central bank money to retain its stabilising and unifying role, it must stay at the forefront of technology to ensure it remains an attractive means of settling payment transactions. There is no reason why central banks should be the only stakeholders not keeping pace with the digital transformation. In fact, they should be at the vanguard of this transformation, acting as an anchor of stability for financial innovation and providing a safe path for modernising finance. The Eurosystem is working to maintain this role.
This is true for retail payments. That is why we are working on a digital euro, so that everyone can use central bank money not just in its current physical form – cash – but also in digital form.[2]
Today, however, I will focus on new technologies for settling transactions between financial institutions in central bank money, often referred to as wholesale CBDC to distinguish it from retail CBDC, which is used by the general public.
Historically, central banks have played a key role in simplifying the settlement of these transactions, supporting and often leading the transition from physical forms of money to book-entry formats, and to the electronic clearing and settlement of payments, making it possible to update accounts almost instantaneously.[3]
We now find ourselves on the brink of another significant shift: the advent of tokenisation. According to market participants[4], digitally representing claims using distributed ledger technology (DLT)[5]has great potential. However, this transformation could redefine current financial intermediation and wholesale settlement structures.
To enable central bank money to continue performing its stabilising role, even as the financial system undergoes this transformation, we need to find technological solutions that will allow it to also be used to settle transactions recorded on new DLT platforms.
Let me now explain the role central bank money currently plays as an anchor of stability for wholesale payments. I will then discuss the promises and risks of new technologies for wholesale payments before telling you a little more about how we are exploring new technologies for central bank money settlement of wholesale transactions.
Central bank money as an anchor of stability for wholesale payments
While “wholesale CBDC” is generally presented as something new, made possible by the emergence of DLT, central bank money has in fact been available in digital form for wholesale transactions between banks for decades.[6]In 2022 the Eurosystem’s large-value payment system, TARGET2 (T2), processed 92% of the total value settled by large-value payment systems in euro and remained one of the largest payment systems worldwide, processing 102.6 million transactions amounting to €570.5 trillion.[7]In other words, every six business days T2 settles transactions equivalent to the euro area’s annual GDP.
Financial institutions use central bank money mainly for two reasons.
First, central banks issue the safest and most liquid settlement asset, avoiding the credit and liquidity risks associated with private money systems. Being able to convert into central bank money the money that commercial banks issue strengthens public confidence in private means of payment. This in turn reassures market participants that the value of a euro is the same, regardless of its issuer.
Second, settling in central bank money limits the risk associated with wholesale financial markets of payment activities becoming concentrated in individual players.
The widespread use of central bank money to settle wholesale payments therefore minimises the risks for the financial system as a whole and provides an anchor of stability for payments. International standards recognise how crucial this is.[8]
That’s why the Eurosystem has continued to modernise its market infrastructure services to make them future-proof and ensure they can meet the needs and expectations of market participants.
In March 2023 a new T2 platform was launched, providing modernised services, enhanced cyber protection and optimised liquidity management across all TARGET services. The platform aligns with ISO 20022, facilitating the exchange at global level of more granular data in a more structured manner. Moreover, in November we will launch the European Collateral Management System, a unified system for managing assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations that will ensure collateral flows freely across the euro area, contributing to financial integration.
In the context of securities settlement systems, the EU is also considering a shift from T+2 settlement to T+1 or even T+0, potentially decreasing counterparty credit risk and collateral needs.[9]Successfully implementing this change requires careful analysis of costs and strong coordination between all market players. At the same time, we must take into account that other jurisdictions, such as the United States, are making the transition to shorter settlement cycles.[10]While experience suggests that the coexistence of different settlement cycles in the EU and other non-EU jurisdictions is feasible at the technical level[11], we must prevent this mismatch in settlement times from weighing on the attractiveness of European capital markets. We must therefore carefully consider whether, and how, to harness the benefits of aligning standard settlement cycles across major jurisdictions, provided this does not impair the smooth functioning of EU financial markets and financial market infrastructures.
Alongside these challenges of a more traditional nature, we also face challenges relating to the rapid digitalisation of the economy. While the market is calling for standard transactions to be settled more efficiently, it is also calling for solutions to accommodate new use cases. As central bankers, we have to monitor these developments closely and be prepared to respond to them.
New technologies for wholesale payments: promises and risks
The advent of blockchain technology has spurred experimentation among a broad range of market players, including banks and financial market infrastructures.
The application of distributed ledger technology to wholesale financial transactions is still at the exploratory stage, despite the financial industry’s strong interest in DLT. Currently only around 22% of European banks use DLT, while another 22% are testing or experimenting with it.[12]But a majority of market stakeholders surveyed by the Eurosystem expect a significant uptake of DLT for wholesale payments and securities settlement in the next five to ten years.[13]
The benefits of DLT for trading financial assets are twofold. First, it can enhance efficiency by allowing market participants to perform the three key phases of a transaction – trading, settlement and custody – on the same distributed ledger. Of the many advantages this offers, participants mention lower credit risk, fewer failed transactions and less need for extensive reconciliation. DLT can operate on a 24/7 basis, which would tackle the issue of international market fragmentation caused by different time zones. Lastly, the use of smart contracts[14]can help streamline the process of verifying and executing transactions.
Second, DLT opens avenues for new applications, such as providing new ways to raise capital and trade financial instruments. A shared platform could make the trading of financial instruments more efficient and resilient, particularly those not currently serviced by financial market infrastructures like over-the-counter traded securities or credit claims. Thanks to lower costs and reduced complexity, DLT platforms could be more easily accessed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This would underpin the EU’s capital markets union objective to improve SMEs’ access to capital.[15]Moreover, experiments with tokenised bank deposits are underway to assess innovative ways of transferring funds – using blockchain technology, for example – between clients of the same bank or group of banks.
DLT is also being explored as a possible means to improve cross-border payments.
However, it is worth noting that these solutions are not always radically innovative, as the benefits associated with them can also be achieved in other ways. For instance, the Eurosystem’s TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) service offers immediate payment settlement in central bank money 24/7, facilitates automated and conditional payments through application programming interfaces and is establishing itself as a useful platform for cross-border payments.
Potential DLT-based innovations are still at an early experimental stage. Nevertheless, central banks cannot afford to sit on the sidelines, as any widespread adoption of such innovations could jeopardise the anchoring role of central bank money in guaranteeing the efficiency and stability of our payment system. Many explored DLT use cases involve transactions, notably in securities, currently settled between banks using central bank money. These include delivery-versus-payment settlement in both primary and secondary markets, along with recurring payments during the life cycle of securities, such as coupon payments.
Insofar as these applications lead to a proliferation of decentralised private money-based settlement systems, including stablecoins and tokenised deposits, they could lead to the refragmentation of wholesale payments. This in turn could impair central banks’ ability to provide liquidity in periods of financial stress, elevating financial stability risks.
Eurosystem surveys show that this is not the desired outcome for market participants. They would generally prefer to continue settling in central bank money, or even to expand the range of central bank money settlement services available.
In fact, the absence of solutions enabling settlement in central bank money could impede innovation due to the credit risk associated with private settlement assets. Market players might shun promising new technologies if central bank money is unavailable as a settlement asset.
The availability of solutions for settling DLT-based wholesale financial transactions in central bank money could have the added benefit of facilitating the interoperability and integration of decentralised systems. It could also create opportunities to use central bank money to settle transactions currently settled in commercial bank money, such as over-the-counter derivatives, thereby reducing credit risk in the system.
The ECB’s exploration of new technologies for wholesale central bank money settlement
The Eurosystem envisages two options for DLT-based infrastructures for settlement in central bank money.
The first involves unified ledger solutions.[16]In these solutions, euro central bank money and other assets, such as securities or foreign currency, would be recorded and settled on the same DLT platform. This could potentially be operated by the Eurosystem or jointly with other parties, subject to compliance with Eurosystem rules.
Although it may be easier to realise the envisaged benefits of new technologies if all assets and cash involved in transactions are on the same platform, reaching consensus on how to regulate and manage this is not without considerable challenges[17]. This could take years given the difficult technical, legal, governance and business considerations , especially when multiple types of assets and jurisdictions are involved.[18]Moreover the implications of using DLT for the conduct of monetary policy need to be fully understood and possible risks duly assessed and mitigated.
Moreover, the move from existing systems to DLT platforms is likely to be gradual, as the market is still in the early stages of development and market players still need to make major technological decisions. This means there would be coexistence with legacy systems, whether operated by central banks or private stakeholders. This situation calls for solutions that can adapt to rapid market innovation while still serving traditional use cases and enabling seamless interaction between old and new systems. By achieving sufficient harmonisation and interoperability, there is a good chance that the desired automation can be attained, even across different platforms.
The second option for DLT-based infrastructures for settlement in central bank money is thus based on interoperability-type solutions. Such solutions are likely to be faster to develop and less costly, and they do not prevent us from continuing to assess unified ledger solutions. The Eurosystem has for some time been looking at interoperable solutions and conducting exploratory work in cooperation with interested market participants. These solutions could respond to immediate market demand and involve creating a link between market DLT platforms and central bank payment infrastructures. This link would, for example, enable securities or foreign currency transfer on a DLT platform to trigger settlement in euro central bank money, which may alternatively be provided in the form of DLT tokens, registered on a platform operated by the Eurosystem, or in central bank accounts in infrastructures based on existing technology.
Several interoperability-type solutions have been developed by national central banks within the Eurosystem, including the Deutsche Bundesbank’sTrigger Solution, theTIPS Hash-Linksolution developed by the Banca d’Italia and the Banque de France’sFull DLT Interoperabilitysolution.
The Eurosystem’s exploratory work consists of experiments involving mock transactions and trials in a test environment in which a limited number of actual transactions will be settled. In December we published acall for expression of interestto participate in these experiments which will be conducted this year. The results will form the basis for the Eurosystem’s future considerations about wholesale payment infrastructure.
The Eurosystem is not alone in exploring new technologies for wholesale financial transactions. Currently, up to 86 central banks around the world are exploring various ways to interact with DLT platforms.[19]Cross-border projects coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and its innovation hubs are exploring how new technologies could potentially improve cross-border transactions.
Achieving a truly integrated market for wholesale transactions, whether DLT-based or not, requires collaborative efforts between public authorities, central banks and the market. In this respect, the European Union is at the forefront. By adopting a pilot regime[20]for DLT-based market infrastructures, European legislators have made it possible to experiment using real transactions. And by developing a solution for central bank money settlement of wholesale financial transactions recorded on DLT platforms, the Eurosystem is backing regulation with innovation. This has the potential to give Europe a competitive advantage in developing its industry base for DLT trading and in supporting the international role of the euro.[21]
Stakeholders considering a move to DLT should ensure they do not trigger the recurrence of market fragmentation. This involves enabling interoperability between platforms, harmonising protocols or adopting a common data taxonomy. Agreeing on industry standards and implementing them across the ecosystem is crucial, not only for DLT-based transactions but also for settlements using existing technologies.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The rapid growth of digital technologies has sparked widespread market interest and experimentation. DLT-based technology is seen as promising, with the potential to increase efficiency for some existing transactions and to facilitate new use cases.
But we must be cautious that such innovations do not undermine the stabilising role of central bank money in settling transactions among financial institutions. Instead, central banks must be ready for the possible broad adoption of new technologies and keep pace with them as they have done in the past. This will help to combine innovation with financial stability, facilitating the modernisation of finance.
Achieving this requires public-private partnership to shape the future ecosystem for wholesale central bank money settlement. This collaboration should harness the benefits of new technologies while ensuring that settlement remains secure and efficient.
As we push the technology frontier, we must recognise that there are still many aspects that need to be understood in greater depth. The Eurosystem is playing its part by making central bank money solutions available for exploratory work. It is also conducting further analysis to develop its vision for the future wholesale financial transactions ecosystem. However, it is ultimately the market’s responsibility to demonstrate the added value of DLT for wholesale business cases, and to establish and implement the necessary standards.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Philip R. Lane, member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Hutchins Center on Fiscal & Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution
Washington, D.C., 8 February 2024
Today, I wish to report on the progress in disinflation in the euro area.
Chart 1 shows the dynamics of headline and core inflation, extended forward through 2026 on the basis of the December 2023 Eurosystem staff projections.[1]Relative to its pandemic low point in late 2020, inflation started to increase in early 2021, rising above the two percent medium-term target in July 2021. Inflation continued to climb through the rest of 2021 and most of 2022, peaking at 10.6 percent in October 2022. Since late 2022, inflation has declined and stood at 2.8 per cent in January 2024. According to the December 2023 Eurosystem staff projections, inflation is expected to stabilise around the two per cent target from about the middle of 2025 onwards.
The main factors in the 2021-2022 inflation surge were the direct and indirect effects of the energy shock, together with a set of pandemic-related factors including supply chain bottlenecks and, during 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and demand-supply mismatches associated with the reopening of the contact-intensive service sectors (Chart 2).
By the time headline inflation peaked at 10.6 per cent in October 2022, energy inflation had reached 41.5 per cent. Since then, energy inflation has not only stabilised but turned negative: in January 2024, it stood at -6.3 per cent. The energy shock also contributed to very high food inflation: at 5.7 per cent in January, food inflation has come down substantially from its peak of 15.5 per cent in March 2023 but remains elevated. Core inflation was 3.3 per cent in January, down from the 5.7 per cent peak also in March 2023. The decline in goods inflation has been the main driver in core disinflation, with goods inflation standing at 2.0 per cent in January, down from 6.8 per cent in February 2023. Inflation in the services sector stands at 4.0 per cent, having eased less so far than the other components; its peak was 5.6 per cent in July 2023.
Overall, the strong disinflation over the past year largely reflects the unwinding in energy inflation (which, in turn, partly reflects large base effects), which explains about half of the disinflation (Chart 3). In addition, the ongoing easing of pipeline pressures and the relaxation of supply bottlenecks have supported the disinflation in the other HICP components. Monetary policy tightening has contributed to the disinflation process by dampening demand and anchoring medium-term inflation expectations at our two per cent target.
While the December 2022 projections had foreseen considerable disinflation during the course of 2023, the realised pace of disinflation has exceeded these estimates (Chart1). Energy prices not only stabilised but fell considerably in the course of 2023 (Chart 4), including due to the impact of global monetary tightening on world activity levels and commodity prices.
The downward revisions to 2023-2024 growth reflected unexpectedly-weak global demand for European exports and the under-estimation of the adverse impact of the 2021-2022 decline in real incomes and the terms of trade on consumption and investment dynamics. In addition, the scale of deceleration in credit dynamics was underestimated.
During the disinflation process, forecast errors have been small, and even turned negative in recent times (Chart 5 and Chart 6). This stands in contrast to the inflation surge period, which triggered substantial one-quarter ahead forecast errors in September 2021 ECB staff macroeconomic projections and the following rounds.[2]
Charts 7 and 8 compare the current inflation episode in the euro area to a sample of past episodes.[3]The scale of the inflation shock to headline exceeds previous episodes, which reflects not only the energy shock but also the preceding rebound from the very low inflation during the initial months of the pandemic. The disinflation of headline inflation so far is proceeding in a fairly symmetrical fashion. However, core inflation measures have peaked later and remain at relatively high levels from a historical perspective. This is driven primarily by the dynamics of services inflation, whereas goods inflation has already come down more decisively. Amongst other factors, the adjustment of the services sector to rising energy costs and the impact of the price level shock on subsequent nominal wage dynamics is necessarily a gradual process, especially in view of the staggered nature of the wage setting process in European labour markets. In addition, the pandemic reopening effect was still supporting unusually high pricing power in contact-intensive services sectors through the summer of 2023.
In the December 2023 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, HICP inflation is projected to decrease from an average of 5.4 per cent in 2023 to 2.7 per cent in 2024 and 2.1 per cent in 2025, and then to stand at 1.9 per cent in 2026 (Chart 1). In 2024, energy inflation should increase as base effects turn positive and some fiscal support measures are scheduled to be discontinued. This is expected to partly offset further declines in food inflation and HICP inflation excluding energy and food (HICPX), implying that headline inflation will fall only gradually in the course of 2024. From the end of 2024, all the main inflation components are expected to continue to ease, supporting headline HICP inflation in reaching the ECB’s target in the second half of 2025.
Inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices evolve in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations for the future path for oil and gas prices (Chart 4). This is recognised in the risk assessment of the January ECB monetary policy statement. It is also reflected in the Consensus expectations of external experts, which are below the December 2023 Eurosystem staff projections in the near term (Chart 9). Work by ECB staff (Lenza et al. (2023) – using a machine‑learning approach with about 60 variables, weighted according to their track record – also points to the possibility of outturns below the December projections.[4]That said, it is worth emphasising that the confidence bands associated with the analysis are very wide, which cautions against putting too much weight on the centre of the distribution.
The broad range of underlying inflation measures have come down substantially from their peaks and also fell in December, reflecting the fading impact of past shocks and weaker demand, including due to the ongoing strong transmission of tighter monetary policy (Chart 10).[5]However, while at a general level, measures of underlying inflation are meant to capture the persistent component of inflation and therefore send signals about medium-term inflation, the relative price shocks that have been triggered by the scale and breadth of the energy shock and the pandemic- and war-related shocks mean that standard measures of contemporaneous underlying inflation may, in fact, not send reliable signals about medium-term inflation dynamics.
Making an adjustment for the impact of energy costs and supply bottlenecks on core inflation deliver measures that peaked at lower levels.[6]The difference between the adjusted and standards measures of underlying inflation suggests that the temporary factors amounted to at least two and a half percentage points at the peak. There is still around one per cent of temporary factors in the unadjusted measures as of now, but the difference is fading out gradually. In addition, this adjustment technique does not correct for the additional pricing power of firms in contact-intensive services during the pandemic reopening phase. To the extent that this effect is also fading out, further deceleration in underlying inflation can be expected.
Momentum indicators have eased further for headline inflation and all of its components (Chart 11). The annualised three-month-on-three-month growth rate of seasonally-adjusted HICPX stand at 1.4 per cent, with momentum in goods inflation at zero and momentum in services inflation close to 2 per cent, while the momentum of food inflation is around 3 per cent.
Taken at face value, these readings might be interpreted as challenging the medium-term forecast. However, according to the staff projections, several factors are expected to raise momentum in the coming months, for both headline and core inflation. First, the windfall of plunging input costs through lower energy costs and lower intermediate prices, which may have temporarily muted the need for firms to raise prices is expected to level out. This, in turn, means that rising wage costs (even at the decelerating rate foreseen in the projections) will exert stronger upward pressure on overall costs. Second, the projections foresee a recovery in domestic and external demand this year. All else equal, this will increase pricing power compared to last year. Third, many of the fiscal measures that leaned against strong price pressures in 2022 are scheduled to expire, which will act to push up prices in the near term. This combination of factors explains why the overall trajectory of inflation in the December 2023 projections only converges to the target in the second half of 2025.
In assessing the wage data, compensation per employee from the national accounts provides the most comprehensive measure (Chart 12). However, these data become available only with a lag of over two months. According to the December 2023 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, euro area wage growth is expected to have peaked in 2023 but to remain above the medium-term steady state level during 2024 and 2025, reflecting the ongoing gradual correction of the real wage gap that was generated by the 2021-2022 inflation surge, together with robust labour markets.[7]
Growth in compensation per employee edged downward to 5.3 per cent in 2023Q3 from 5.5 per cent in the previous two quarters. Forward-looking wage trackers provide timely and higher-frequency complements to the official wage data releases and may act as leading indicators for the subsequent releases of the official compensation per employee data.[8]One important indicator from the wage tracker is average wage growth for twelve months ahead, as embedded in agreements reached in the latest quarter (Chart 13).[9]This indicator also gradually edged down in the second half of 2023. Many wage agreements will be renewed in the early months of 2024, and updates to the wage trackers will provide essential information in projecting wage dynamics.
The available survey indicators are broadly consistent with the decreasing wage profile foreseen in the latest Eurosystem staff projections (Chart 14). According to our most recent discussions with large European non-financial corporations, the wage growth expectations of this set of companies for 2024 are 4.4 percent on average, which is a marked easing compared to the average 2023 wage growth of 5.3 per cent.[10]Similarly, in the ECB’s latest Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), expectations for annual growth in compensation per employee point to a gradual decline in wage growth looking ahead and were revised down over the longer horizon. While expectations are only slightly below that forecasted for 2024 in the December 2023 BMPE round (by 0.15 percentage points), SPF respondents expect a much faster decline in wage pressures in 2025 and 2026.
Finally, progress along the disinflationary path will also depend on firms buffering rising labour costs with a slowdown in profit growth. Since the aggregate level of profits surged in 2021-2022, there is some room for profit compression without driving profitability to below-average levels (Chart 15). The contribution of unit profits to domestic price pressures continued to fall in the third quarter of 2023, suggesting that unit profits are absorbing some of the price pressures coming from rising unit labour costs. The profit margin proxies derived from the responses to recent corporate telephone surveys also suggest that this buffering process is at work (Chart 16).
Finally, a successful disinflation process requires inflation expectations to be anchored at the two-per cent target over the long term. Taking a longer view, following the protracted period of below-target inflation, between the middle of 2021 and early 2022, there was a remarkable shift in long-term inflation expectations, with survey respondents moving away from long-held views that inflation would indefinitely remain below the two per cent target (Chart 17). While there certainly was a marked increase in the fraction of survey respondents that expected inflation to remain above target in the long term, the majority of respondents assessed that the inflation shock served to re-anchor long-term inflation expectations at the target by demonstrating that inflation risks were two-sided. In turn, reinforced by the target-consistent monetary policy decisions during this period, the stabilisation of inflation expectations has provided an important anchor in the disinflation process.
In this respect, it is encouraging that measures of shorter-term inflation expectations have come down markedly more recently, while measures of longer-term inflation expectations mostly stand around 2 per cent. In particular, the inflation expectations of professional forecasters have moved down over the entire horizon, with longer-term expectations now standing at 2.0 per cent (Chart 18). Similarly, while the expectations component contained in market-based measures of inflation compensation, such as the five-year-in-five-years inflation-linked swaps, has remained anchored at two per cent throughout the inflation episode, it is notable that risk premia have receded over recent months (Chart 19).[11]
Conclusion
Let me conclude. The declining trend in underlying inflation has continued, and our past interest rate increases keep being transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. By tightening financing conditions, the restrictive monetary policy stance is dampening demand, and this is helping to push down inflation and stabilise inflation expectations.
The December 2023 Eurosystem staff projections see inflation stabilising around the two per cent target from about the middle of 2025 onwards. The incoming data suggest that the process of disinflation in the near term in fact may run faster than previously expected, although the implications for medium-term inflation are less clear. At the same time, the strength of the recovery of the economy, the path of fiscal policies, wage developments, and the degree to which firms absorb higher input costs, all in a context of continued heightened geopolitical uncertainty, will have an important bearing on the inflation trajectory. The March 2024 ECB staff macroeconomic projections will provide the opportunity for a comprehensive update of our medium-term inflation outlook.
We will continue to follow a firmly data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.[12]In this process, monetary policy needs to carefully balance the risk of overtightening by keeping rates too high for too long against the risk of prematurely moving away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. In terms of an overall evaluation of our policy trajectory, we need to be further along in the disinflation process before we can be sufficiently confident that inflation will hit the target in a timely manner and settle at target sustainably."

Introductory remarks by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ninth meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures
Frankfurt am Main, 17 January 2024
Cyber risks have become one of the main issues for global security. The associated annual cost is estimated to exceed $200 billion globally.[1]And cyber threats have been identified as a systemic risk to the stability of the European financial system.[2]But cyberattacks tend to be underreported.[3]
Against the backdrop of an evolving cyber threat landscape where the risks continue to grow, the Euro Cyber Resilience Board (ECRB) offers a unique forum that brings together pan-European financial infrastructures, their critical service providers, central bank overseers and other key European authorities for strategic discussions on cyber risks. It enables the sharing of sensitive information in a trusted environment, contributing to the resilience of the European financial system.
Just last week a social media account of the US Securities and Exchange Commission was compromised and an unauthorised post was published.[4]As you are no doubt aware, this led to a temporary increase in the price of crypto-assets, especially bitcoin. While it was not a particularly large-scale or complex cyberattack, this example shows that cyberattacks can be used to manipulate market narratives and prices for financial gain. In a world where news and social media can have large real-time impacts on financial markets, the damage can be significant.
In this context, having a forum like the ECRB is very beneficial. It enables its members to combine their cybersecurity efforts for their own benefit and that of the wider financial ecosystem.
By observing the latest trends in cyber threats and what is driving them, we can better anticipate future threats. This is why we have the ECRB’s Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU).
And by sharing best practices and measuring ourselves against common standards, we can better protect the security and integrity of the financial system. Collectively, we are better equipped to deepen our understanding of cyber threats, defend ourselves against them and minimise their possible impact.
In my remarks today, I will briefly discuss the current cyber threat landscape, the potential impacts of new technologies and our approach to assessing and closing gaps in cyber resilience.
The current cyber threat landscape
The ECRB has long cautioned that cyber risks are coming ever closer to the core of the financial system. We have seen sporadic major cyberattacks on financial institutions or their service providers, resulting in disruption to both the financial system and the real economy. And cyber threats overall have become more aggressive. For instance, we are seeing an increasing number of cyberattacks that attempt to disrupt services or attain unauthorised access to data and services, including ransomware attacks.Geopolitical conflicts are also leading to a further rise in cyberattacks. These developments underline the need for continuous investment in cyber resilience.
Let me highlight two major threat areas.
First, ransomware attacks, such as the recent attack on the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China that disrupted trades in the US treasury market.[5]This demonstrated the need for international cooperation against ransomware attacks, which are a global threat. Such cooperation is necessary to make the business model of criminals unattractive, by making attacks more risky and less profitable. This is the objective of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative[6], which brings countries together to fight against ransom payments. Given the role of crypto assets as the payment method requested by ransomware attackers, countering ransomware will also require developing effective crypto-asset seizure regimes. Empirical evidence indeed shows strong correlation between cyber risk exposure, investor attention to crypto and the price of bitcoin.[7]This creates a doom loop between cyber risk and crypto valuations. Higher cyber risks raise crypto demand expectations, pushing crypto prices up. In turn, higher crypto prices boost the incentives and resources for ransomware attacks.
Second, financial entities need to put robust risk management practices in place to account for their increasing use of outsourcing and their high dependence on third-party service providers. Such practices are set out, for instance, in the guidance on managing supply chain risk recently provided by the Financial Stability Board.[8]
Over the past year the ECRB has placed particular emphasis on this topic, calling on financial entities to perform due diligence prior to contracting a service provider, to identify and manage all their critical service providers, and to monitor interconnections along the supply chain. Turning to authorities, central bank overseers require financial market infrastructures to identify, assess and manage interdependencies stemming from third-party service providers and oversee critical service providers. The new EU regulation on digital operational resilience – DORA – contains requirements for critical ICT third-party service providers and for the creation of a pan-European forum to oversee these providers.[9]
We are also dependent on utility providers, like energy companies, telecommunications firms or water suppliers. While they are not considered third-party providers as such, we all have a clear interest in the smooth operation of critical infrastructures. We can support their cyber resilience by sharing tools they may find useful. For instance, theTIBER-EU frameworksimulates cyberattacks, under real-life conditions and in a controlled manner. Some utility providers have made use of the framework already.
The impact of new technologies on the cyber threat landscape
New technologies provide opportunities to support and improve our cyber resilience, but they can also pose challenges for cyber security.
For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for sophisticated cyberattacks, with malicious actors leveraging its potential for social engineering, reconnaissance and exploitation. Attackers may even be able to reverse-engineer AI models, circumventing their guardrails and utilising them with malicious intent to conduct successful operations. Malicious AI tools have already been designed to assist users in carrying out criminal cyber activity. We can expect these types of malicious tooling to become more advanced as attackers become more sophisticated in their use of AI and the technology evolves further. At the same time, AI can help increase cyber resilience and counter cyberattacks, including AI-generated attacks. For example, AI can support threat intelligence in collecting and analysing data. AI can also help prevent and detect cyberattacks by identifying anomalies in user, system and network behaviours in real time.
The development of quantum computing is another example. Quantum technology holds the promise of vastly expanding computational power and opening up new ways of communicating. While predictions about the availability and impact of quantum technology vary, the effect it may have on cybersecurity deserves special attention and awareness. For instance, it may be able to break the cryptography algorithms currently used for communication and data protection. Discussing post-quantum cryptography environments within the ECRB will help us understand the opportunities and risks.
Identifying potential weaknesses to more effectively mitigate cyber risks
The Eurosystem regularly conducts cyber resilience surveys of financial market infrastructures, in which many ECRB institutions participate. This enables the cyber resilience of each entity to be assessed and helps gain an overview of progress and the remaining vulnerabilities across the sector. The findings at the individual level are discussed and followed up by the entity and its respective central bank overseer. One common outcome that can be derived from the survey is the correlation between good governance and strong cyber resilience of an entity. A good understanding of cyber risks at board level translates into better-informed decision-making and leads to the allocation of the resources needed.
The survey also revealed a correlation between high cyber resilience and red-teaming exercises like those provided by TIBER-EU. Such exercises shed light on the entity’s cyber resilience, allowing it to mitigate any identified gaps in its defences in a very tailored manner. The ECB, together with the TIBER community of authorities, is engaged in a high number of tests and facilitates an active exchange to further develop testing tools and promote their use by all stakeholders.
Besides cyber resilience surveys and red-teaming exercises, stress tests and cyber resilience exercises play a crucial role in identifying and closing potential gaps and weaknesses. In 2024 the ECB will stress test 109 directly supervised banks on their cyberattack response and recovery capabilities, based on a scenario of a successful cyberattack that disrupts their daily operations.[10]Similar cyber resilience exercises for financial market infrastructures have been run in the past by the Eurosystem and further exercises are being prepared. These efforts reinforce each other.
A key element of cyber resilience is the reporting and disclosure of cyber incidents by infrastructures and entities in the financial sector as well as other critical sectors. Considerations about the impact on reputation and customers’ or investors’ trust may naturally be at play but should not influence incident reporting requirements according to the relevant oversight and regulatory frameworks.[11]Indeed, any underreporting of incidents may worsen the impact and undermine the containment of a cyberattack. In this context, it is also important to have precise plans for disclosing incidents to relevant stakeholders in the ecosystem and for communicating to the public. In addition, trusted groups, like CIISI-EU for ECRB members, help entities analyse and learn from cyber threats and incidents and prepare better plans to avoid contagion. This is a formula that may also be used in other critical sectors.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Financial market infrastructures are networks that mitigate risks but can also become a source of systemic risk if they malfunction. The increasing threat of cyberattacks and the damage and disruptions they can cause emphasise this clearly.
Our financial system is only as strong as its weakest link. In other words, cybersecurity is our common good and it leaves no room for compromise: we need to remain one step ahead of attackers. To achieve this, we need to take a system-wide approach and continuously work together.
The ECRB is a major part of this effort, offering a space for trustful sharing of information, practices and techniques that increase our common and individual cyber resilience. At the same time, central banks and authorities work together at international level in close collaboration with the industry, as cyber risk is not a local or regional phenomenon, but a global threat.[12]
As the new chair of the ECRB, I look forward to working on these challenges and improving our common cyber resilience. The information we will share with each other today and the further progress we will make will help strengthen the cyber resilience of Europe’s financial sector."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 14th edition of Spain Investors Day
Madrid, 10 January 2024
Over the past two years, economic developments in the euro area have been shaped by the easing of pandemic-related supply constraints and by the energy price shock in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Before that, inflation had been low and monetary policy accommodative, but the surge in inflation to unprecedented levels in 2022 prompted the ECB to normalise and tighten monetary policy. In December 2021 we announced a gradual reduction in our asset portfolio and in July 2022 we increased our key interest rates for the first time in 11 years. This was followed by nine consecutive hikes that raised interest rates by a total of 450 basis points by September last year. In 2023 a lot of progress was made in curbing inflation. However, more needs to be done to ensure a timely and sustainable return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.
In my remarks today I will provide an overview of the latest economic developments and the rationale behind the monetary policy decisions that we took in December. I will then discuss the outlook for the euro area economy for the coming months.
Inflation
2023 ended with an inflation rate of just below 3% in December, which was good news. The uptick from November was widely expected, reflecting base effects and the withdrawal of energy support measures. Euro area inflation had been above 10% in October 2022 and at 8.6% at the start of 2023. The decline in 2023 affected all the main components of headline inflation, confirming a broad-based disinflationary process that gained momentum in the second half of the year.
Food inflation has declined substantially from its peak of over 15% in March 2023, but remained high at just above 6% in December. Energy inflation remained deep in negative territory in December, recording the eighth consecutive decline since May 2023.
Another important aspect is that core inflation entered a clear downward trajectory, continuing to decline to 3.4% in December. Services prices have been slower to recede, but they fell sharply in November and remained stable in December. Taken together, these trends reflect the indirect effect of falling energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the increasing pass-through of our monetary policy tightening to demand. However, high wage pressures, the outcome of upcoming wage negotiations and intensifying geopolitical tensions add on uncertainty around the future path of inflation.
The rapid pace of disinflation that we observed in 2023 is likely to slow down in 2024, and to pause temporarily at the beginning of the year, as was the case in December 2023. Positive energy base effects will kick in and energy-related compensatory measures are set to expire, leading to a transitory pick-up in inflation, similar to what has happened with Spanish headline inflation in recent months. Inflation in Spain peaked in July 2022, reaching 10.7%, and disinflation set in earlier than in other euro area countries, with the rate coming down to 1.6% in June 2023. Since then, the large drop in energy prices has fallen out of the calculation and inflation increased by an average of 3% between July and December.
Economic activity
By contrast, growth developments are more disappointing. Economic activity in the euro area slowed slightly in the third quarter of 2023. Soft indicators point to an economic contraction in December too, confirming the possibility of a technical recession in the second half of 2023 and weak prospects for the near term. The slowdown in activity appears to be broad-based, with construction and manufacturing being particularly affected. Services are also set to soften in the coming months as a result of weaker activity in the rest of the economy.
The labour market continues to be particularly resilient to the current slowdown. The euro area unemployment rate stood at 6.4% in November, broadly unchanged from October and close to its historical low.
However, we are seeing the first signs of a correction taking place in the labour market. The latest data on total hours worked show a slight decline in the third quarter, the first since the end of 2020. This is mainly driven by the reduction in the average hours worked offsetting the increase from the rise in employment. The continuous decline in job vacancy rates, which marginally decreased again in the third quarter, suggests that the ongoing labour market adjustment may also weigh on the number of jobs.
Financial and monetary conditions
With regard to financial and monetary conditions, our past interest rate increases continue to be transmitted strongly to financing conditions, with lending rates for business loans essentially unchanged in November, at over 5%, and mortgage rates increasing to 4%. The tight financing conditions are propagating through the economy, dampening demand and helping to push down inflation.
Before taking its December decisions, the Governing Council closely considered their implications in terms of fragmentation risk and financial stability. Government bond markets are stable, sovereign yield spreads have been resilient to the normalisation of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, and investors have been able to absorb the extra securities released by the reduction in the asset purchase programmes. Euro area banks have proven resilient, boasting comfortable levels of capital and strong profitability which make them well equipped to withstand adverse shocks. Despite these strong fundamentals, bank valuations remain compressed, pointing to concerns about the long-term sustainability of bank earnings amid weak growth prospects, increased downside risks from deteriorating asset quality, lower lending volumes and higher funding costs. Direct and indirect links between banks and the lightly regulated non-bank financial sector also pose risks to the financial system as a whole and highlight the need to boost non-bank resilience going forward. The overall outlook thus calls for vigilance and macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities.
Monetary policy
At its December meeting the Governing Council decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. This decision was based on the overall assessment of the economic and inflation outlook, as well as the effects of our monetary policy. We believe that the current level of interest rates, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target.
At the last meeting we also decided to advance the normalisation of our balance sheet. We intend to continue to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) during the first half of 2024. Over the second half of 2024, the PEPP portfolio will decline by €7.5 billion per month on average. We discontinued asset purchase programme reinvestment of redemptions in July 2023 and we expect to discontinue the reinvestments under the PEPP from 2025.
The key ECB interest rates are our primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. Our future decisions will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.
Conclusion
The events of the last two years have significantly shaped economic developments in the euro area, pushing up inflation to levels not seen since the introduction of the euro. In response, we started a gradual reduction in our asset portfolio and we increased our policy rates by a total of 450 basis points. Our strong reaction was key to prevent a de-anchoring of expectations and to curb inflation. In terms of economic activity, the slowdown has so far been contained and gradual. However, the incoming data indicate that the future remains uncertain, and the prospects tilted to the downside.
The inflationary shock that we were confronted with following the energy crisis has been particularly challenging: it occurred in an already difficult environment, with the world economy recovering from the pandemic and global supply chains still disrupted. Furthermore, supply side shocks are particularly difficult to manage using monetary policy instruments. In this context, sustainable and investment-oriented fiscal policies aimed at promoting the energy transition, strengthening the resilience of supply chains and increasing euro area productivity are supportive of our price stability goal. Structural reforms and investments to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity can help reduce price pressures in the medium term.
In this regard, we very much welcome the agreement on the EU’s economic governance framework reached a few weeks ago. It is a powerful signal to markets as it reduces uncertainty about fiscal rules in the EU. The reformed framework will help strike a balance between sustainable public finances and sufficient debt reduction on the one hand and room for reforms and investment on the other, while supporting countercyclicality of fiscal policies. Achieving this balance turned out to be less straightforward than we might have hoped. It is now crucial that the new fiscal framework is implemented properly and without delay.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB
House of the Euro, Brussels, 7 December 2023
Introduction
The March 2023 turmoil sent shockwaves through the financial world. It brought back ominous memories of the fall of Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers, and the ensuing great financial crisis.
Start-ups and venture capitalists that deposited money at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) were in a bind.
People worried that more banks would start to wobble.
Investor trust suddenly eroded and banks’ stock prices plummeted.
The collapse of SVB and takeover of Credit Suisse became the most serious system-wide banking stress since 2008.
Several reports have now been published on the lessons learned from this crisis episode and they all highlight the importance of effective banking supervision.
In its candid investigation report into the failure of SVB, the US Federal Reserve concludes that supervisors were too focused on accumulating supporting evidence, instead of pushing banks to fix their risk management.[1]
The report issued by theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)invites supervisors to ‘’review their supervisory toolkits to ensure they are sufficient to drive concrete action at banks’’.[2]
And theIMF report “Good supervision: Lessons from the Field”concludes that supervisors around the world would be well advised to reflect on whether they have the appropriate powers, ability and willingness to act.[3]
In my remarks today, I am taking up the question posed by the IMF. Do we, at the ECB, possess the necessary powers, ability and, crucially, the willingness to act in banking supervision? The short answer is an unequivocal yes. And we are increasingly focused on taking action to get banks to remedy deficiencies that have so far remained unaddressed.
Keeping banks safe and sound hinges on good supervision
Strong and intrusive supervision is pivotal in ensuring financial stability.
As a dozen US senators wrote to the Federal Reserve following the collapse of SVB, “Irresponsible and excessive risk taking by SVB should serve as a clear reminder that banks cannot be left to supervise themselves.”
But why is that the case? In other words, what is the rationale for prudential supervision? What is it that we are trying to be effective at?
Clearly, supervisors do not run banks. The primary responsibility for ensuring that banks manage risks properly lies with their management bodies.
The ECB’s banking supervision mandate is given by the SSM Regulation, according to which we should carry out our tasks “with a view to ensuring the safety and soundness of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system”.[4]
Such a mandate is fairly typical for prudential supervisors. But where does it come from?
Citizens usually have neither the time nor the expertise to inspect banks’ balance sheets, so they “delegate” the duty of ensuring financial stability to supervisory authorities.
Another reason is moral hazard. The fundamental difference between a bank and any other company is that banks inherently operate with high leverage. This gives them an incentive to take on excessive risks to maximise returns. Prudential supervision helps to curb moral hazard by encouraging responsible risk-taking and monitoring banks' risk management practices. This is especially relevant because financial markets are prone to market failures. Information asymmetry is a common problem, as banks have more information about their financial health than depositors or investors. Prudential supervision is needed to mitigate this imbalance by ensuring that banks disclose accurate information and maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses.
And because financial systems are interconnected, and the failure of one financial institution can have cascading effects on others, prudential supervision is crucial to maintaining overall financial stability.
That’s why our role is twofold. The first is of a detective nature. We keep a close eye on banks, both to gauge whether they are adhering to regulatory requirements and to detect any practices that might undermine financial stability.
Second, our role is to ensure that banks take timely and commensurate corrective action on issues of prudential concern that surface during the detective phase.
This means that, in certain circumstances, we should stand ready to get banks to do things they don't necessarily want to do and to stop them from doing things they would like to keep doing.
The IMF identified some common pitfalls that supervisors around the world should look out for. Supervisors not only need to identify weaknesses, but also have the appropriate powers, ability and willingness to drive concrete and timely remedial action at banks.
So how do we go about it?
I will highlight three areas. First, the detective phase of our supervisory assessment. Second, whether we have the right corrective tools to get banks to change their behaviour. Third, our willingness to act using our supervisory powers.
Supervisory assessment
When we identify issues, or ‘findings’ as we call them, what we are really trying to identify are one of two things: either whether a bank does not, or within the next 12 months likely will not meet a prudential requirement[5]or that a bank has unsound management and coverage of risk.[6]
In the start-up phase of European banking supervision, we consolidated the best practices that supervisors across the banking union had built up in decades of hands-on experience. This gave us robust analytical capabilities. Our analytical machine is fuelled by well qualified staff from across the banking union, from Nicosia to Tallinn, from Dublin to Madrid, leveraging on cutting edge supervisory technology. Our supervisory teams do this through our annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) which includes the outcome of peer benchmarking to identify outlier banks, on-site inspections, internal model investigations to just name a few. Instead of focusing only on the symptoms, our supervisors are working hard to identify the root causes of the shortcomings.
But our expert resources are not infinite. We cannot always look, or at least not in the same level of detail, at every risk in every bank and do this every year. So we need to prioritise in a risk-based manner.  In fact, we have already increased our risk focus, for instance by introducing so-called multi-year planning in the SREP and by implementing a supervisory risk tolerance framework that empowers supervisors to focus on the most impactful matters.
Tools
So we have the analytical capabilities and increased the risk-focus in the detective phase.
But can we give banks the right incentives to remedy the deficiencies we identify? Do we have the powers to get banks to do things they don’t want to do?
Let me emphasise that we do not come to the task empty handed.
European banking supervision has at its disposal a broad set of very powerful tools.
But what are these tools, exactly?
The first is what we supervisors refer to as moral suasion. This approach relies on persuasion and informal pressure rather than formal, legally binding requirements. Our experience shows that myriad supervisory findings can be resolved in this way. Very often, when we find something, banks concur with our assessment, promptly fix the issue and that’s the happy end of the story. But there are also times when moral suasion doesn’t lead to the desired outcome or works only because banks know that there are more intrusive tools available.
These more intrusive tools are the bindingsupervisory measureslaid down in Article 16 of the SSM Regulation.
Many think that requiring banks to hold additional own funds is the main tool that supervisors have. But it is far from being the only one. Article 16 of the SSM Regulation gives the ECB the power to impose what we call “qualitative requirements”, based on the bank’s specific circumstances. Let me dwell on just a few of these qualitative requirements.
We have the power torequirethe reinforcement of arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies.
We have the power torequireinstitutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets in terms of own funds requirements.
We have the power torestrictor limit the business, operations or network of institutions or to request the divestment of activities that pose excessive risks to the soundness of an institution.
We have the power torequirethe reduction of the risk inherent in the activities, products and systems of institutions.
We have the power torestrictor prohibit distributions by the institution to shareholders, members or holders of Additional Tier 1 instruments where the prohibition does not constitute an event of default of the institution.
And we have the power toremoveat any time members from the management body of credit institutions who do not fulfil the requirements set out in the relevant acts.
Additionally, we can impose periodic penalty payments asenforcement measures, which are designed to compel banks to restore compliance with prudential requirements.[7]
Last, we can imposesanctionsthat are aimed at punishing the misconduct of a bank and deterring future infringements by that bank as well as the entire banking system.[8]
I think you will all agree that the ECB has a rather extensive and intrusive toolbox at its disposal.
So to answer the IMF’s question: do you have the tools? Yes, we have the tools.
The European legislators gave us these tools for a reason. The legislator gave us these tools with the expectation that we use them in accordance with the level of risk mitigation we are expected to bring about.
But have we always used our full toolbox as extensively as we might?
Effectiveness of European banking supervision
In almost ten years of European banking supervision, we have certainly been effective in many risk areas.
For instance, the SSM effectively tackled the legacy asset quality problems that plagued many banks across the banking union. High levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) have been a key priority since the start of European banking supervision. In 2017 we published ourGuidance to banks on non-performing loans, which sets out supervisory expectations regarding the identification, management, measurement and write-off of NPLs. We supplemented this in 2018 by announcing our supervisory expectations when assessing a bank’s levels of prudential provisions for NPLs, which the ECB started to follow in 2021. This announcement played a crucial role in accelerating the reduction in NPLs.
This tangible impact has been well recognised in several external reviews. In September 2022, the ECB proactively tasked five international high-level experts on banking supervision to review our supervisory processes and benchmark us against the highest international standards. In spring 2023, the ECB received not only the report of this externalexpert groupbut also reviews by theEuropean Court of Auditorsand theEuropean Commission. The reports unanimously confirm that ECB Banking Supervision has successfully established itself as an effective supervisor.
But there is no reason for complacency. There are also areas in which banks have been dragging their feet.
This is especially true for internal governance, risk management and business model sustainability for which too many supervisory findings have not been fully addressed for too long. For instance, there is a high number of outstanding findings for weaknesses in risk data aggregation and reporting, which was the lowest-scoring sub-category of internal governance in the 2022 SREP. The Basel Committee issued therelevant prudential standardsin 2013 and the ECB conducted a thematic review on the topic seven years ago. But despite supervisory efforts, too many banks still don’t have adequate risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities.
This is just one example where we ask ourselves how we can incentivise and significantly step-up banks’ effective remediation. This is particularly relevant for weaknesses in internal governance and risk management that are often at the root cause of various problems that subsequently materialise in risks to capital.  The tumultuous events at SVB were a stark reminder of what can happen when banks leave material shortcomings unaddressed for too long. The Federal Reserve’s report is quite clear that although supervisors had identified the issue, they were unable to escalate to enforcement fast enough. Our key lesson from the March 2023 turmoil is that we need banks to accelerate the pace of remediation. The group of independent international experts[9]also recommended that the ECB should establish more timely and forceful escalation processes, leveraging on the full range of supervisory tools.
But how do we do that?
The ECB’s willingness to act
Having progressed from a start-up to a mature supervisor, we must now focus more systematically on which tools we use and under what circumstances. We are taking a structured approach in full respect of the principle of proportionality, which is a general principle of Union law enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that having identified a number of potentially effective measures, the supervisor should always choose the least intrusive one. Supervisors must be clear as to how the chosen measure addresses the unmanaged and uncovered risk and why other measures would not be as effective as the measure chosen.
Central to this is embedding our supervisory actions in an escalation ladder. In other words, if we identify a material risk that needs to be mitigated, we ask ourselves ex-ante: which measure should we adopt to remedy this, and which would be a proportionate timeframe for remediation to take place?
We thus set out a proportionate and time-bound remediation path. By using supervisory escalation, we give banks sufficient opportunities to address the root cause of a problem within a defined timeline.
Fortunately, many banks address the root cause of the problem in response to our supervisory pressure and that’s the end of the story.
But if banks fail to fix the issue timely, we will follow up proportionately, but decisively, by deploying more intrusive supervisory tools.
The IMF report reminds us that the risk of a supervisory decision being reversed by the courts sometimes hinders supervisory action. Let me assure you that the ECB weighs legal risk carefully and does not shy away from effective supervisory action within the remit of its legal framework. In cases where the legal framework is not entirely clear, we seek the most adequate interpretation that gives full effect to the intention of the legislators, and we defend our interpretation in court. Winning a case affirms our interpretation and application of the law and reinforces our initial approach. If the ECB were to lose, I would not necessarily see this as a setback but rather as a valuable opportunity for continuing our work as clarified by the court, in our case, the European Court of Justice. Such outcomes play a crucial role in refining the legal landscape and bring about a clearer understanding of the law.
Taking action through enforcement
Let me now turn to climate-related and environmental (C&E) risks as a recent and tangible example of supervisory escalation following a multi-year strategy.
Back in 2019 our early supervisory assessment suggested that although most banks under our supervision considered C&E risks material, less than a quarter had reflected on how the climate and environmental crises affected their strategy and risk management. Faced with this concerning observation, in 2020 the ECB published itsGuide on climate-related and environmental risks, setting out supervisory expectations for how banks should integrate these risks into their risk management, strategy and governance. However, our supervisory exercises in 2022 showed that banks do not yet adequately manage C&E risks just as any other material risks that they are exposed to.
Building on what banks themselves found reasonable when we first started discussing C&E risk management with them, we set a series of expected interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year and the second at the end of 2023 and a last one at the end of 2024 − by which banks should fully satisfy all of our expectations on the sound management of C&E risks. We have been very clear that we expect this of all banks and that we will use all tools at our disposal to enforce appropriate risk management, strategy consideration and internal governance also of C&E related risks by these deadlines if necessary.
Unfortunately, a number of supervised banks did not achieve the progress expected for March 2023. This means, for example, that two and a half years after we published our guide, these banks had not yet performed an adequate materiality assessment of the impact of C&E risks across their portfolios, which is the basic starting point for managing any type of risk.
So it should be no surprise that we acted on this, in line with what we communicated before. We have started to adopt enforcement measures. We have issued supervisory decisions imposing binding requirements on banks to strengthen their internal control framework in this area, including the potential imposition of periodic penalty payments if banks fail to meet those requirements. In other words, we have told a number of banks to remedy the shortcoming by a certain date and, if they don’t comply, they will have to pay a penalty for every day the shortcoming remains unresolved.
I acknowledge that this is a tool that we have not used very often. It is a step that we do not take lightly. It is not about forcing banks to do something that is merely nice to have. It is about compelling banks to manage material financial risks adequately and in a timely manner.
Conclusion
The turmoil of March 2023 was a clear reminder of what can happen if issues are detected but not acted upon. This crisis episode confirms that intrusive and effective supervision is needed more than ever.
As we approach our 10-year anniversary, European Banking Supervision is putting greater emphasis on impact and effectiveness. To be effective in our supervision we need to have both a razor-sharp analytical focus on risks and insist that the weaknesses we identify are remedied in time.
We recognise that moral suasion is often, but not always, sufficient to get banks to adequately manage their risks. In the latter case, we must actively and proportionally use the legal powers entrusted to us to compel timely compliance with prudential requirements. This approach is vital in preventing identified risks from crystallising into threats to bank solvency or financial stability.
Equipped with the necessary tools and resources, we ensure that our decisions are informed, timely and, crucially, enforceable.
Promoting timely and effective remediation is an essential part of our supervisory DNA and it will be central to European banking supervision in the years to come."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, à l’Académie des sciences morales et politiques, Paris
Paris, 4 December 2023
I am honoured to speak to you today as part of your prestigious academic programme on the many aspects of good governance – a crucial issue in these uncertain and challenging times.
I feel particularly honoured to be speaking to such bright and capable minds, in this iconic meeting place for the scientific, literary and artistic elite of our nation.
The Institut de France is often aptly referred to as a parliament of the learned world. By guaranteeing the independence of knowledge, it offers an open space where all kinds of knowledge intersect, allowing scientific, literary and artistic work to take place freely. In this way, the Institute stands for the protection of liberties and the need for integration[1], two aspects of good governance.
In my view, these aspects also apply to governance in a broader sense, particularly regarding individuals and governments. And they are especially important for supranational governance, as there is often a tension between the need for closer integration – which is likely to advance prosperity – and the wish for greater protection of liberties.
In fact, it’s this tension that leads to rules-based systems and institutions emerging as countries work together voluntarily to forge supranational governance structures. And as international cooperation becomes stronger and more complex, supranational governance must also be strengthened to support it.
But in recent decades we have also seen an imbalance emerge between the authority delegated to supranational governance and its legitimacy in the eyes of citizens. That is partly because supranational governance, by promoting the expansion of economic integration, has also contributed to weakening its own legitimacy.
Today, this lack of legitimacy brings us to a turning point where we must either deepen supranational governance or accept its decline. However, I am confident that we can find a way forward by meeting three essential conditions.
First, by aligning governance with, and focusing it on, people’s priorities. This is what I will call the function.
Next, by using the right forms of governance to effectively respond to people’s concerns. I will refer to this as the form.
And finally, by striving to fulfil that function and serve the public, with what I will describe as courageous and accountable leadership.
The development of global governance
When countries have objectives that they cannot achieve on their own, or face challenges that go beyond their individual capabilities, they are motivated to cooperate internationally. This leads them to voluntarily accept some limits to their autonomy. It could, for example, involve reciprocal market access to promote international trade or a concerted ban on certain products or practices in order to protect the global commons.
But the more countries cooperate internationally, the greater the associated risks. Countries are exposed to unfair competition from trading partners, to spillover effects from other countries’ financial markets and to non-compliance with agreements on protecting the global commons, such as treaties on the environment. That is why supranational governance is needed to mitigate these risks and achieve fair outcomes for all involved. In this sense, governance resides in setting the “rules of the game” in advance and then ensuring that they are fairly adhered to.
This type of governance can take different forms, ranging from creating international institutions to setting global rules and establishing standardisation bodies, or even more informal standards. But crucially, governments agree to this governance, submitting to certain constraints in return for a better response to a need they are unable to meet on their own.
However, there is an inherent correlation between the complexity of interactions among governments − particularly in terms of economic integration – and the authority that needs to be delegated to supranational governance to ensure that outcomes remain fair.
When international cooperation efforts remain fairly straightforward, the authority granted to global governance is often limited. After the Second World War, for example, the Bretton Woods agreements were signed globally, while the common market was set up in Europe. However, these governance arrangements focused mainly on promoting a stable environment for trade in intermediate goods. This reflected the limited scope of economic integration at that time, characterised by capital controls, fixed exchange rates, and high tariff and non-tariff barriers for services.
As interactions become more complex, however, there is a need for that governance to deepen. Look at the EU, for example. To promote economic growth, the countries decided in the late 1980s to transform the common market into a single market, covering capital and services. But a single market is inherently riskier. It exposes people to greater risks from harmful products or to unfair sales practices in jurisdictions that are less well-regulated, as well as to anti-competitive behaviours such as subsidies. And the risks of financial spillovers increase, too.
So the powers of competition authorities and financial regulators had to be strengthened. That’s why in Europe we delegated authority for competition and external trade to the European Commission. Much later, and at the cost of suffering the consequences of not having it in place at the time of the financial crisis, we did the same thing for banking supervision. And we of course also launched a common currency to prevent the Single Market from being undermined by competitive devaluations.
Research has shown that the capacity of supranational governance to issue guidelines and interpret standards increased by around 50% over this period.[2]This triggered a self-fulfilling process, whereby greater economic integration led to deeper governance, which then led to greater economic integration – that is what we know as globalisation.
There have been multiple benefits: across a sample of 147 countries, a one-point increase in globalisation measures was associated with a 0.3% increase in the growth rate in those countries over five years, with lower and middle income countries benefiting even more.[3]Hundreds of millions of people in emerging markets have been lifted out of poverty. Europe has benefited from globalisation too. Between 2000 and 2017, jobs related to exports to the rest of the world increased by two-thirds to 36 million.[4]
Tensions inherent to global governance
But at the time we were not fully aware of the tension inherent in this process. Michael Zürn, an expert on international relations understood it clearly, however, and he developed a conceptual framework in which the growing powers of global governance lead to a lack of legitimacy, followed by a descent into conflict.[5]
All forms of governance need legitimacy. In other words, people need to feel that authority is being exercised wisely. But supranational governance cannot draw its legitimacy from the same sources as national authorities, such as elections or referendums. In practice, it must obtain its legitimacy through expertise and impartiality.
Expertise can confer legitimacy provided that supranational bodies are seen not only as competent, but also as uniquely able to build a framework for sustainable prosperity by virtue of having a supranational perspective that national governments lack.
Similarly, impartiality can confer legitimacy if supranational governance is seen as a way of ensuring that all parties respect the rules of the game and of adjudicating decisions fairly among all members, strong or weak – something that national governments cannot do either.
In this way, there may be long periods in which supranational governance is perceived as legitimate. After the Second World War, for example, public support for supranational governance was very strong, fuelled by the painful memories of the costs of non-cooperation.
A survey conducted in 1952 asked: “In general, are you for or against efforts to unify Western Europe?” The results revealed that 82% of West Germans embraced the idea, as did 78% of British respondents and 63% in France.[6]
But compared with sources of democratic legitimacy, expertise and impartiality are rather fragile, as they can be weakened by major crises or shifts in power dynamics. By enabling deeper economic integration, supranational governance increases the likelihood of that weakness – as we have seen over the past 15 years.
First, we witnessed the great financial crisis, followed by the euro crisis, both of which led to volatile cross-border capital flows. These episodes undermined faith in the idea that free markets regulated by supranational bodies were essential for sustained prosperity. This mistrust was famously summed up in the declaration by UK government minister Michael Gove that people “have had enough of experts”.
These crises caused the credit bubble that had fuelled growth in the early 2000s to burst, revealing the growing inequalities created by globalisation. Over the past 50 years the income gap between OECD countries has risen to unprecedented levels,[7]exposing the limitations of resorting to debt to mask such disparities. This realisation was a further blow to the notion of legitimacy founded on expertise.
Global governance has also been a victim of its own success: the impressive increase in wealth and the growth in the international influence of emerging countries. These new powers, especially China, have legitimately demanded fair representation, becoming less inclined to submit to the governance of others.
This has led to the impartial nature of global governance being questioned on two fronts. On the one hand, emerging powers considered that global bodies overly favoured the interests of their main stakeholders and were too resistant to change. On the other hand, the former powers considered that the newer powers had no intention of playing fair. They therefore considered the rules, institutions and standards of global governance to be inadequate.
And as the global economy expanded, climate change was accelerating behind the scenes, with various international agreements barely making a dent in global carbon emissions. This suggests that even in areas of clear common interest, supranational governance was falling short.
So supranational governance is under threat from all sides, as various groups seek to bend it to their own interests. This is a sign of our times: fragmentation of the global order, gridlock in many international fora, the emergence of populist parties and groups of states coming together to forge new agreements better suited to their interests.
Is there a way of countering this trend?
It is vital that we strive to do so, because global governance is a necessary condition for maintaining international cooperation. We will not be able to preserve its many benefits if we let all that we have achieved go into retreat.
But global governance has to address its legitimacy deficit. And since it cannot draw on democratic legitimacy, the only way of restoring it is to tackle the challenges – such as economic insecurity, climate insecurity and geopolitical tensions – to which it has partly contributed, and that have undermined its claims to expertise and impartiality.
To do this, let me describe three possible ways of responding: function, form and leadership.
Three conditions for strengthening global governance
Let’s start with the function of global governance. In order to thrive, global governance must offer solutions in the areas in which people feel most at risk today. If it doesn’t, the logical response would be to erect new barriers and reverse international cooperation.
In Europe, we have already seen this process unfold. For example, when the global financial crisis and the euro crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the banking sector, some wanted to dial back on integration. But we instead collectively responded by making the EU responsible for banking supervision and by addressing the issues that had come to light.
Similarly, when Europe found itself facing another external shock in the form of a pandemic, we reacted by putting in place the European recovery plan and recovery fund (Next Generation EU). These helped to avert the threat that the virus would have a deeply unequal impact on European economies – especially those most dependent on tourism – which could have caused a new rift in our Union.
In both cases, rather than reversing economic and financial integration, we strengthened our governance to make integration more secure. We made sure that the competences of the EU matched what Europeans expect of it. In doing so, we clearly bolstered the legitimacy of the EU. Today, support for the euro and for the EU stands at 79% and 65% respectively.[8]
Can this be done with today’s challenges? The good news is that many of the issues citizens feel most insecure about are precisely the ones where they want stronger European governance.
Around two-thirds of Europeans are convinced that the European Union represents a bastion of stability in a world in crisis. Almost nine in ten Europeans agree that tackling climate change can help improve their health and well-being, and the same proportion expresses support for the environmental objectives of the European Green Deal.[9]
Citizens realise that, although some of these problems result partly from a more globalised world, the answer does not lie in turning in on ourselves, but in taking action at a level that best allows us to deal with the issues effectively. And this means deepening integration.
In the future, it will be crucial to harness this spirit of collaboration to confront new challenges in areas of common interest such as security, defence, climate or mass migration.
After function comes form. The form should mould itself to the function, creating the conditions for supranational governance to deliver on the issues prioritised by citizens.
This means great care should be taken when choosing an appropriate governance method.
We can build multilateral governance using either decentralised rules or centralised institutions. Although the first approach might appear to be the more attractive option owing to easy acceptance and because it keeps power at national level, it actually makes it more difficult to achieve governance objectives.
This is because rules are subject to a trade-off between credibility and flexibility. They are either rigid in order to be credible or vary according to circumstances in order to be flexible. But it is almost impossible to create a rule that successfully reconciles the two. All too often, attempts to find middle ground end up achieving neither.
Take the exchange rate mechanism as an example. It was created in the 1970s to stabilise exchange rates between European countries, initially operating according to strict rules that allowed a maximum fluctuation of 2.25% from the central rates. This system was severely tested in the 1980s, however, by increased capital flows and speculation. And it had to be made more flexible as a result.
But the system had to be relaxed to such an extent that it lost all credibility as a reference point for exchange rates, with fluctuation margins reaching 15% in 1993. This failure clearly showed the benefits of taking an institutional approach to European monetary integration, which then led to the adoption of the euro.
These benefits stemmed from the fact that institutions are not faced with that trade-off. When they have a clearly defined mandate and deliver on it, they become more credible. And when they have operational independence, they can be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances as they arise.
Let me illustrate this with the example of the ECB, which your President knows well and skilfully helped to develop.
Since it was created, the ECB has faced unforeseen challenges as it has carried out its mandate. But the Treaty combines our price stability mandate with discretion over the tools we can use to fulfil that mandate. This enabled us to use unconventional policy tools during the financial crisis, the recession and the pandemic to ensure that inflation remained in line with our target. Managing these complex situations would have been difficult if we had strictly adhered to fixed rules or had been limited to using conventional tools.
However, I am not naive as to the difficulties in moving from a rules-based to an institutional approach. I recognise that creating or changing institutions requires considerable political capital. This poses a challenge in specific political circumstances or situations where progress has stalled. But that cannot be used to justify inaction, because political courage can sometimes prevail over resignation and because there are other forms of governance, such as informal institutions, that can help us address the global challenges we are facing.
As COP28 is under way as I speak, let me take climate finance as an example. Numerous initiatives have emerged in this area under the aegis of the G20, providing a powerful channel for collective action in the wake of the crisis. Initiatives such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures have been set up, creating a framework encouraging companies to disclose information on the climate change-related financial risks in their economic and financial activities. Similarly, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a global coalition of leading financial institutions, has committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of the economy. And the Network for Greening the Financial System, a coalition of central banks keen to align their actions with the pressing need to tackle climate change, circulates scenarios and analyses among all its members.
Although these are voluntary actions, their widespread adoption by thousands of organisations can create powerful incentives to address the challenges we face, bringing benefits such as speed, efficiency and adaptability.
It is crucial that such initiatives are led by players with a genuine concern for the common good, because if they are not, other entities motivated by profit gains or market share could quickly fill the void, sometimes with less clear motives.
The third and final condition that I would like to mention is leadership. Even if we give governance the right function and implement it in the right form, this does not mean that the outcome will be the right one. Institutions need courageous and accountable leadership in order to take the right decisions.
Faced with complex and uncertain global challenges, the “courage to act”[10], as Ben Bernanke said, is essential. Leaders must show an unwavering determination to use all of the tools available to them, in line with their mandate, to achieve their goals.
This is a truth I have experienced throughout my entire career: as Finance Minister in France, as IMF Managing Director, and now at the helm of the ECB. Crises are insidious and unpredictable in nature, and every crisis is different. There is no textbook setting out the perfect approach to take. But time is always in short supply and risks inevitably have to be taken, while the outcome is inherently uncertain.
More recently, we faced an unprecedented crisis with the pandemic. These were extraordinary times, and the creation of the €1.85 trillion pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) to shield the economy from the impact of the pandemic was an extraordinary response. But it was necessary to combat the deflation we could have seen if we had not acted.
Effective leaders must therefore give their institutions the resources they need to act, all the while being accountable for their actions. When taking decisions that break with precedent, leaders must always keep in mind that they will have to account for those decisions. This keeps them within the limits of their mandate and focused on the public interest, and it prevents them from being tempted to go too far.
We saw this again in the case of the PEPP, as we meticulously prepared for the implementation of the programme with this in mind. We strictly complied with the requirements and safeguards considered necessary by the Court of Justice of the European Union in its judgments on our past actions, thereby ensuring that our measures were fully compatible with the Treaty.
So in striving for effective leadership, courage and accountability must go hand in hand.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
International cooperation is a powerful force that has shaped our recent history. It has brought indisputable benefits, propelling the world towards unprecedented development, creating wealth, providing access to scientific and technical progress in an increasing number of countries and building multilateral institutions that have defined the post-war era.
But it would be a mistake to disregard the challenges that have arisen on this path. Inequalities, unresolved global crises and the loss of institutions’ legitimacy have sown doubt in the minds of our fellow citizens.
This mistrust has materialised as protectionism, withdrawal, retreat and populist tendencies, eroding the foundations of supranational governance, leading to political movements seeking to regain control, and to our world fragmenting into competing blocs.
Today, the supranational governance that underpins international cooperation is at a critical turning point: either it is strengthened or it goes into decline. The choice is between a world that seeks to reconcile differences and create prosperity for all, or retreat into a world without cooperation, perhaps even one of confrontation.
I do, however, see a way forward. If supranational governance can be aligned with and focused on citizens’ priorities, take the most effective form to achieve those priorities, and be led with courage while being held accountable, then it will be able to rise to the challenge it is facing.
But we should also remember that all supranational governance structures have emerged from an era shaped by the devastating consequences of a failure to cooperate and open conflicts between countries, while deep-rooted fears were taking hold.
In these decisive moments, I am inspired by the legacy of an eminent member of the Académie française and a pioneer in the fight for women’s rights, Simone Veil.
She chose to have her ceremonial sword engraved with the number 78651, representing her deportation to Auschwitz, alongside Europe’s motto: “United in diversity”.
Let us not forget our past. Let’s work together for a fairer, more sustainable and more prosperous world. The choice before us must be guided by a shared vision of unity, cooperation and mutual respect, which our future generations deserve.
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at 5th ECB Forum on Banking Supervision ""Europe: banking on resilience"" in Frankfurt, Germany
Frankfurt, 30 November 2023
It is a pleasure to welcome you to thefifth ECB Forum on Banking Supervision.
Ten years ago, on 15 October 2013, the EU Council approved the regulation launching the Single Supervisory Mechanism. It was the most significant step in European integration since the introduction of the euro. And there were two main reasons for taking it.
First, it would lead to stricter and more uniform supervision – a single supervisor enforcing a single set of rules for a single banking market.
That would, in turn, make it possible to establish a true banking union, with a common safety net. And a banking union would strengthen the monetary union by ensuring that bank deposits were seen as equally safe everywhere.
As Andrea Enria eloquently put it, “only unified supervision and an integrated safety net can make sure that one euro has the same value and is afforded the same protection regardless of the Member State in which it is deposited”.[1]
Second, single supervision would help make monetary policy more effective, because a weak banking system can complicate our task of stabilising inflation – in both directions.
When central banks are easing policy, a fragile financial sector can impede the transmission of lower rates to the economy, especially if banks are unable to lend. We saw this after the euro crisis when banks were deleveraging as the ECB was cutting rates.
At the same time, weak banks can also interfere with rate hikes. If monetary policy gives disproportionate weight to financial stability risks, it might tighten less than it ought to.
Setting up a single supervisor was a necessary condition to achieve both these goals. But, of course, there was no guarantee of success. It had to be tested by events and shaped by leadership – notably that of Andrea and his predecessor, Danièle Nouy.
In my remarks today, I will explain how European banking supervision has brought about key improvements to the supervisory landscape and to the effectiveness of monetary policy.
The benefits of single supervision for the banking sector
Three improvements to the supervisory landscape stand out.
First, European banking supervision has led to sounder banks, thanks to supervisors enforcing tougher regulatory standards and topping them up where necessary.
The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of supervised banks stood at 15.7% in the second quarter of this year, up by 440 basis points since the start of European supervision. Banks benefit from liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios well above their minimums – at 158% and 126%, respectively. And non-performing loans fell from around €1 trillion in 2014 to below €340 billion at the end of last year.
Second, the single supervisor has made supervision more uniform, meaning that supervisory practices are now applied in a consistent way.
For example, single supervision has led to capital add-ons being applied much more consistently across banks. When European supervision began, the correlation between banks’ risk profiles and their capital requirements across Europe was just 40%. This meant that, for the same risk profile, supervisors were applying very different capital requirements. Today, however, that correlation has risen to 86%.
Third, European supervision has helped us identify common priorities in terms of risk management and address them in a forward-looking way.
Climate risks are a case in point. There is mounting evidence that the costs of delaying are substantially higher than those of a timely transition towards a more sustainable economy.[2]And without a single supervisor, these risks would likely be addressed in an inconsistent way. But thanks to European supervision, banks have been made well aware that failure to take into account the transition would be incompatible with sound risk management.
This is why last year’s thematic review required banks to shine a light on climate-related and environmental risks[3]. And it revealed that, while banks have made progress, they still have some way to go to properly incorporate these risks into their risk management frameworks.
So, even if the banking union is not yet fully complete, its first pillar – a strong and unified European supervisor – has been achieved.
Single supervision and effective monetary policy
What are the implications of this for our monetary policy?
The last few years have tested the interactions between monetary policy and banking supervision in both directions.
First, the impact of the pandemic shock required monetary policy to ease significantly in order to prevent a deflationary bust. But unlike in the previous crisis, European supervision was able to leverage the strong position of banks to sustain lending.
Supervisors provided capital and operational relief measures to banks. And this enabled banks to maximise the funds accessible through the ECB’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations to channel credit to the economy.
This joint effort was crucial to keep the economy afloat, especially while fiscal measures were still being rolled out. From March to May 2020, bank lending to companies in the euro area surged by nearly €250 billion, the largest jump we have ever seen in a three-month period.
We then faced a sequence of shocks which pushed inflation in the opposite direction. That led to the fastest monetary policy tightening in the euro area on record. We ended net asset purchases and increased rates by 450 basis points in little over a year.
This sudden reversal could have severely stressed the European banking sector – just as we saw elsewhere in the world. Indeed, research suggests that the transition from low to higher rates can negatively affect the banking system.[4]
But European supervisors have worked diligently over the past few years to help banks realign their business models, which enabled them to face the rate reversal on a solid footing.
In particular, when the ECB began normalising its monetary policy at the end of 2021, European supervision proactively prepared banks to face the risks arising from the new environment.[5]Supervisors focused on banks’ funding strategies and encouraged them to improve their management of interest rate risk. This included increased scrutiny of risks in banks’ held-to-maturity portfolios and disclosure of their unrealised losses – which turned out to be significantly lower than the unrealised losses in other parts of the world.[6]
In this way, European banking supervision has not only empowered our monetary policy response to the pandemic, but also facilitated our fight against inflation by readying banks for the new environment.
The conclusion is clear: single supervision has complemented the single monetary policy – just as theory predicted it would.
Conclusion
The 18th century English poet Alexander Pope said that “blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed”.
But a decade ago, as we emerged from the euro crisis, we did not have that luxury.
We launched European banking supervision with high expectations – not only for it to be a strong supervisor, but an essential piece of a complete monetary union.
And it has not disappointed. In fact, faced with severe tests that we could never have imagined at the time, it has exceeded most reasonable expectations.
We have a strong banking sector in Europe. It has transformed from a shock propagator into a shock absorber. And under European supervision, banks are now more alert to new risks that may lie around the corner.
So, Andrea – and everyone at European banking supervision – you can look back on a job well done. And I have great confidence that success will continue in the future."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 27 November 2023
The world has rapidly entered a period marked by compounding challenges.
A new geopolitical landscape is emerging, fuelled by mounting tensions that are fragmenting the global economy. This has direct economic consequences as it is fosteringuncertainty and economic volatility.
In parallel to this geopolitical turmoil, the climate crisis is accelerating, resulting in more frequent and unprecedented natural disasters. These extreme weather events trigger supply shocks that reverberate through the global economy, further exacerbating the existing challenges.
To navigate this shifting environment, policymakers must be open-minded. At the same time, it is critical that central banks provide an anchor of stability by delivering on their price stability mandates.
In my remarks today, I would like to briefly discuss our current assessment of the economic outlook and our efforts to bring inflation back to target. Then I will explain how the ECB incorporates climate change considerations in its monetary policy – one of the topics chosen for today's hearing.
Outlook for the euro area economy
Euro area activity has stagnated in recent quarters and is likely to remain weak for the rest of the year. Real GDP contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, reflecting a broadening impact of higher interest rates, weak foreign demand and the fading impetus from the reopening of the economy after the pandemic.
Manufacturing output has continued to fall and activity in the services sector is weakening further. Despite the slowdown in activity, the labour market remains resilient overall, although there are some signs that job growth may lose momentum towards the end of the year.
While the short-term outlook remains subdued, the economy is set to strengthen again over the coming years as inflation falls further, household real incomes recover and the demand for euro area exports picks up.
Let me now turn to inflation, which fell further to 2.9% in October. This fall reflected a general decline in inflation but was also helped by what we call base effects.[1]These effects were particularly visible in the low rate of energy inflation, which stood at -11.2%. Food inflation has also declined but is likely to remain strong for the rest of the year. This contrasts with inflation developments in the United States – the first topic chosen for today’s hearing – where food inflation has been more contained, while core inflation picked up faster after the pandemic.
Inflation excluding energy and food has continued to moderate. It fell to 4.2% in October owing to declines in both goods and services inflation. Most other measures of underlying inflation have also come down. At the same time, the ECB’s indicator of domestic inflation – which excludes items with a high import content– has not come down by much, reflecting the fact that inflation is now driven more by domestic sources than by external sources.
Wage pressures, meanwhile, remain strong. Our current assessment is that this mainly reflects “catch-up” effects related to past inflation rather than a self-fulfilling dynamic. And we expect wages to continue to be a key factor driving domestic inflation. At the same time, the contribution of profits – which accounted for much of the strong domestic price pressures seen recently – is now weakening.
Looking ahead, we expect the weakening of inflationary pressures to continue, even though headline inflation may rise again slightly in the coming months, mainly owing to some base effects. However, the medium-term outlook for inflation remains surrounded by considerable uncertainty.
The ECB’s monetary policy
Turning to monetary policy, we remain determined to ensure the timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.
In October we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, and we expect that maintaining interest rates at current levels for a sufficiently long duration will make a substantial contribution to restoring price stability.
Our future decisions will ensure that policy rates are set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. The appropriate level and duration of restriction will continue to be determined in a data-dependent manner, assessing the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The Governing Council will reassess its monetary policy stance in mid-December, informed by new data and updated projections, including for 2026.
Climate change considerations in monetary policy
Let me now turn to the other topic you have selected for today’s hearing – climate change in monetary policy implementation.
Climate-related disasters are becoming more frequent and more severe. This year’s catastrophic floods in Slovenia, Italy, Greece and France are a stark reminder of this.
At the same time, the warming of our climate continues. July and August 2023 were the two warmest months on record globally and the planet is now on track to reach average warming of 1.5 ºC by the 2030s.[2]
In today’s challenging geopolitical environment, it is easy to lose sight of this unfolding climate crisis. But we must remain committed to supporting the green transition.
European governments are primarily responsible for addressing climate change. They have the authority, tools and ability to implement the appropriate policies to tackle this crisis.
That said, climate change and the protection of the environment are also relevant for the ECB – from the perspective of both our primary and secondary objectives. The ECB therefore remains committed, within its mandate, to playing its part.[3]
First and foremost by ensuring that we fulfil our primary objective of price stability.
Large investments in green technologies are needed to support the transition. And a stable inflation outlook gives firms visibility on investment costs, which is particularly important for green projects in light of their mostly long-term planning horizon.
Price stability also supports the relative price signal from policies such as carbon pricing, thereby making those policies more efficient.
Over the past years, we have enhanced our understanding of the economic and financial ramifications of climate change. We published a set of climate-related indicators to improve the quality and quantity of climate-related data.[4]As climate-related data improve, we are also working to further enhance ourmacroeconomic models, scenario analyses and risk assessment. This helps us better account for climate risks and the implications that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy may have.
As it is relevant to our primary mandate, we are also working to better take into account climate-related financial risk in the Eurosystem’s balance sheet. In doing so, we are also following our secondary objective, by supporting the green transition of the economy, in line with the EU’s climate neutrality objectives.
In the implementation of our monetary policy, for instance, our tilting activities have helped decarbonise our corporate bond holdings, and we continue to tilt our reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme.[5]
We recently concluded our one-year review of the tilting framework, and we expect the decarbonisation of our corporate sector portfolios to continue throughout 2023 and 2024 on a path that supports the goals of the Paris Agreement.There are three main factors driving this decarbonisation process. First, the effectiveness of our tilting approach. Second, redemptions of bonds with a relatively high carbon impact. And third, we see that issuers of the bonds we hold are actively working to reduce their carbon footprint, with benefits for society at large.
Looking beyond 2024, the Governing Council is committed to considering ways to ensure the further decarbonisation of our corporate portfolios on a path that supports the Paris Agreement objectives, without prejudice to our price stability objective. We will continue to review our climate actions to ensure that they remain fit for purpose, focusing on the areas where the risks are greatest and our work contributes the most.
Conclusion
Let me now conclude.
As we enter a new era of heightened geopolitical tensions and an unfolding climate crisis, we need to step up our efforts to make our economies more resilient.
Progress on the green transition, including to accelerate Europe’s energy independence, is essential as it will reduce the likelihood of higher and more volatile energy prices.
Deepening the capital markets union, reaching an agreement on a sound fiscal framework and addressing regulatory barriers are equally crucial to foster investment and speed up the development of renewables.
The ECB will play its part, first and foremost by ensuring that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target.
This is not the time to start declaring victory. We need to remain attentive to the different forces affecting inflation and firmly focused on our mandate of price stability."

Speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Bertelsmann Stiftung, Berlin
Frankfurt am Main, 22 November 2023
The concept ofStabilitätskultur, or culture of stability, was first used by former Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger in 1991. In coining this phrase, he wanted to emphasise that stable money – the remit of central banks − not only required a stability-oriented policy from the central bank, but also from the government and society at large.
In the face of the current climate and nature crises, Schlesinger’s insight that stability-oriented institutions cannot pursue their objectives in isolation could hardly be more relevant. The Emissions Gap Report published by the UN earlier this week concludes that the world is on a global heating path of 3°C, far above the Paris Agreement objective of well below 2°C.[1]And earlier studies have shown that 25% of species are vulnerable and an estimated one million species face a risk of extinction.[2]Today I will convey that a culture of stability can only be preserved if climate and nature are stable. Most central banks and banking supervisors around the world have acknowledged this in recent years. And the ECB is putting it into practice in all its tasks and responsibilities, including our banking supervision and our monetary policy, the latter being the focus of my remarks today.
Taking climate and nature into account
As I have often said before and will reiterate today to remove any possibly remaining doubt: central banks and supervisors like the ECB are not, and do not intend to be, climate and nature policymakers.[3]Moreover, as an independent central bank, the ECB is not directly bound by the European Climate Law that since 2021 has committed the EU to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 with interim deadlines. This does not mean, however, that the ECB is allowed to ignore the Climate Law. The EU Treaty requires environmental protection to be integrated into the definition and implementation of EU policies. The Treaty imposes an obligation on us to take into account the objectives of climate and nature-related legislation when performing our monetary policy and banking supervision tasks.[4]
This is not just a legal reality. The massive impact of the climate and nature crises on the economy, including the financial system, makes it crystal clear that we must take climate and nature into account. In fact, if we didn’t do so, we would risk failing to deliver on our mandate.
The relevance of climate and nature for monetary policy[5]
At least five economic consequences of the climate and nature crises are specifically relevant to monetary policy and our primary objective of maintaining price stability.
First, we can expect macroeconomic volatility – including the volatility of inflation – to increase further as climate and nature events occur more frequently and have a greater impact on the economy.
Second, climate and nature shocks complicate monetary policy analysis and make it harder to assess the appropriate monetary policy response. Whether we are dealing with more frequent extreme weather events and nature degradation or actions to support the green transition, climate and nature events may largely materialise in the form of supply shocks, implying that economic activity and inflation move in opposite directions. Generally speaking, as supply shocks involve a potential trade-off, they are more challenging for central banks than demand shocks. If supply shocks persistently affect inflation, they may generate risks for price stability and so trigger a change to monetary policy  that would further dampen economic activity. If, however, supply shocks are temporary and pose no risk to medium-term price stability, central banks can look through them and avoid slowing down the economy.
Third, the ongoing climate and nature crises may cause the equilibrium rate of interest to fall. The equilibrium rate is the interest rate that prevails when all shocks to the economy have dissipated and monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. Greater uncertainty owing to the climate and nature crises and the necessity to build up resilience to shocks can increase economic agents’ propensity to save, thereby lowering the equilibrium interest rate. A lower equilibrium rate implies that future monetary policy could come up against the effective lower bound for interest rates more often, though the more frequent occurrence of negative supply shocks that I referred to earlier may mitigate this effect to some extent.
Fourth, financial risks arising from climate and nature crises can impair the soundness of financial institutions. Should these risks materialise – despite all our efforts as a banking supervisor to mitigate them[6]– the transmission of our monetary policy could be affected. Monetary policy decisions would be transmitted through the financial system and the economy in a less orderly and less predictable manner, potentially hampering our effectiveness in achieving our price stability objective.
Fifth, the risks that may affect financial institutions can also undermine the solidity of the central bank balance sheet. Unlike commercial banks, central banks are not profit-seeking and only expose themselves to financial risks if helpful in achieving price stability. This is especially true when such risks can cause financial losses that could erode confidence in the central bank’s ability to deliver price stability. Prudent central banks will thus seek to avoid any climate and nature-related financial risks that do not contribute to price stability.
I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that seeking exposures to climate and nature-related financial risks might help in securing and maintaining price stability. On the contrary, available evidence suggests the opposite is true. In fact, when we align our portfolios with the market status quo of high exposure to climate and nature-related financial risks, we risk adding to macroeconomic volatility. As already mentioned, this would make it harder to achieve the monetary policy goal of price stability.
To summarise, in the pursuit of price stability, central banks benefit from mitigation of climate and nature-related risks, which – as analysis consistently shows − is best ensured by securing a timely and orderly transition.[7]
The ECB’s climate actions so far
Against this backdrop, in 2021 the ECB explicitly acknowledged that climate change had profound implications for price stability through its impact on the structure and cyclical dynamics of the economy and the financial system. In the case of the ECB, actions on climate equally serve our secondary objective, as also laid down in the EU Treaties, of supporting the general economic policies in the EU, which include the EU’s climate objectives. Accordingly, we unveiled an ambitious climate action plan covering macroeconomic modelling, financial stability monitoring, data collection, risk assessment capabilities and our monetary policy operations.
And this wasn’t just a plan. We delivered on it, just like we said we would. Let me give you some specific examples of how we have put into practice what were still mere ambitions back in 2021.
First, we have made significant progress in improving our capabilities to take climate considerations into account in the macroeconomic analyses that inform our monetary policy assessment. For example, we can now use a suite of macroeconomic models to analyse the economic consequences of the green transition in the euro area. Using this suite of models, staff have found that an increase in carbon pricing in line with the International Energy Agency’s net-zero scenarios may have a limited impact on economic growth and inflation.[8]The analysis also suggests that due to the low substitutability of non-sustainable and sustainable consumption, the carbon price path envisaged by the Agency may not actually be sufficient to achieve net-zero objectives. This implies that either carbon prices would need to increase further, or that additional regulation would be required, or a combination of both. Again, we would need to be ready to take into account any monetary policy implications that could arise as a result.
Acknowledging that climate factors can have an impact on our monetary policy assessment is not just “what-if” thinking. ECB research shows that the related effects are already materialising. For example, ECB staff estimates suggest that the heatwave in 2022 pushed upfood price inflation by up to 0.67 percentage points, with the impact lasting well into 2023.[9]Thanks to our enhanced analytical capabilities, earlier this year we were able to acknowledge for the first time – in our monetary policy statement issued after the Governing Council meeting – that climate factors posed an upside risk to the inflation outlook.[10]
Second, between October 2022 and July 2023 we started tilting our reinvestments of corporate bonds towards issuers that have a better climate performance. In so doing, we can avoid undue exposures to climate-related risks that are detrimental to price stability and align the way we administer our monetary policy more closely with the EU’s general economic policies. As of July 2023 we suspended bond purchases in our asset purchase programme, including corporate bonds, to support the downward pressure exerted by our current policy rates in order to bring inflation back to our 2% target. If required from a monetary policy perspective, the established direction of the tilt will set the minimum benchmark for any future corporate bond purchases.[11]
In addition to our bond holdings, we are also looking at the collateral framework that we apply in relation to banks’ participation in our lending operations. We have decided that only assets that comply with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will remain eligible once it enters into force. In addition, we are now looking at setting limits on the share of assets issued by entities with a high carbon footprint that banks can pledge as collateral for our lending operations.
Some avenues that we explored did not result in us having to make any changes. When we reviewed the resilience of the haircuts that we apply to collateral valuation, we did not find any evidence that the existing scheme provides insufficient protection against climate-related financial risks over the horizon for which these haircuts should provide protection.[12]We will continue to evaluate this in the future as and when better data become available.
Our current actions aim to support a high degree of confidence in the alignment of our activities with the goals set by the Paris Agreement within our mandate. However, the decarbonisation path for our monetary policy assets remains dependent on actions that are not fully under our control, including the decarbonisation efforts made by the issuers of bonds that we hold.
Evaluating, adapting and broadening our actions to include nature
This is one of the main reasons why we have made a commitment to regularly review all our measures to assess their impact. If necessary, we will adapt them to ensure they continue to fulfil their monetary policy objectives and support the decarbonisation path to reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement and the EU climate neutrality objectives. Moreover, we will also look into addressing additional environmental challenges within our mandate. Even if the legislative environment on nature preservation is trailing behind that on climate change – in spite of the landmark Nature Restoration Law – our initial analyses show that nature-related risks are highly relevant for the European economy and financial system. Out of 4.2 million firms that we looked at, around three million are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service, services provided by nature that are significantly subject to degradation.[13]
Besides making continued efforts to further enhance our analytical capabilities and deliver on our data needs, what else should we include when we assess our actions? Given the prevailing inflation outlook and the need for us to continue to implement a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy to bring inflation sustainably back to our 2% target, we do not expect to expand our balance sheet again anytime soon. However, that doesn’t mean that we don’t need to continue re-evaluating the fitness of the instruments we have in our toolkit in case policy adjustments are required. Moreover, in proceeding with the rundown of our balance sheet, we need to think about which features we would like to maintain in a steady state.
Our monetary policy strategy enables us to think about both questions. Specifically, whenever we are faced with two configurations of the set of instruments that would be equally conducive to maintaining price stability, we will and legally must choose the one that best supports the general economic policies in the EU. This implies that whenever we make a marginal adjustment to the calibration of our instruments, we must choose the option that increases our confidence in the plausibility of our decarbonisation path, unless our proportionality assessment shows that there are other, less intrusive ways of achieving price stability.
Looking ahead, besides the adjustments that we are already implementing, I think this principle may require us to consider two further avenues.
The first concerns our public sector bond holdings. Here we can apply reasoning very similar to that applied to our corporate bond holdings. Currently, the bulk of our monetary policy assets consists of bonds issued by governments of EU Member States. However, the climate and nature-related risk intensity of these bonds is not obvious owing to the absence of a clear and reliable framework to assess their compatibility with the Paris Agreement. At the same time, since the pandemic, the universe of supranational bonds issued by EU institutions has increased significantly, with green bonds representing a relatively large proportion.[14]In my view, when there is no clear monetary policy rationale for preferring domestic sovereign bonds, we should contemplate increasing the share of EU supranational bonds in our total bond holdings to avoid potential climate and nature-related risks and to better align our balance sheet with the general economic policies in the EU. Not only is this relevant for when we would need to consider new bond purchases. It is also relevant when we need to discuss the composition of any structural bond portfolio that we might maintain in the new steady state.
Second, whenever there is a monetary policy need in the future to reconsider targeted longer-term refinancing operations for banks, there are compelling reasons to seriously consider greening them. A parallel can be drawn with the way that the ECB has in the past incorporated financial stability considerations into the design of its instruments. As of the third series that was launched in 2019, the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) that we offered banks comprised a lending target that excluded housing loans to avoid contributing to the formation of real estate bubbles.[15]Similar targeting strategies can be considered to support green lending or exclude non-green lending in the future, provided an operationally efficient validation process is feasible.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Alexander von Humboldt, a pioneer in ecology among many other things, once said, “The most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those who have never looked at the world.”
If we transpose this to the central bank’s worldview – and to that of the banking supervision arm – the risk of not delivering on our mandate is real if we don’t take climate and nature into consideration. Preserving price stability means preserving climate and nature stability. It is our mandate. It is our culture.Unsere Stabilitätskultur.

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the high-level public discussion “Inflation kills democracy” on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the currency reform in Germany in 1923, organised by the German Ministry of Finance in Berlin, Germany
Berlin, 21 November 2023
The story of Germany in the years after the First World War is a striking reminder of how price stability and democracy go hand in hand.
The historian Gerald Feldman famously called those troubled years “the Great Disorder”.[1]And although the relative contributions of the hyperinflation of the 1920s and the deflation of the 1930s are still debated, there is little doubt that wild swings in prices eroded the economic foundations of democracy.
One of the ways in which price instability does this is by triggering large distributional effects, which often hurt the poorest in society the most. For example, ECB analysis finds that the spike in inflation over the last 18 months has disproportionately affected low-income households as they spend more of their income on necessities like energy and food, which saw surging prices.[2]
These are fundamental reasons why, in most liberal democracies, central banks have been entrusted with mandates to preserve price stability. And at the ECB, we will never compromise on our mandate. That is why, in response to rising inflation, we raised interest rates at the fastest pace in our history, by 450 basis points in just over a year. And we will return inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner.
However, having made such a large and fast adjustment, we are in a phase of our policy cycle which I would characterise as being “attentive and focused”.
We need to be attentive to the different forces affecting inflation: the unwinding of past energy shocks, the strength of monetary policy transmission, the dynamics of wages and the evolution of inflation expectations. And we need to remain focused on bringing inflation back to our target, and not rush to premature conclusions based on short-term developments.
The forces pushing down inflation
There are two main forces pushing down inflation today.
First, the energy and supply chain shocks which played a substantial role in last year’s inflation surge are now unwinding.
At its peak, energy and food accounted for more than two-thirds of headline inflation in the euro area, despite representing less than one-third of the consumption basket. And together with supply chain disruptions, this also had a sizeable effect on core inflation – inflation excluding food and energy – as input costs rose for firms across the economy.[3]
So, it is not surprising that as supply chains heal and energy prices fall, we are seeing the reverse effect, and both headline and core inflation are coming down.
We expect headline inflation to rise again slightly in the coming months, mainly owing to some base effects. This reflects the sizeable drops in energy costs observed around the turn of last year, and the reversal of some of the fiscal measures that were put in place to fight the energy crisis. But we should see a further weakening of overall inflationary pressures.
The second force is the impact of our monetary policy tightening.
We had to tighten monetary policy forcefully to bring demand into line with supply and keep inflation expectations anchored while inflation surged. And this policy adjustment has fed quickly into financing conditions. But its peak impact on inflation will only materialise with a lag – and given the unprecedented scale and speed of our tightening, there is some uncertainty about how strong this effect will be.
So, we need to be attentive to how these forces are working through the economy. But given the scale of our policy adjustment, we can now allow some time for them to unfold.
That is why, at our last meeting, we held interest rates at their present levels. And based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to returning inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner.
Avoiding persistent inflation
But this is not the time to start declaring victory. The nature of the inflation process in the euro area means that we will need to remain attentive to the risks of persistent inflation as well.
As wage-setting in the euro area is multi-annual and staggered, the high inflation rates that are now behind us are still having a significant influence on wage agreements today. For example, the annual growth rate[4]of compensation per employee was 5.6% in the second quarter of 2023, a 1.2 percentage point increase compared with the average for 2022.
And the ability of workers to obtain higher wages is being supported by a tight labour market and strong demand for labour, which has proven surprisingly resilient to a slowing economy since the end of 2022.
For now, our assessment is that strong wage growth mainly reflects “catch-up” effects related to past inflation, rather than a self-fulfilling dynamic where people expect higher inflation in the future. But to assess how wages are evolving and whether they pose a risk to price stability, we will be closely monitoring a number of developments.
First, whether firms absorb rising wages in their profit margins[5], which would allow real wages to recover some of their past losses without the increase being fully passed through to inflation.
Second, whether there is some easing of labour market tightness, which would prevent excess demand for labour from becoming a driver of persistently high wage demands.
And third, that inflation expectations remain anchored, which ensures that, when the current shock passes, wage and price-setting will be guided by our 2% inflation target.
In other words, we will need to remain attentive until we have firm evidence that the conditions are in place for inflation to return sustainably to our goal.
That is why we have said our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. And we have made those future decisions conditional on the incoming data, meaning that we can act again if we see rising risks of missing our inflation target.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
We have faced a major inflation shock and we have made a major policy adjustment in response. The effects of that adjustment are increasingly being felt and inflation pressures are easing.
But there is still a journey ahead of us.
Our monetary policy is in a phase where we need to be attentive to the different forces affecting inflation – but always firmly focused on our mandate of price stability."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the European Banking Congress
Frankfurt am Main, 17 November 2023
In 1844, the American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson observed that “railroad iron is a magician’s rod in its power to evoke the sleeping energies of land and water.”[1]
What he saw was that railroads could substantially increase the economic potential of the United States. And he was proven right in many ways.
The railroads not only linked up the far-flung corners of the United States; they also linked up its capital markets. The need to finance this project of unprecedented scale radically transformed the US financial system, changing its destiny forever.
Today, Europe is at a similar juncture.
We have emerged strongly from a series of profound economic shocks: real GDP is only 2% lower today than we expected at the end of 2019.[2]But we are facing a new set of challenges that will require a generational effort to finance.
So, this morning I will focus on how we can achieve this, and in particular on how to make Europe’s capital markets more supportive.
I will argue that a capital markets union (CMU) is an indispensable project in this context that we have so far failed to advance, for two reasons.
First, if we look at historical examples, it is clear that the conditions for capital markets to develop in Europe have not yet been satisfied. Most importantly, we have lacked a unifying project around which CMU can be anchored. But this is now changing.
And second, perhaps because we have lacked such a project, we have relied too much on a “bottom-up” approach to integration. The solution, in my view, is to make a “Kantian shift” in our approach to CMU.
Immanuel Kant turned philosophy on its head by asserting that, instead of the world creating our perception, it is our perception – the product of our human mind – that defines how we experience the world. In the same way, we can turn our approach to CMU on its head, so that it can become a vital tool in financing the ongoing transformations.
Lessons from history for the CMU
To start, what does history teach us about how capital markets develop?
The most important lesson is that a capital markets union emerges when there is a need to finance an economic transformation that exceeds the capacities of fragmented financial markets.
The US railroad example is a perfect illustration of this. In the 19th century, the US financial market was extremely fragmented, as individual states limited the chartering of banks. And this created a fundamental mismatch in the economy.
The United States had a “single market” in goods and services – fortified by the Commerce Clause – which meant that firms could grow to national scale. But the banking system was not operating on a similar scale, so it could not meet the financing needs this created.
This problem was particularly acute in the case of the railroads, because loans to railway projects were high risk and there were frequent defaults. No local US bank could diversify these risks in its loan portfolio, and transaction costs made loan syndication prohibitively expensive.
So, entrepreneurs and investors filled the gap. Railroads were seen as so critical for the future of the country that capital markets were developed to tap a deeper pool of domestic and foreign investors.
Measured in 1909 US dollars, investment in the railroads increased from around 90 million in the 1830s to almost 5 billion in the early 1900s. Most of the finance took the form of bonds, and up to one-third of it came from foreign investors.[3]
Seen from this perspective, one of the reasons why CMU has not yet succeeded is clear.
Since CMU became an EU policy goal nearly a decade ago, its stated objectives have tended to prioritise the stabilising benefits of integrated capital markets. We have focused on increasing private sector risk-sharing to make the monetary union more resilient, or having a “spare tyre” during banking crises to make the financial sector more resilient.
These worthy objectives owed much to the circumstances in which the CMU agenda emerged, which was in the aftermath of the great financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis. But these are just some of the welcome side effects of integrated capital markets; they are not the main effects.
If we take the United States as an example – and I should note that the United Kingdom followed a similar path[4]– there needs to be a greater common goal. And over the last decade, Europe has not only lacked this greater common goal, but governments and firms everywhere were in fact cutting back on investment.
The EU at a critical juncture
But the situation today is very different. In many ways,we now face similar questions to those the United States was confronted with in the 19th century.
Europe is facing a series of common challenges, with the “three Ds” of deglobalisation, demographics and decarbonisation looming larger.
There are increasing signs that the global economy is fragmenting into competing blocs.[5]
We are approaching a long-anticipated demographic tipping point: in the euro area, a continuous decline in the working age population, so those aged 15 to 64, looks set to begin as early as 2025.
And the impact of climate disasters is increasing every year, as is the need for climate action.
Addressing all these challenges at the same time will require a generational effort – and massive investment is needed in a short space of time.
As new trade barriers appear, we will need to reassess supply chains and invest in new ones that are safer, more efficient and closer to home. As our societies age, we will need to deploy new technologies so that we can produce greater output with fewer workers.[6]Digitalisation will help. And as our climate warms, we will need to advance the green transition without any further delays.
To give a sense of the volumes involved, the European Commission estimates that the green transition alone will require additional investment of €620 billion every year, on average, until 2030, and a further €125 billion per year will be needed for the digital transition.[7]
Just like in the United States in the 19th century, it is clear that we cannot rely on our existing framework to finance this investment.
Governments have the highest debt levels since the Second World War, and European recovery funding will end in 2026. Banks will have a central role to play, but we cannot expect them to take on so much risk on their balance sheets.
This brings me to the capital markets union.
Despite two European Commission action plans, Europe’s capital market remains fragmented. Financial integration is lower than before the financial crisis. Bond markets are three times smaller than in the United States. And EU venture capital lags significantly behind the United States, at just one-fifth of the size.[8]
We will not succeed in these transitions if we don’t get CMU back on track. And there are two ways in particular in which Europe is being held back.
First, existing firms that want to digitalise or decarbonise cannot access the full amount of financing they need. To give an example, in a recent ECB survey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), nearly 40% of respondents considered the lack of investor willingness to finance green investment to be a very significant obstacle.[9]
The issue here is not only that SMEs cannot tap capital markets, but also that the lack of capital market development affectsbanks’ability to grant riskier loans.
A genuine CMU would mean building a sufficiently large securitisation market, allowing banks to transfer some risk to investors, release capital and unlock additional lending. In the United States, banks have access to a securitisation market that is three times the size of Europe’s. This could be even more powerful in our bank-based financial system.
Second, underdeveloped capital markets mean that the young, disruptive firms that drive innovation have less access to the quality of financing they need.
Today, European start-ups attract less than half the funding of their US counterparts[10], while the volume of investments in scale-ups in the United States is more than four times greater than in Europe.[11]However, analysis shows that the rapid development of CMU could lead to an additional 4,800 companies across Europe raising an extra €535 billion a year.[12]
The ingredients for success
What are the key ingredients for success? Let me point to two.
First, for a project of this magnitude to succeed, the unwavering determination of all actors - in both the public and private sectors – is crucial.
While the US railroads depended on the will of entrepreneurs and investors, they also had substantial political backing. In fact, Abraham Lincoln said that “there is nothing more important before the nation than the building of the railroad to the Pacific”.
So what we need today is for all parties to rally around this project, recognising that the future prosperity of Europe depends on it.
The second key ingredient is for our shared determination to be embodied in a change of approach.
So far, there has been a “bottom-up” approach to implementing CMU. The focus has been on developing local and regional capital markets to overcome the limitations of small domestic settings, and then removing the barriers to those markets being integrated further.
Piecemeal changes to legislation have systematically tackled obstacles or inconsistencies in areas ranging from clearing systems and sustainability disclosures to retail investment and investment funds – with some notable successes.[13]
But it is clear that this strategy has not provided sufficient incentives for stakeholders to build a European market. For instance, while the European equity market is less than half the size of the US equity market, it has three times as many exchange groups. And there are roughly 20 times as many post-trade infrastructure providers. This reduces market depth and liquidity and, as a result, makes it more difficult to develop larger capital markets.
The bottom-up approach has also not led to harmonisation in the policy areas that could really move the needle in terms of breaking down cross-border barriers.
For example, despite some efforts to harmonise insolvency frameworks, there are no common rules on the ranking of credit claims or on the conditions for initiating insolvency proceedings. This discourages investors from investing in firms in different Member States and hinders the development of liquid secondary markets for distressed assets.
So it is time to enact what I call a “Kantian shift” – and to move from a bottom-up approach to a top-down one.
Even though the US capital market developed organically in response to a need for funding, establishing appropriate institutions was critical to sustain it. Indeed, the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the 1930s played a pivotal role in suppressing state efforts to fragment securities markets.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) does some of that in the EU, but it is not trulysingle. Supervision remains largely at the national level, which fragments the application of EU rules. In fact, enforcement powers are often split across several national regulators.
Creating a European SEC, for example by extending the powers of ESMA, could be the answer. It would need a broad mandate, including direct supervision, to mitigate systemic risks posed by large cross-border firms and market infrastructures such as EU central counterparties.
But beyond a strong institution, a single rulebook is also key – a lesson we have learned in the banking sector. Before the great financial crisis, an approach based on minimum harmonisation led to a weak regulatory framework, creating an uneven playing field and enabling shallow, reversible financial integration.[14]
By contrast, when the banking union was launched, the development of a single rulebook – a set of unified, directly applicable rules for all banks – levelled the playing field.
To mitigate fragmentation in EU capital markets, a more ambitious approach should involve the creation of a single rulebook enforced by a unified supervisor. That would empower private entities to expand their ambitions in fostering high-growth private investments.
Finally, a truly European capital market needs consolidated market infrastructures – and this is where the private sector can show its determination, too.
The creation of a European consolidated tape[15]can encourage a shift towards larger, cross-border integrated market infrastructure and exchange groups. Research shows that stock markets that are part of wider groups perform better in terms of depth, IPO activity and liquidity, and this group effect proves to be particularly powerful for smaller exchanges.[16]
Conclusion
Let me conclude by returning to the wisdom of Immanuel Kant.
He once expressed the idea ofdoing the right thing because it is right. But he was also clear that, in order to act in this way, one must operate first from a foundation of goodwill.
We can apply the same principle to the development of a true CMU today. The foundation of goodwill is there – policymakers, banks and investors all want this project to succeed. What we need to do now is build on this goodwill and go further, otherwise we risk jeopardising Europe’s ability to deal with the challenges on the horizon.
I have argued that there is a compelling collective interest in taking a more ambitious European approach to establishing a capital markets union. In the changing circumstances we face today, where the challenges of deglobalisation, demographics and decarbonisation are looming larger, integrated capital markets are integral to our success.
Some will argue that, unless we start issuing common EU bonds that will ultimately constitute a European safe asset, and parallel US Treasury bonds, this project will not succeed.
But even if this is correct, it should not stop us from working on the many other areas that are necessary for CMU to become a reality. The lesson of European integration is that we have to take the steps that are in front of us, when the moment arises, and then the others will eventually follow.
Faced with such an immense financing challenge, the moment for action is now. So I encourage all of us to be bold and not to let this moment pass."

Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2023
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the seventh annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).[1]
Societies throughout history have always found ways to alert people to the potential materialisation of risks so they have time to successfully pre-empt them.
Some methods were simpler than others. In the Middle Ages, for example, village bells were rung to raise the alarm.[2]But today, the complexity of our economy means that risks can appear from all angles, and the task of signalling them is often assigned to expert bodies. The ESRB was set up precisely to identify the risks emanating from an interconnected financial system that national actors might not see.
Just over twelve months ago, the ESRB published a “general warning” about financial stability risks, addressed to all European Union and national supervisory authorities.[3]This was the first such warning in its 13-year history – and a clear call to action.
One year on, we can begin to take stock of that general warning, with two important questions coming to the fore.
First, to what extent have the risks that we described materialised so far? And second, how impactful has the general warning been in increasing the financial system’s resilience?
The materialisation of risks
We issued our general warning in September 2022 – a time of exceptionally high uncertainty. The Russian invasion of Ukraine had combined with other factors to increase the likelihood of tail risk scenarios materialising.[4]
Europe was facing the risk of drastic shortages of gas and oil as winter approached. And the sharp shift from a decade of very low rates to higher rates in a short space of time – necessary to fight rising inflation – also risked exposing financial imbalances and sparking substantial market volatility.
At the time, we warned that all the risks we foresaw could materialise simultaneously and amplify each other’s impact. Fortunately, this scenario has so far not come to pass. But some specific risks we identified have since partially materialised.
First, we expressed concern that households and companies would see their debt servicing capacity affected. While employment has remained resilient so far, households’ real disposable income has come under significant pressure due to high inflation.
Second, we highlighted risks stemming from a sharp fall in asset prices. We saw these partially materialise with the failure of US-based regional banks, the gilt crisis in the United Kingdom, and more recently in the price fluctuations of US Treasury bonds.
But there are other risks that have not yet materialised.
We warned that a deteriorating economy could threaten the asset quality and profitability of credit institutions. Yet EU banks now benefit from higher levels of profitability than at any point in the past decade. Non-performing loans (NPLs) remain low, supported by stable employment levels. And residential real estate markets – a key exposure for banks – have been slowing down but in an orderly fashion so far.
However, our view remains that all relevant institutions will need to continue to take action to prevent these risks from materialising over the medium term.
Bank profitability will be adversely affected by the rise in funding costs, reflecting higher policy rates, and by much lower lending volumes. And the enduring combination of low growth and higher debt servicing costs will continue to strain vulnerable households and firms, which could see NPLs rising.
Moreover, the list of vulnerable nodes in our financial system remains long – for example, money market funds and investment funds, notably those investing in illiquid assets. And channels of contagion could still re-emerge. In particular, the margin policies of central counterparty clearing houses could amplify stress in the system. EU banks’ holdings of fixed income securities could be marked down quite significantly, should they need to be sold.
It would be unwise to be complacent. The ESRB will therefore continue to monitor developments carefully.
The impact of the general warning so far
How impactful has the warning been in increasing the financial system’s resilience after one year?
We addressed our general warning to all EU and national supervisory authorities in the banking and non-banking financial sectors. These authorities interact frequently with their supervised or regulated entities, which in turn take thousands of risk management decisions every day.
This makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact effect of our general warning in this vast ecosystem. But we can still understand its impact across two dimensions: awareness and action.
It is precisely because we stand at the heart of this ecosystem that we can create a broad awareness of the risks that we identify. While by law we could only issue the warning to public institutions and not to the general public, it was reiterated across this network.
Awareness has acted as a catalyst for action, too. The warning has enabled policymakers and supervisors to anchor their decisions to our assessment and has helped them to push through necessary reforms to their macroprudential and microprudential policies.
And ESRB warnings also work in more subtle ways, not only as a catalyst but also as an inhibitor: they may help slow down decision-making and so avert hasty risk management decisions; supervisors may pause for longer in assessing whether an institution’s vulnerabilities are critical; and policymakers might more strongly resist calls for watering down legislation.
So our assessment is that the general warning has indeed proved impactful over the past year. The ESRB’s words have clearly worked towards reducing policymakers’ “inaction bias” with regard to the implementation of macroprudential policy.[5]
On the other hand, our work is not yet finished. But I am firmly convinced that the joint action of the EU financial stability community at large will be sustained and unwavering, so that our warning will have helped to avoid damage to the economy.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
To date, Europe’s financial system has avoided the worst-case scenario of severe systemic risks materialising at the same time. But policymakers need to remain proactive and alert to financial stability risks as and when they arise. As Abraham Lincoln once observed, “Leave nothing for tomorrow which can be done today.”
And turning to today’s conference, I have no doubt it will provide for a stimulating discussion about how macroprudential policy can help us best tackle the financial stability challenges that lie ahead of us.
With this, I now open the seventh ESRB conference."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the conference on “The decade of sustainable finance: half-time evaluation” organised by S&D and QED
Brussels, 14 November 2023
Just over a month ago, Kenyan athlete Kelvin Kiptum completed the Chicago marathon in a stunning two hours and thirty-five seconds – a new official world record. Halfway through the course, however, it wasn’t at all clear that Kiptum was on track to set this record. He was lagging behind the previous record set by his compatriot Eliud Kipchoge in Berlin in 2022. But by completing the second half of his marathon almost a full minute faster than the first half – achieving what is known in running as a negative split – he managed to break the world record by 34 seconds and get closer to the elusive two-hour mark than anyone had done previously in an official race.[1]
As a number, “two” seems to have a particular appeal in many fields beyond marathon running. At the ECB, for example, we consider that price stability is best maintained by aiming for 2% inflation over the medium term. Meanwhile, climate scientists consider two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as the global heating threshold beyond which extreme weather events and the degradation of ecosystems would be disastrous for humankind. In the Paris Agreement, global leaders committed to staying well below those two degrees of global heating. And it is the figure the High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance – which I took part in – had in mind when drawing up its recommendations on sustainable finance in 2018.
This conference marks the halfway point in what was envisaged to be a decade for sustainable finance, building on the high-level group’s recommendations. And at this half-time juncture, I am sorry to say that it is not at all certain that humankind will remain below that disastrous threshold of two degrees of global heating. But Kelvin Kiptum’s recent world record provides hope. It shows that, by pushing for a negative split, great achievements are possible. In other words, we can deliver on our commitments to limit global heating in line with the Paris Agreement, provided that solid foundations have already been laid in the first half of the decade and on the – admittedly extremely challenging – condition that we run at a world record-breaking pace in the second half.
Mapping the course
Such foundations start with a clear road map for achieving our objectives. In other words, a clear strategy setting out the milestones on the path to Paris.
Here, there is no doubt that the responsible EU authorities have delivered. The Paris Agreement has been transposed into the European Climate Law, which includes a commitment to the ultimate objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as interim objectives for reductions in emissions by 2030 and 2040. The commitment to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 is further reinforced in the EU’s Fit for 55 strategy. And the EU has pledged to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels well before 2030 under its REPowerEU plan.
The European Commission estimates that an average annual investment of €1.25 trillion during the period 2021-30 is required to meet the objectives of Fit for 55 and REPowerEU.[2]That estimate would add around two-thirds, or €500 billion, to the level of annual investment in climate and energy security seen during the previous decade.[3]
This is clearly a huge investment effort with an upfront cost that will need to be borne by our societies at a time when economic uncertainty is high. But analysis consistently shows that the benefits of a timely transition far outweigh the costs, especially when assessed against the alternative scenarios of doing nothing or doing too little too late. This has also been confirmed by a recent ECB stress test exercise and updated climate scenarios published by the global Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System last week.[4]
Half-time evaluation
So at half-time, where do we stand on the path to Paris? While many steps have been taken, we cannot yet conclude that we are on track for a timely transition scenario. Rather, it is becoming increasingly likely that we will see an intermediate scenario with increased transition risks and physical risks from extreme weather events and nature degradation.
And finance is lagging behind, too. Let me give some examples to illustrate the fact that the financial system has not yet sufficiently adapted to account for the ongoing climate and environmental crises.
First, capital markets are not playing their potential role in supporting the green transition. ECB research shows that stock markets can strongly encourage investment in greener technologies.[5]However, those markets are still relatively underdeveloped in the EU and cross-border flows are limited by a lack of harmonisation. Resolving these issues and advancing the capital markets union, as proposed by the European Commission, will make the flow of finance in Europe more efficient and more resilient. And it will satisfy investor demand for green assets. Research consistently points to the existence of a “greenium” in financial markets – in other words, a premium in terms of return on assets that investors are willing to forgo on assets certified as green.[6]
For private finance to be able to effectively support the green transition of the real economy, it is crucial that regulatory and legislative changes are consistent across sectors. In other words, in the absence of clear reasons to the contrary, which I fail to see, financial undertakings should not be treated differently from other companies, including in the context of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) that is currently being discussed by co-legislators. At the ECB, we consider that this can help to ensure that financial institutions – including banks – systematically integrate sustainability matters into their decision making and risk management practices. Not excluding the financial sector from the remit of the CSDDD can further help to create greater certainty around financial institutions’ obligations in this area and around climate- and environment-related litigation risks for the financial sector.[7]
While most of the financing for the green transition should come from private resources, the public sector also has an important role to play – both directly through public investment and indirectly though co-financing, private-public partnerships or State guarantees.[8]Much of this will be financed through EU Member States’ national recovery and resilience plans as part of the Next Generation EU programme that was set up to support the recovery from the pandemic. However, how much this EU-financed expenditure will contribute to the EU’s climate objectives is uncertain and depends on how quickly and successfully the individual countries implement their recovery and resilience plans. Some concerns related to administrative hurdles at the national and local levels have emerged in the context of Member States’ capacity to implement these plans.[9]
Besides financing gaps that curtail the transition, there are also gaps in the financial system that are threatening its resilience to increased climate-related and environmental damages. A discussion paper by the ECB and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority published earlier this year shows that only around 25% of all climate-related catastrophe losses in the EU are currently insured.[10]The lack of climate catastrophe insurance can affect the economy and financial stability. If losses are not covered by insurance, households and firms will take more time to resume their activities, slowing economic activity. This would increase overall risks to the financial system. What’s more, the fiscal position of governments may be also weakened if they need to provide relief to cover uninsured losses.
The banks at half-time
When we take a closer look at how the banks we supervise are faring in their journey, a similar picture emerges. On the one hand, the banks have made significant progress in starting to account for climate-related and environmental, or C&E risks. On the other hand, they are still far from being fully equipped to effectively deal with the challenges posed by a world that is increasingly exposed to the risks of the ongoing climate and environmental crises.
At the ECB we have consistently taken C&E risks into account in our supervision since we published a guide setting out our supervisory expectations for banks’ risk management practices in 2020.[11]Since then, we have carried out several supervisory exercises to assess banks’ approaches to managing these risks against our supervisory expectations. Although we have seen a number of good practices, at present none of the banks under our supervision fully meet all our expectations.
Following our assessments, we have repeatedly urged banks to ensure the sound management of climate-related and environmental risks, using the ECB expectations as a starting point. In other words, we expect banks to manage C&E risks just like any other material risk they are exposed to. Considering the clear requirements set out in the Capital Requirements Directive and the need for banks to implement a regular process for identifying all material risks, banks must ensure that their practices are fully aligned with the sound management of C&E risks. They must do so by the deadline of the end of 2024 at the latest, and we have also set interim deadlines by which banks need to satisfy certain requirements related to the management of these risks. These deadlines, as well as any other specific requirements, were informed by what the banks themselves considered reasonable when we first started discussing C&E risk management with them.
However, we have seen that a number of banks have not delivered within our March 2023 interim deadline. This means, for example, that three years after we published our guide, these banks have not yet performed an adequate materiality assessment of the impact of C&E risks across their portfolios, which is the basic starting point for managing any type of risk.
Therefore, it should come as no surprise that, in line with what we have communicated many times in the past, we have started to adopt enforcement measures. We have issued binding supervisory decisions, including the potential imposition of periodic penalty payments if banks fail on their requirements. In other words, we have told those banks to remedy the shortcoming by a certain date and, if they don’t comply, they will have to pay a penalty for every day the shortcoming remains unresolved.
Let me be clear: as the supervisor, it is not for the ECB to tell banks who they should or should not lend to. Instead, what we and other banking supervisors around the world have consistently been emphasising is that failing to adequately manage C&E risks is no longer compatible with sound risk management. Such a failure also increasingly calls into question the fitness and propriety of those in charge of establishing and steering banks’ practices. To manage their own risks, banks need to engage with their customers to gain a deep understanding of how they are being affected by the climate and environmental crises and how they will mitigate and adapt to the consequences. By failing to complete a proper materiality assessment, these banks are continuing to turn a blind eye to potential risks on their balance sheet. Risks that – based on what we have seen time and again in the assessments of those banks that have met the first interim deadline – prove to be material, both for individual banks and for the financial system as a whole.
This is a situation that we cannot and will not accept as we enter the second half of our marathon. In other words, banks also need to step up their efforts and achieve a negative split.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The halfway point is not just a moment for assessment, it’s also the time to make adjustments. The objective is clear, as is the route to the finish line. No adjustments are needed there. It is our pace as we head towards the finish line that needs to be seriously stepped up.
Whether it’s Kelvin Kiptum with another incredible negative split, or Eliud Kipchoge, or another athlete with an even-pacing strategy, we will witness an official sub-two hour marathon being run in the next few years. But whether we will be able to limit global heating to below the two degrees Celsius mark, let alone 1.5 degrees, which is increasingly out of reach, is much less certain. In fact, with the current policies implemented to reduce greenhouse gases, we are not on course to meet the Paris Agreement goals. This means that the threat of a disastrous scenario in which global heating will far surpass two degrees is very real. As a sobering reminder, global temperatures are currently set to rise by 3.2 degrees.[12]So what is required is action. Meaningful action. Urgent action. Meaningful, urgent and effective action that builds on the foundations that have been laid in recent years.
Let’s push for negative splits on all fronts needed and get finance fit for Paris.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 26th Frankfurt Euro Finance Week
Frankfurt, 13 November 2023
It is a pleasure to take part in this year’s edition of the Frankfurt Euro Finance Week. I will begin by providing an overview of the euro area economic outlook that underpinned the Governing Council’s deliberations and the monetary policy decisions we took in October. I will then discuss how we see the risks to financial stability and related macroprudential policy issues.
Euro area economic outlook
When I spoke at this event last year, inflation was at historically high levels, both in the euro area and around the world, and growth was slowing following the post-pandemic rebound. Today, inflation is significantly lower, but it is still expected to stay too high for too long. At the same time, the growth outlook for the euro area economy has deteriorated further, as global growth momentum slows and tighter financing conditions are increasingly weighing on investment and consumer spending.
In the third quarter of this year real GDP declined by 0.1% quarter on quarter. There are signs that manufacturing output remains firmly in contractionary territory, while the services sector has weakened further. Weaker industrial activity is spilling over to services, the impetus from reopening effects is fading and the impact of higher interest rates is broadening. It is likely that the euro area economy will remain subdued in the near term. However, it looks set to strengthen again over the medium term, as inflation falls further, household real incomes recover and the demand for euro area exports picks up.
Inflation, which has been on a downward trajectory over the last 12 months, dropped markedly in both September and October. It now stands at 2.9%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. The decline, which was in part due to strong base effects, was broad-based, reflecting a drop in energy prices and falling food, goods and services inflation. We expect a temporary rebound in inflation in the coming months as the base effects from the sharp increase in energy and food prices in autumn 2022 drop out of the year on year calculation. But we see the general disinflationary process continuing over the medium term. Energy prices remain a major source of uncertainty amid heightened geopolitical tensions and the impact of fiscal measures. The same is true for food prices, which may also come under upward pressure owing to adverse weather events and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly.
Most measures of underlying inflation continue to decline. The Eurostat’s flash estimate for inflation excluding energy and food points to a further decline to 4.2 % in October, supported by improving supply conditions, the pass-through of previous declines in energy prices, as well as the impact of tighter monetary policy on demand and corporate pricing power. At the same time, domestic price pressures are still strong and are being increasingly driven by wage pressures and the evolution of profit margins. While most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stand around 2 %, some indicators remain elevated and need to be monitored closely.
The resilience of the labour market has been a bright spot for the euro area economy, but there are signs that the labour market is beginning to weaken. Fewer new jobs are being created and, according to the latest flash estimate, employment expectations have continued to decline in October for both services and manufacturing.
Monetary policy
Based on our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, the Governing Council decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged at its October meeting.
The incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Our past interest rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully into financial and monetary conditions. Banks’ funding costs have continued to rise and are being passed on to businesses and households. The combination of higher borrowing rates and weakening activity led to a further sharp drop in credit demand in the third quarter of this year. And credit standards have tightened again. We are also seeing increasing signs of the impact of our policy decisions on the real economy. Further tightening is still in the pipeline from the current policy stance, and it is set to further dampen demand and help push down inflation.
We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are atlevels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.
Financial stability
Let me now turn to financial stability. In our upcoming Financial Stability Review, we highlight that the financial stability outlook remains fragile as the gradual effects of tighter financial conditions on both the financial and non-financial sectors take hold. These concerns are heightened by the recent upward shift in bond yields owing to the global “higher-for-longer” narrative and the flare-up of tensions in the Middle East, which have added to the uncertainty surrounding the outlook.
After a period of lower market volatility until August, the rising prospect of higher-for-longer rates has started to weigh on riskier asset valuations in recent months. Risk sentiment in markets remains highly sensitive to further surprises in inflation and economic growth. Higher than expected inflation or lower growth could trigger a rise in market volatility and risk premia, increasing the likelihood of credit events materialising.
This brings me to the vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector. As regards credit risk, some non-banks remain heavily exposed to interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as highly indebted corporates and real estate. Deteriorating corporate fundamentals and the ongoing correction in real estate markets could expose non-banks that have invested in these sectors to revaluation losses and investor outflows. Furthermore, low levels of liquidity could expose investment funds to the potential risk of forced asset sales if macro-financial outcomes deteriorate.
Corporate profitability in the euro area has held up well, but higher interest rates are weighing on the debt servicing capacity of more vulnerable firms. A weakening economy could prove challenging for firms with high debt levels, subdued earnings and low interest coverage ratios. Real estate firms are particularly vulnerable to losses stemming from the ongoing downturn in euro area commercial real estate markets. In an environment of tighter financing conditions and elevated uncertainty, real estate prices have declined markedly. The effects of higher interest rates have been compounded by structurally lower demand for some real estate assets following the pandemic. Although banks’ exposure to these markets is comparatively low, losses in this segment could act as an amplifying factor in the event of a wider shock. Euro area households, especially those with lower incomes and in countries with mainly floating-rate mortgages, are being increasingly squeezed by the higher interest rates. Tighter financing conditions have reduced the demand for housing, putting downward pressure on prices. On a more positive note, robust labour markets have so far supported household balance sheets, thereby mitigating the credit risk to banks.
Spreads in government bond markets have remained contained as many governments managed to secure cheap financing at longer maturities during the period of low interest rates. However, higher funding costs and less prudent fiscal policies could reignite concerns around sovereign debt sustainability, particularly in countries where debt levels are already high.
The euro area banking system has been a source of resilience in this turbulent year. Banks’ capital and liquidity buffers remain strong, and profitability has further improved in recent quarters on the back of higher interest rates. Despite these strong fundamentals, it is striking just how compressed bank valuations remain. This seems to reflect lingering concerns about the long-term sustainability of bank earnings, as they face increased downside risks from the prospect of deteriorating asset quality, lower lending volumes and higher funding costs. While asset quality indicators have been robust over the last year, early signs of deterioration are becoming visible – particularly in smaller firms and some sectors like commercial real estate.
Conclusion
Since the start of our hiking cycle, we have increased our policy rates by a cumulative 450 basis points. Our restrictive policy stance continues to be transmitted forcefully into financing conditions and is increasingly affecting the real economy. Inflation has come down markedly but is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remain strong. We will therefore ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.
In view of the prevailing elevated uncertainty, our future decisions on policy rates will continue to be data dependent and taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis. At our December meeting, we will have a new set of macroeconomic projections and more data on actual and underlying inflation, economic activity and the state of transmission, so we will be in a better position to reassess the inflation outlook and required policy action.
A resilient and well-functioning financial system is essential for the smooth transmission of monetary policy that is required to achieve our goal. To this end, macroprudential authorities should preserve releasable capital buffers to ensure that they are available in the event that conditions in the banking sector deteriorate. Furthermore, the lessons learnt from the turmoil this spring underline the need to implement outstanding Basel III reforms and complete the banking union, while previous market shocks confirm the need to boost the resilience of the non-bank financial sector by strengthening the policy framework for non-banks in an internationally coordinated manner.
Prudent and investment-oriented fiscal policies are also very supportive of our price stability goal. Fiscal policy should be geared towards making the euro area economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Structural reforms to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. It is therefore vital that the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework is concluded, in order to anchor expectations and support fiscal discipline."

Welcome address by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB Conference on Money Markets
Frankfurt am Main, 9 November 2023
Introduction
My aim in these opening remarks is to explore the macroeconomics of central bank liquidity. In particular, my focus is on how central bank reserves can influence macroeconomic outcomes. In turn, if central bank reserves are relevant for the level and volatility of economic activity and inflation, the calculation of the appropriate level of central bank liquidity should take into account the (time-varying) macroeconomic impact.[1]
The macroeconomic analysis of central bank reserves is necessarily subject to high uncertainty, since it is challenging to control for various confounding factors in conducting empirical analysis. In particular, the creation of central bank reserves on the liability side of the central bank balance sheet is typically matched by an increase in collateralised loans (refinancing operations) to banks or an increase in asset purchases on the asset side.[2]Refinancing operations (including targeted versions that require banks to meet a credit growth or credit composition target to benefit from favourable funding conditions) and asset purchases have direct macroeconomic effects that have been much studied, while the macroeconomic impact of the liability side of these interventions has received comparatively less attention.[3]
Over the last decade, much of the expansion in central bank reserves in the euro area has been a by-product of quantitative easing (large-scale asset purchases) or targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). These policies were motivated by their direct impact on bond markets and credit dynamics. In line with the ECB’s 2021 monetary policy strategy statement, from a stance perspective, the activation of such policies is only relevant in the neighbourhood of the effective lower bound (ELB) on policy rates.[4]Away from the ELB, by contrast, the short-term policy rate is the primary instrument to steer the monetary policy stance.
Central bank reserves in the euro area have also been created in the context of managing financial stress episodes. These include the surge in the take-up of refinancing operations during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the launch of the three-year very long-term refinancing operations (VLTROs) in 2011 and 2012. In terms of bond market stabilisation, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) purchased bonds of stressed countries between May 2010 and February 2012.[5]Initiated in March 2020, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) was a hybrid of a market-stabilisation programme and a quantitative-easing programme. The ECB’s monetary policy strategy statement recognised that financial stability is a precondition for price stability and that the pervasive role of macro-financial linkages in economic, monetary and financial developments requires that monetary policy decisions, including the evaluation of the proportionality of these decisions and potential side effects, are based on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. Accordingly, their roles in preserving and restoring financial stability are central in understanding the macroeconomic impact of central bank reserves.
In addition to the role of central bank reserves under non-standard conditions (whether proximity to the ELB and/or stressed circumstances), it is also important to assess the possible macroeconomic impact of the structural level of central bank reserves in the new steady state that will emerge after the roll back of QE-inspired asset purchase programmes and the expiry of the TLTRO programme.[6]In particular, the appropriate level of central bank reserves can be expected to remain much higher and be more volatile in this new steady state compared to the relatively-low levels that prevailed before the global financial crisis (GFC). Amongst other factors, the extraordinary macro-financial risk episodes (the GFC, the euro area sovereign debt crisis, the pandemic) in the last 15 years have underlined the importance of financial institutions maintaining significant liquidity levels.[7]For banks, central bank reserves are the ultimate liquid and risk-free (including zero valuation risk, zero counterparty credit risk and zero operational risk) asset. In turn, the liquidity options available to non-bank financial institutions (which do not have access to ECB liquidity facilities) depend on the liquidity conditions in the banking system.[8]
Central bank reserves: some stylised facts
To set the scene, Charts 1 and 2 show the role of central bank reserves in the balance sheet of the euro area banking system. Chart 1 plots the ratio of central bank reserves to total banking assets, while Chart 2 plots the ratios to some asset categories: loans, bond holdings and the stock of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA). We see that all of these metrics increased substantially when the ECB implemented its quantitative easing and targeted lending programmes but have eased noticeably from their peaks over the last year (the stock of central bank reserves peaked at EUR 4.92 trillions in November 2022).
Turning to the balance sheet of the Eurosystem, Charts 3-5 show the evolution of liabilities and assets. On the liability side, Chart 3 shows the relative contributions of central bank reserves, banknotes and other liabilities to the evolution of the balance sheet.On the asset side, Chart 4 shows the relative importance of the monetary policy outright portfolio of bond holdings and credit operations, as well as non-monetary policy assets on the Eurosystem balance sheet, including assets held for investment purposes. In turn, Chart 5 shows the mix of credit operations across three categories: one-week operations (I will label these as short-term refinancing operations – STROs – which are primarily provided through the main refinancing operations (MROs) in the euro area); the sum of 30-day and 90-day operations (I will label these as medium-term refinancing operations – MTROs); and operations with at least one year in duration (I will label these as longer-term refinancing operations – LTROs).[9]
Taken together, Charts 3-5 show that the amount of central bank reserves in the banking system has expanded substantially. In the first decade of the euro, the ECB had only created reserves to satisfy the liquidity needs resulting from the demand for banknotes and other so-called autonomous liquidity factors.[10]In the wake of the GFC, the deployment of some credit operations longer than one year and limited asset purchases during 2008-2013 led to a moderate expansion in reserves. A more substantial increase in central bank liquidity occurred from 2015 onwards, reflecting the large-scale implementation of quantitative easing and targeted lending programmes.
Finally, Chart 6 illustrates the footprint of the Eurosystem in the bond market by scaling asset purchases to the eligible bond universe. The asset purchases under the SMP, the asset purchase programme (APP) and the PEPP resulted in a sizeable presence in the bond market, which is now beginning to reverse due to a combination of the end of APP reinvestments and the ongoing expansion of the bond universe, especially due to issuance by governments.
Central bank reserves: the expansion phase and transitional dynamics
This section will first review the macroeconomic impact of the sustained expansion of central bank reserves over 2015-2022. The stock of central bank reserves has been shrinking since autumn 2022 and, under a wide range of scenarios, is set to continue to shrink over the next few years. In turn, this transition from peak central bank reserves to the “new normal” steady state also has macroeconomic implications. The initial experience with the decline in central bank reserves over the last year provides some preliminary lessons in relation to this transitional phase.
As I set out in the introduction, it is difficult to identify separately the role of central bank reserves and the impact of asset-side monetary policy measures (quantitative easing, targeted lending). However, it is plausible that the expansion in central bank reserves has reinforced the impact of quantitative easing (QE) and targeted lending incentives in easing monetary conditions. In relation to bond purchases, the portfolio rebalancing incentives faced by banks in adjusting to higher reserve holdings also increases bank demand for bonds.[11]In relation to credit creation, increased holdings of central bank reserves on a durable basis provided banks with increased comfort in their liquidity positions and provided incentives to increase their lending rather than sitting on an excessive amount of cash at the negative short-term interest rates that prevailed during the period 2014-2022.[12]
The shift in the monetary policy stance that started in December 2021 has provided further evidence on the role played by central bank reserves in determining macroeconomic outcomes.In particular, the reduction in central bank reserves from the repayment of TLTRO funds and the end of APP reinvestments has plausibly contributed to the increase in term premia (Chart 7) and the marked turnaround in credit dynamics to firms and households (Charts 8 and 9).[13]In the coming years, the ongoing reduction in the footprint of the ECB in the bond market and the repayment of TLTRO funds can be expected to continue to put upward pressure on term premia and contribute to lower credit creation. In turn, these contractionary forces lower the projected paths for GDP and inflation and thereby reduce the level of the policy rate required to stabilise inflation at the medium-term target (compared to a counterfactual in which monetary policy tightening was not accompanied by balance sheet reduction). Of course, the total impact of the decline in central bank reserves depends on the end point of this adjustment process, which depends on the future steady-state level of central bank reserves. This is the focus of the next section.
Central bank reserves in the steady state
This section will discuss the appropriate steady-state level of central bank reserves and the trade-offs across the different methods of providing liquidity. It is stipulated that the central bank sets the policy rate to deliver its medium-term inflation target in the steady state, so that there is no need to turn to additional instruments (such as QE or targeted refinancing operations) in the steady state. In addition, it is stipulated that the steady state is characterised by calm financial conditions. At the same time, the steady state configuration should take into account that the system can be hit by shocks and may subsequently be driven away from the steady state.
All else equal, the appropriate steady-state level of central bank reserves should be increasing in: the size of the banking system;the size of the overall financial system; and the overall size of the economy; the likelihood and potential severity of macro-financial tail events; the scarcity of safe assets; the effectiveness of micro-prudential and macro-prudential regulations (in combination with supervisory oversight) in curbing the incentives of banks to engage in excessive balance sheet expansion and maturity transformation; the mobility of deposits; and the policy prioritisation attached to minimising the risk of hitting the ELB.[14]While this list is non-exhaustive, in working through it, each of these dimensions clearly also depends on the balance of the asset-side interventions (between refinancing operations and bond purchases) that are the counterparts to the issuance of central bank reserves.[15]
Taking each of these dimensions in turn, the level of central bank reserves should scale up with trend growth in the size of the banking system and the size of the financial system: the liquidity preference of investors is likely proportional to the scale of overall asset holdings. In related fashion, all else equal, autonomous factors such as the desired holdings of banknotes should also trend upwards in line with overall income levels.[16]In relation to the banking system, the composition of the assets held by a bank matters, as does the overall scale of the balance sheet. In particular, a bank may desire to hold central bank reserves in proportion to the scale of its loan portfolio and its holding of other illiquid assets, since loans and illiquid assets cannot be costlessly sold in the event of deposit outflows.[17]
In a system in which the central bank only provides liquidity to banks, the liquidity needs of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) can have spillover implications for the banking system.
First, NBFIs hold liquidity in the forms of considerable uninsured deposits with banks, together with an array of highly-liquid market instruments. In particular, if there is a surge in the liquidity needs of NBFIs, due to redemption outflows from investors or rising margin calls on leveraged positions, this would also intensify liquidity pressures on the banking system through a range of mechanisms.
Next, the prevalence and severity of macro-financial risk increase the prudent level of central bank reserves. Whereas the long “great moderation” period before the GFC led many to believe that systemic risks had structurally declined, the sequence of the GFC, the euro area sovereign debt crisis and the pandemic has powerfully demonstrated that macro-financial risk events can occur and trigger substantial liquidity demands. Moreover, there is an intrinsic amplification of macro-financial risks in a monetary union that lacks sufficient area-wide common safe assets and a full banking union, since investors can try to escape country-specific risks without taking on currency risk by running to safer jurisdictions within the monetary union. In turn, in view of the scope for self-fulfilling crisis episodes, the likelihood of macro-financial risk events is intrinsically higher in such a monetary union compared to a complete monetary union.[18]
Insurance against the liquidity impact of systemic macro-financial risks can also be provided by a central bank commitment to provide liquidity promptly and elastically during crisis episodes, rather than solely through the precautionary self-insurance of holding a high stock of central bank reserves. It follows that the appropriate ex-ante level of central bank reserves is lower if a central bank has a proven reputation for the agile expansion of liquidity facilities if stressed conditions emerge.
If safe assets are scarce in the financial system, this can reinforce the value of a higher steady-state level of central bank reserves if this can deliver a net increase in the stock of safe assets.[19]First, all else equal, the safe asset characteristics of central bank reserves alleviates this scarcity. Second, the asset-side interventions by central banks to create reserves are less costly if central banks do not exacerbate safe asset scarcity by exclusively purchasing the highest-rated (or shortest-dated) securities in a structural bond portfolio. In particular, within limits, some combination of a broad-based structured bond portfolio and short-term and longer-term refinancing operations against a broad collateral pool can generate an expansion in the pool of safe assets, without excessively crowding out other purchasers of the highest-quality bonds.
As shown in the previous section a high stock of central bank reserves may support credit creation, at least if banks are confident that these will remain available for a significant period, rather than requiring frequent rollover.[20]If there are frictions in credit intermediation, this boost to credit creation might be welcomed as bringing the economy closer to the social optimum. In contrast, if the banking system is characterised by distorted incentives to over-lend and take excessive risks, the boost to credit creation could rather be viewed as a negative and would call for a lower stock of central bank reserves. It follows that the regulatory and supervisory environment is a pivotal factor in determining the prudent level of central bank reserves. In particular, a regulatory system (backed up by effective supervision) that curbs over-lending and distorted incentives to take excessive risks would mitigate concerns that a high level of central bank reserves might overly stimulate credit creation. This spans micro-prudential regulations (including capital requirements and leverage requirements), macro-prudential regulations (including borrower-based measures and counter-cyclical and systemic risk buffers) and close supervisory monitoring of the risk management practices in the banking system.[21]
In related manner, a high stock of central bank reserves can act to lower term premia in bond markets for two reasons. First, if central bank reserves are created via bond purchases by the central bank, this directly lowers term premia by extracting duration risk and credit risk.[22]Second, even if created via refinancing operations, banks may boost their bond holdings as a balanced portfolio response to higher reserves.[23]To the extent that market frictions (including, in an incomplete monetary union, the risk of self-fulfilling, unwarranted market fragmentation events) excessively depress bond market participation, the curbing of excessive term premia might be viewed as a positive feature by underpinning financial stability.
In the other direction, if term premia are excessively compressed, this generates undesirable financial stability risks through search-for-yield-behaviour and asset mispricing.[24]Comprehensive financial regulation and supervision (of both banks and non-bank financial institutions) can mitigate such risks to some extent. Further possible mitigants include: the omission of the longest maturities from the steady-state structural bond portfolio of the central bank; the prioritisation of supranational bonds over national bonds; and the inclusion of private sector bonds in addition to sovereign bonds. In any event, the calibration of the appropriate steady-state level of central bank reserves must balance the competing pro-stability and anti-stability effects on the financial system of a high stock of central bank reserves.
Limiting the excessive compression of term premia also calls a sufficient role for refinancing operations in the creation of central bank reserves, rather than building an excessively-large structural bond portfolio. In addition, refinancing operations also promise to have a more even distribution of reserves across individual banks, since the proceeds of asset purchases tend to be deposited (and remain pooled) in a relatively small number of “money centre” banks, whereas all banks have access to refinancing operations (subject to collateral availability).[25]From a macroeconomic perspective, the attractiveness of using both a structural portfolio and refinancing operations to generate reserves is that this is more efficient in getting liquidity into all the cracks (across different types of banks and across jurisdictions), which is plausibly not the case if reserves are only created through a structural bond portfolio and there are frictions to the mobility of reserves. Cross-border frictions are a particular concern in a limited monetary union (that lacks a complete banking union and capital markets union). Of course, frictions across different types of bank business models are also present even in fully-integrated financial systems.
In turn, there are distinct possible roles for short-term (one-week) refinancing operations and longer-term (say, one year or longer) refinancing operations. Short-term refinancing operations have traditionally been a standard, flexible tool to manage fluctuations in the liquidity needs of banks. However, an over-reliance on short-term refinancing poses operational risk challenges, while investors and regulators may prefer banks to have a healthy proportion of longer-term refinancing in the overall liquidity profile. Moreover, from a macroeconomic perspective, seven-day funding does not necessarily provide sufficiently-durable liquidity to support longer-term commitments such as bank loans or the acquisition of illiquid assets. Furthermore, in principle, structural longer-term refinancing operations could remedy some specific credit intermediation frictions such as the possible under-funding of investment projects to underpin the green transition that typically demand stable funding over a longer horizon.[26]
Another factor calling for more reserve holdings is the extent to which deposits are mobile. Along one dimension, the sectoral composition of deposits matters: deposits from households and firms are stickier than deposits from non-bank financial institutions. In terms of the geographical dimension, in an incomplete monetary union, there is a high potential degree of cross-border deposit mobility under stressed conditions. Such geographical flight-to-safety deposit dynamics can be amplified if there is excessive reliance on refinancing operations as a source of liquidity, since the value of the local collateral available would fall under stressed conditions, giving rise to liquidity spiral dynamics by which lower liquidity interacts with falling asset values.
Finally, the appropriate steady-state level of central bank reserves depends on the policy prioritisation accorded to avoiding the effective lower bound on the policy rate. To the extent that a larger stock of central bank reserves supports more credit creation and lower term premia, the equilibrium policy rate will have to be higher (and further away from the ELB) in order to deliver the inflation target. This preserves policy space, since the extra distance to the ELB would in turn facilitate the deployment of rate cuts in the event of dis-inflationary shocks. However, this concern is less important if it is understood that the central bank would not hesitate to roll out quantitative easing and targeted lending programmes if the ELB constrained policy rate cuts.[27]
Conclusion
Let me draw some conclusions on the macroeconomics of central bank reserves. First, even if much lower than the current level, the appropriate level of central bank reserves in the “new normal” steady state should avoid the risks associated with excessively-scarce or excessively-abundant reserves. Such a middle path would strike an appropriate balance between the benefits and costs associated with the creation of central bank reserves and also seems best suited to safeguard the stability of the banking and financial systems.
In particular, a durable level of central bank reserves is likely required to ensure the sufficient provision of bank credit to enable the euro area economy to attain its steady-state potential output growth rate, in view of the importance of central bank reserves in underpinning the willingness of banks to extend credit in spite of the risks associated with illiquid assets (such as bank loans) in a world much more prone to macro-financial shocks. This steady-state level of central bank reserves likely has a positive trend component, in view of the connection between the optimal level of central bank reserves and the overall size of the financial system.
Second, in view of the trade-offs posed by each individual instrument, it seems proportionate from a macroeconomic perspective for a central bank to use a range of instruments to provide central bank reserves. Central bank reserves can be provided both through a structural bond portfolio on the one side, and a structural longer-term refinancing operation as well as a standard short-term refinancing operation on the other side. A mix of a structural bond portfolio and longer-term refinancing operations would provide longer-time liquidity to the banking system, while the short-term refinancing operations are well suited to the absorption of higher-frequency liquidity shocks. In turn, the relative contributions of each of these instruments can and should vary in response to various macro-financial shocks.
Third, the supply of central bank reserves should be elastic in the event of macro-financial stress. If it is understood that the supply will be sufficiently elastic under stressed conditions, this should reduce the precautionary demand for reserves in the steady state, since there is no need to excessively self-insure if reserves are reliably available under stressed conditions.
Fourth, it should be recognised that sustained surges in central bank reserves may also occur in the future if the configuration of shocks means that policy rates return to the neighbourhood of the ELB and there is a renewed need for quantitative easing and/or credit-easing longer-term refinancing operations to preserve price stability."

Keynote speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture
St. Louis, 2 November 2023
In long-distance running, the last mile is often said to be the hardest. With the finish line within reach, one must push even harder to achieve the long-held goal.
The same could be said about tackling the last mile of disinflation.
Over the past twelve months we have seen the first phase of disinflation. Headline inflation fell rapidly and measurably, as previous supply-side shocks reversed. Dislocations in global supply chains were gradually resolved, and energy and food prices came off their peaks reached after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These were the quick wins of the disinflation process.
In my remarks today I would like to discuss why bringing inflation from here back to 2% in a timely manner may be more difficult. I will argue that, unlike during the first phase, disinflation during the last mile hinges critically on the appropriate calibration and effective transmission of monetary policy. Large uncertainty around these two factors, together with the risk of new supply-side shocks pulling inflation away from our target once again, makes this part of the disinflation process the most difficult.
Monetary policy needs to respond to these challenges with perseverance and vigilance.
The last mile marks a change in the disinflation process
Headline inflation in the euro area declined rapidly to 2.9% in October from its peak of 10.6% one year earlier. The bulk of this large drop reflects the substantial decline in the contributions from energy and food inflation (Slide 2, left-hand side).
To a large extent, these effects were to be expected, also in their magnitude. They arise from the statistical observation that, after a large price shock, inflation usually slows measurably once the unusually large monthly price increases of the previous year start to drop out of annual inflation rates.
These mechanical dynamics are known as base effects. Oil and gas prices, in particular, have come down remarkably fast from the highs observed in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (Slide 2, right-hand side). Today, oil and gas prices are trading close to, or below, pre-invasion levels.
Such outright price declines are rare. They are usually limited to highly volatile prices of commodities that are traded in international markets and for which the pass-through to final consumer prices is typically large and, in many cases, imminent, running directly through the energy component of the Harmonised Consumer Price Index (HICP).[1]
Following large commodity shocks, an initial rapid decline in headline inflation is therefore the norm rather than the exception. This was also the case after the global financial crisis in 2008 and the financial turmoil in 2012.[2]
A recent IMF study shows that such strong initial base effects have often given rise to “premature celebrations”.[3]That is, when inflation starts falling, it is tempting to conclude that it has been fought off successfully and that it is a matter of when, and not if, inflation will fall back to target.
However, in about 90% of unresolved inflation episodes, inflation declined materially within the first three years after the initial shock, but then either plateaued at an elevated level or accelerated again.
Base effects themselves may be one reason why this can happen. By definition, they have a finite horizon. They often turn from being a source of disinflation to becoming a renewed headwind, as they operate in both directions. They swing like a pendulum, meaning that disinflation is not necessarily a smooth process but can be a rather bumpy road.
This also applies today.Our estimates suggest that, should energy prices over the coming months increase in line with their historical mean, energy is estimated to add nearly 1.9 percentage points to euro area headline inflation by July 2024 (Slide 3, left-hand side). This primarily reflects the strong decline in oil and gas prices observed since November 2022. A rise in energy prices over and above the historical mean would further amplify such base effects.
The extraordinarily sharp rise in food prices in 2022 and early 2023 implies that similar dynamics for headline inflation may occur, at some point, for the food component of the HICP (Slide 3, right-hand side).
The other reason causing inflation persistence is that underlying price pressures can prove much stickier than volatile commodity prices.
Last year’s energy price shock quickly turned into a broad-based price level shock, as firms passed most of their cost increases on to final consumer prices. As a result, core inflation, which excludes the direct effects of energy and food, increased strongly in the euro area, reaching its peak of 5.8% in March 2023, significantly later than headline inflation. In October, it was still running at 4.2%.
The reversal of base effects implies that continued disinflation will need to rely on a steady decline in underlying inflation. The last mile is about this change in the disinflation process. It is no longer about mechanical price reversals but about creating the conditions required for the indirect and second-round effects of supply-side shocks not to become entrenched in underlying inflation. This is the task of monetary policy.
Price and wage rigidities mean underlying inflation is stickier
Our most recent ECB staff projections see both headline and core inflation declining towards 2% by the end of 2025 (Slide 4). The projections highlight a key characteristic of the last mile: while it took a year to bring inflation from 10.6% to 2.9%, it is expected to take about twice as long to get from here back to 2%.
In other words, the disinflation process is projected to slow significantly. Essentially, this has to do with the way wages and prices are set.[4]
Last year, firms revised their selling prices much more frequently than they usually do (Slide 5, left-hand side). They were doing this to protect their profit margins at a time of rapidly rising input costs. In the jargon of economists, this is referred to as state-dependent pricing: if prices are far away from their optimal level, firms are more likely to adjust them (Slide 5, right-hand side).[5]
In many cases, firms even raised their selling prices beyond the increase in costs, bolstering unit profits (Slide 6, left-hand side). This was possible because aggregate demand remained exceptionally resilient at a time of significant supply constraints, with fiscal transfers shielding firms and households from the adverse income effects of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine (Slide 6, right-hand side).[6]
But when input costs are falling, or when conditions are broadly stable, most firms behave differently. They then revise their prices more reluctantly, which makes underlying inflation stickier and disinflation slower.
In addition, wages are often set in a staggered way, affecting firms’ cost base only with a lag.[7]In the euro area, wage growth has picked up sharply over the past year as employees are trying to make up for lost purchasing power.
Our indicators, especially those tracking recently signed wage agreements, point to continued strong wage growth at a time when inflation is already falling (Slide 7, left-hand side). These are the slow-moving second-round effects of the adverse supply-side shocks that hit the euro area economy in previous years.
Meagre productivity growth is putting additional pressure on firm’s unit labour costs, which have been rising sharply since the beginning of 2022 (Slide 7, right-hand side).
The distribution of price changes illustrates these rigidities. In September, around 45% of services prices, weighted according to their share in the HICP basket, were still increasing at a rate above 5%, with this share declining only very slowly (Slide 8, left-hand side). In the goods sector, the share of products seeing particularly strong price increases started to decline earlier (Slide 8, right-hand side). But even in this sector, still nearly 40% of products are currently rising at a rate above 5%.
Given these rigidities, disinflation will slow down appreciably. For core inflation to evolve in line with ECB staff projections, two key conditions need to be met. One is that the growth in unit labour costs eventually falls back to levels that are broadly consistent with 2% medium-term inflation. The second is that firms will use their profit margins as a buffer to limit the pass-through of the current strong wage increases to consumer prices.
The last mile is about ensuring that these two conditions materialise in a timely manner. That process faces two key challenges. The first is the appropriate calibration and transmission of monetary policy. The second is the potential occurrence of new supply-side shocks.
Disinflation during the last mile relies critically on monetary policy succeeding in reducing underlying inflation in a steady and timely manner.
During the first phase of disinflation, a determined policy response was mainly required to keep inflation expectations anchored, thereby reducing the macroeconomic costs associated with restoring price stability.[8]During the last mile, the demand channel of monetary policy – whereby tighter policy slows economic activity – becomes critical when the long and variable lags are gradually drawing to a close.
As such, monetary policy needs to steer wage- and price-setting in a way that ensures that the two conditions on unit labour costs and profit margins are met. This is particularly true in an environment in which the multi-year suspension of fiscal rules and the potential absence of a revised economic governance framework in the European Union risk leaving fiscal policy too expansionary for too long.
While economic growth in the euro area has been weak over the course of this year, considerable uncertainty about the lags and effects of monetary policy remains. A broad distinction can be drawn between the uncertainty around the appropriate calibration of monetary policy and the uncertainty regarding its transmission.
Calibration uncertainty relates to the choice of the appropriate level of the policy rates and the period over which they need to remain at this level. It is inherently difficult to estimate the degree of monetary tightening required to bring inflation back to 2% over a certain horizon.
This is especially relevant in the current context. There is considerable uncertainty about the impact of recent shocks on the supply capacity of the economy, and hence on the level of slack. For example, if recent shocks were to depress the level of potential output more persistently, the output gap could be smaller or even positive rather than negative as in the conventional estimates.
At the same time, digitalisation, rapid progress in artificial intelligence and ongoing efforts to accelerate the green transition could boost potential output growth. This is what financial markets seem to expect increasingly. Since early 2022, market-based estimates of the natural rate have increased measurably both in the euro area and in the United States (Slide 9, left-hand side).
Overall, therefore, there is large uncertainty about how structural changes will affect activity in the euro area and globally, making the calibration of monetary policy more difficult.
Transmission uncertainty can amplify calibration uncertainty – that is, even if policy is initially calibrated appropriately, it is unclear how fast and to what extent a given policy impulse is transmitted to activity, prices and wages (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]The pace and strength of transmission affect the optimal level and duration of policy.
The transmission of our past policy actions to bank lending conditions has been strong, with the cost of borrowing rising sharply (Slide 10, left-hand side). As a result, net credit flows have virtually come to a standstill, for both firms and households (Slide 10, right-hand side). With interest rates on time deposits rising, saving has also become more attractive, contributing to a rise in households’ savings ratio.
The transmission through capital markets has been more mixed.
Until recently, risk premia in most segments remained exceptionally compressed. In the past, risk premia in both equity and corporate bond markets rose when the euro area composite Purchasing Managers’ Index fell below the growth threshold of 50 (Slide 11). This has not been the case this year, however: although economic sentiment deteriorated measurably, the risk premium has held firm, making financial conditions easier than usual.
In sovereign bond markets, term premia – that is, the risk premia investors demand for bearing duration risk – have increased continuously and persistently since we started removing policy accommodation in December 2021 (Slide 12, left-hand side). The current and expected future run-off of all our asset purchase programmes has contributed to this development (Slide 12, right-hand side).
However, the unusually low level of the term premium in the United States is likely to have also held back a return to higher levels in the euro area through arbitrage conditions. The recent rise in global term premia has helped bring market-based financing conditions closer to those expected given the current level of the policy rates, although volatility remains large.
Significant uncertainty also remains about how broader policy transmission will be affected by two structural factors.
The first relates to the services sector.
Monetary policy works predominantly by affecting the cost of capital. It is therefore natural that it has a stronger impact on more capital-intensive activities, such as construction and manufacturing. However, over the past few decades the share of capital-intensive industries in total activity has declined steadily in the euro area and globally (Slide 13, left-hand side). Today, market services account for more than half of gross value added.
In our most recent corporate telephone survey, three out of four firms in the services sector reported that the substantial change in financing conditions over the past 12 months had no impact on their business activity (Slide 13, right-hand side). And an even larger share of services firms expect this to be the case over the coming 12 months.
Monetary policy transmission may therefore be weaker, or less direct, than in the past, which may lengthen the disinflation process.
The second source of uncertainty concerns the persistent shortages of workers.
Surveys continue to point to labour as a critical factor limiting production. Shortages remain near historic highs across sectors, especially in the services sector (Slide 14, left-hand side).
As a result, companies have responded to weakening economic activity by hanging on to their employees out of concern that they might be unable to find workers once demand picks up again. So, despite the strongest tightening in the history of the euro area, by 450 basis points in little more than a year, the unemployment rate fell to a new historic low in August, while the labour force continued to increase throughout the first half of this year (Slide 14, right-hand side).
It is unclear how long the transmission through the labour market will remain muted. It is reasonable to assume that the longer economic activity stagnates, the harder it will be for firms, most notably small and medium-sized firms, to hoard labour. And indeed, we are seeing first signs that the labour market is softening and demand for labour slowing.
But the more slowly this process unfolds and the weaker it is, the higher the risks that persistent labour market tightness will challenge the assumptions underlying the projected decline in core inflation.
In particular, unit labour costs may grow more strongly than projected as labour hoarding continues to weigh on productivity growth and labour shortages support favourable wage bargaining conditions at a time when workers are still trying to make up for the substantial losses in their purchasing power.
Higher unit labour costs, in turn, raise the risk that firms pass a larger part of their cost increases on to final consumer prices, which could lay the ground for a wage-price spiral.
New shocks could derail the disinflation process
This brings me to the second challenge facing monetary policymakers during the last mile: because disinflation will slow down appreciably, there is a high risk of a new shock pulling inflation away from our target once again before it has been reached and of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.
This is especially relevant in the current geopolitical environment.
The tragic events in the Middle East triggered by the terrorist attack on Israel are a case in point. Oil and gas price futures rose noticeably, adding to concerns over supply following the recent gas pipeline leak in the Baltic Sea. More generally, we have recently observed a rising sensitivity of energy prices to even remote risks, such as strikes at liquefied natural gas plants in Australia.
Such shocks can visibly disrupt the disinflation process. Compared with the end of June, oil prices are up by 25% in euro terms. Since then, the energy contribution to the inflation momentum, defined as the annualised three-month-on-three-month percentage change, has increased measurably (Slide 15, left-hand side). As a result, while in July the inflation momentum was consistent with annual inflation of 2%, in October it was 4.4%.
Other shocks are already on the horizon. This year’s El Niño is expected to bring months of extreme heat and rainfall to parts of the world, reinforcing the risks stemming from global warming. This is threatening to disrupt crop cycles and put further pressure on global food markets (Slide 15, right-hand side).
By delaying the return of inflation to 2%, such adverse supply-side shocks pose larger than usual risks to medium-term price stability, as they are more likely to trigger shifts in inflation expectations.[10]It is well known that people tend to pay little attention to inflation when it is low and stable. But the theory of rational inattention suggests that firms and households start paying attention when inflation is high, making price and wage setting more sensitive to new price shocks.[11]This is especially true if such shocks concern salient goods such as energy and food.
Private sector participants are factoring in these risks. Although our determined monetary policy decisions have secured the broad anchoring of long-term inflation expectations, surveys and financial market prices continue to point to concerns that inflation may stay elevated.
For example, the distribution of longer-term inflation expectations in our survey of professional forecasters, while remaining broadly anchored around our target, has shifted visibly to the right compared with the periods before and during the pandemic (Slide 16, left-hand side), with risks to the inflation outlook being tilted to the upside. Similarly, risk premia in the swap market for inflation far into the future remain elevated (Slide 16, right-hand side).
Implications for monetary policy
In the light of all of this, and with this I would like to conclude, disinflation really does seem like a long-distance race. When the runner enters the last mile, the hardest work begins. While the first phase of the race may have appeared easy, the last mile requires perseverance and vigilance. The same is true for our fight against inflation.
Perseverance is needed to avoid declaring victory too early. With our current monetary policy stance, we expect inflation to return to our target by 2025. The progress on inflation that we have seen so far is encouraging and in line with our projections. We therefore decided to leave our key policy rates unchanged at last week’s monetary policy meeting.
However, the disinflation process during the last mile will be more uncertain, slower and bumpier. Continued vigilance is therefore needed. After a long period of high inflation, inflation expectations are fragile and renewed supply-side shocks can destabilise them, threatening medium-term price stability. This also means that we cannot close the door to further rate hikes.
If we stay vigilant, we will be able to spot early on any risks to the inflation outlook that are materialising, just as the runner listens to the signals from her body. This means that we need to carefully monitor all incoming data and continuously verify whether they are consistent with the assumptions underlying our projections.
Data dependence ensures that our monetary policy is at all times calibrated in accordance with the circumstances we are facing. The inflation target is now within reach, but let’s celebrate only once we have truly tackled the last mile.
Thank you."

Remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB at the Business Leadership Forum organised by IE University
Madrid, 30 October 2023
Recent economic developments
The euro area economy remains weak.[1]Foreign demand is subdued and tighter financing conditions are increasingly weighing on investment and consumer spending. The services sector is also losing steam, with weaker industrial activity spilling over to other sectors, and the impact of higher interest rates is broadening. Recent indicators point to continued weakness in the near term.
The labour market has been a bright spot supporting the euro area economy and has, so far, remained resilient to the slowdown in growth. But there are signs that it is turning. While unemployment stood at 6.4% in August, the lowest level recorded since the start of the euro, fewer new jobs are being created, including in services, which suggests that the cooling of the economy is gradually feeding through to employment.
Moreover, the risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy transmission turn out stronger than expected, or if the world economy weakens further. Furthermore, major geopolitical risks have intensified and are clouding the outlook. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident and more uncertain about the future, and dampen growth further.
At the same time, while remaining significantly above our medium-term target of 2%, recent inflation data have been in line with our expectations, confirming that our monetary policy is working. Inflation dropped sharply to 4.3% in September and the fall was visible in all its major components. Food price inflation decreased again, but – at 8.8% – remains high by historical standards. Energy prices fell by 4.6%, but have risen again more recently, and have become less predictable in view of the new geopolitical tensions. Inflation excluding energy and food also dropped to 4.5% in September, and we see continued declines in measures of underlying inflation. However, domestic inflation remains strong owing to the growing importance of wage pressures.
The inflation outlook remains surrounded by significant uncertainty. In particular, heightened geopolitical tensions could drive up energy prices and higher than anticipated increases in wages could drive inflation higher. By contrast, a stronger transmission of monetary policy or a worsening of the global economic environment would ease price pressures.
Longer-term interest rates have risen markedly since mid-September, reflecting strong increases in other major economies. The transmission of our monetary policy into broader financing conditions remains forceful. Bank funding costs have continued to rise, as have lending rates for business loans and mortgages. Banks also reported a further sharp drop in credit demand in the third quarter of the year, while credit standards for loans to firms and households tightened again, which was reflected in visibly weakened credit dynamics.
The monetary policy stance
Against this background, we decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged, at our meeting last week. The incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Inflation is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remain strong. At the same time, inflation dropped markedly in September and most measures of underlying inflation have continued to ease. Past interest rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully into financing conditions, which is helping to push down inflation.
We consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. Our future decisions will ensure that policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. By the December meeting, we will have GDP growth data for the third quarter of the year, the inflation figures for October and November, and a new round of projections. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.
As the energy crisis fades, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures. This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for even tighter monetary policy. Fiscal policies should be designed to make the euro area economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt. Structural reforms and investments to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity – which would be supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme – can help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green and digital transitions. To that end, the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded before the end of this year and progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union should be accelerated."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the official dinner of the Bank of Greece in Athens, Greece
Athens, 25 October 2023
Before I start, I should mention that – as we are in our so-called “quiet period” – I will not be making any remarks on current or future monetary policy.
I would like to thank the Bank of Greece for hosting our dinner tonight. And thank you for the tremendous effort you have put into organising this external Governing Council meeting at your impressive headquarters here in Athens.
Standing in this hall, I am struck by the overwhelming sense of continuity with the past. So much of what we consider to be European civilisation has emerged from these surroundings.
This is the home of Pericles and the cradle of democracy. It gave us Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and the foundations of our philosophy. The ancient Greeks taught us mathematics via Euclid, science via Archimedes and poetry through Homer.
And this is not to mention the timeless contributions to theatre, art and architecture that Greek civilisation has bequeathed to us.
Over millennia, these different threads have been central to forming an idea of what it means to be European: one based on democracy, justice and reason. And without this idea, I find it hard to imagine that Europeans would have been able to share a single currency.
So, the very fact that we are here today owes much to the history of this place.
But what the brightest minds of this country have also taught us is that it is not only the destination that matters, but how we are changed by the journey to get there. As modern Greece’s most celebrated poet, Constantine Cavafy, wrote in his poem Ithaca:
“Keep Ithaca always in your mind.Arriving there is what you’re destined for.”
But by the time you reach the island, you will be “wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way”.
And this sentiment, I think, speaks to the story of Greece in recent times. The people of Greece have been on a long journey. It has been a hard journey. But they never lost sight of the destination. And much has been gained along the way.
As we all know, the crisis that erupted in 2009 – and the programme of fiscal adjustment and structural reforms it entailed – took an exceptionally heavy toll.
From 2008 to 2016, Greece’s GDP shrank by more than a quarter. The unemployment rate surged by 20 percentage points at its peak. And just as the economy was recovering and the reforms were bearing fruit, disaster struck again. The pandemic brought travel and tourism to a standstill, and Greece’s economy contracted by a further 9% in 2020.
Throughout this period, Greece has also been at the forefront of the global challenges facing Europe. The climate crisis has been ever-present, as was demonstrated tragically this summer. And Greece has also borne the brunt of the various migration crises that have hit Europe.
Yet, despite this succession of setbacks, the country’s resilience has been remarkable.
Thanks to the hard work that has been done to make the economy more flexible, Greece has made an impressive comeback from the pandemic.
Real GDP per capita is now almost 10% above its pre-pandemic level – a much stronger performance than the euro area as a whole. The unemployment rate has also declined steeply, and was 10.9% in August, the lowest level since the end of 2009.
And with a stronger economy, the country has been able to work further through its debt challenge. Greece’s public debt-to-GDP ratio has dropped 35 percentage points from its peak of 206% in 2020, one of the fastest falls in the world. Two rating agencies recently upgraded Greek government bonds to investment grade status.
But it is not only the economy that has been resilient – it is also the Greek people. There were times when they could have chosen a different path. Yet they have remained committed to being at the heart of Europe, even in the hardest of times.
In fact, Greek support for the common currency has risen 16 percentage points over the past decade, with more than three-quarters of the public now in favour. And Greece has seen a 19 percentage point surge in favourable views of the EU over that period.
This example can serve as an inspiration for all of us as we contend with a more volatile world and the many challenges it brings. It is an example of resilience in the face of great challenges. And it is an example of the importance of being part of something bigger – our shared European destiny.
As we stand here in the heart of Athens, we see the best of what Europe can be – a place steeped in the past, alive with its history, but also one imbued with cultural and economic vigour, and with its eyes set firmly on the future.
I think it would be hard to find a city, and indeed a country, more suited to being the de facto capital of the euro area for this week."

Dinner speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 5thECB macroprudential policy and research conference jointly organised with the International Monetary Fund
Frankfurt am Main, 17 October 2023
It is with great pleasure that we host the fifth ECB macroprudential policy and research conference, the first one to be held in person since the beginning of the pandemic.
This conference aims to preserve close ties between the research community, practitioners and policymakers in the macroprudential policy field which, especially in the euro area, is still relatively young.
From my point of view, the macro-financial challenges we are currently facing certainly provide a strong motivation to further strengthen the ties between research and policy.
Let me highlight some of the challenges that lie ahead from a macroprudential perspective and point to some areas where I believe research could support policy-making in the current environment.
Economic activity remains subdued and is expected to stagnate until year end with risks tilted to the downside. Inflation is declining but is expected to continue being clearly above our definition of price stability. Over the past 14 months, we have raised our policy rate at an unprecedented pace, by a cumulative 450 basis points, and significantly reduced the size of the ECB’s balance sheet, leading to tighter financing conditions.
In this context, the euro area financial stability outlook is fragile, as the financial system adapts to a higher interest rate environment. Real estate markets are in a downturn, a severe one for commercial real estate. So far, most firms and households have not endured material stress, although it will take some time before the full impact of higher borrowing costs, high inflation and weak growth is felt. On the positive side, bank capital positions in the euro area are sound and the results of the stress test carried out by the ECB in 2023 confirm that the euro area banking system could withstand a severe adverse scenario.
Experience tells us, however, that banks might be unwilling to use regulatory capital buffers to absorb losses, opting instead for de-leveraging to preserve capital ratios. This is because the use of regulatory buffers comes with limitations, for example, to dividend pay-outs. Here is where macroprudential policy comes to the fore. Certain macroprudential capital buffers can be released, making capital usable without limitations, which mitigates the risk of de-leveraging. Therefore, considering the challenging financial stability outlook, a pertinent question is whether this is the right time for macroprudential policy to release capital buffers.
In our view, this is not yet the time for thinking about macroprudential capital buffer releases. Despite the challenging macro-financial environment, banks are currently resilient and profitable: on average, their return on equity has reached double-digit figures for the first time since the global financial crisis. While bank lending lost momentum, there is currently no indication that this is due to banks being bound by capital constraints that should be alleviated by macroprudential policy. This type of constraints could emerge, for example, when banks expect broad based asset quality deterioration and losses. Therefore, in the current context, we expect that a release of macroprudential capital buffers would not have any beneficial effect on lending. To the contrary, maintaining existing buffers preserves resilience and trust in the banking system when risks are looming. It also has beneficial effects on funding costs, and it incentivises prudent distributions from banks.
Having established that macroprudential buffers should be preserved, the next question is whether current macroprudential resilience in the banking system is sufficient if turbulence turns into a storm. Macroprudential policy in the banking union currently provides a comfortable first line of defence against systemic risk. 13 countries now have positive rates for the Counter Cyclical Capital Buffer or CCyB, the key macroprudential buffer explicitly designed for release during periods of distress. The size of the CCyB has more than doubled since the onset of the pandemic, though from very low levels. 11 countries have positive rates for sectoral or broad-based systemic risk buffers. All these capital buffers, provide at least some macroprudential counter cyclical “firepower”. In addition, 15 countries have borrower-based measures in place.
The increasing use of the CCyB across countries reflects important lessons learnt from the pandemic, namely that releasable buffers are a key instrument to reduce pro-cyclicality and that they should be available in normal times to enhance the ability of authorities to respond to a wide set of possible shocks. Macroprudential authorities in several countries have recently increased the flexibility of their CCyB frameworks in this direction. At the ECB, we strongly support this positive neutral cyclical buffer approach.
With this characterisation of the conjunctural situation, let me offer a few specific reflections on how research can support policy-making in the face of current challenges.
The first concerns macroprudential capital buffer releases. Deciding the appropriate timing for the release of accumulated macroprudential buffers is challenging. In our view, this decision should be linked to clear constraints in the supply of bank credit due to banks’ capital positions. While research so far has focused on broader macro-financial signals for capital releases, I see scope to complement this work with analyses of conditions and banks’ behaviour that would justify releases. This would surely help making capital releases more effective in reducing the pro-cyclical effects of bank credit in periods of economic distress.
The second reflection concerns positive neutral capital buffers. As I have mentioned, this approach is increasingly being used across countries, including those in the banking union. Models to assess the overall benefits of the positive neutral versus a purely risk-based buffer framework could be very useful in substantiating policy makers’ support for this approach.
Finally, so far, I focussed on macroprudential capital. But this year reminded us that also liquidity issues can become quickly systemic. On the one hand, we saw shocks to market liquidity in the United Kingdom last autumn, when price falls in core government bond markets led to forced selling by non-bank financial intermediaries, and risked becoming self-reinforcing. On the other hand, earlier this year we saw shocks to funding liquidity, where deposit redemptions at an unparalleled speed led to the largest ever bank failures in the United States, and the abrupt merger of a global systemically important Swiss bank following liquidity outflows.
These episodes are a stark reminder that more efforts are needed to understand and mitigate systemic liquidity risks. Increased digitalisation and use of social media may at some point require a review of the design of microprudential liquidity standards for banks, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio. More importantly, the gradual and system-wide decline in liquidity implies that a macroprudential perspective on liquidity will become more relevant going forward. In principle, the existing regulation already provides some scope to introduce liquidity measures for systemic liquidity risk for banks. In contrast, regulation of liquidity risk in the non-bank financial sector is more nascent. Recent efforts by the Financial Stability Board to address the liquidity mismatch for investment funds are a welcome development but more needs to be done to address the system-wide perspective.
To conclude, research in these areas and beyond is essential for our work and can help the young macroprudential policy to thrive and grow to full maturity."

IMF Annual Meetings, 14 October 2023
Introduction
Following the devastating earthquake in Morocco, I wish to express my heartfelt solidarity with the Moroccan people as well as with the victims of other recent natural disasters.
Although the global economic outlook has remained broadly the same since our previous meeting in April, growth prospects across major economies have been changing, with the outlook for major advanced economies proving more resilient than expected. However, the recovery prospects for the global economy remain fragile amid persisting geopolitical tensions, stemming in particular from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising trade fragmentation and the possibility of renewed financial sector stress. Global headline inflation is receding, but underlying inflationary pressures remain persistent as labour markets continue to be tight.
The ECB is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. In order to reinforce progress towards the target, the Governing Council decided at its September meeting to raise the key interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing the total rate increase since July 2022 to 450 basis points. Moreover, as of July this year, the Eurosystem is no longer reinvesting principal payments from maturing securities under the asset purchase programme. On the basis of our latest assessment, we consider that our key interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.
Economic activity
The euro area economy has slowed markedly over the past year. Having broadly stagnated over the first half of this year, real GDP is expected to remain subdued in the coming months. Incoming data suggest that activity has been weak in the third quarter, as slower global demand and the impact of tighter financing conditions weigh on growth. Manufacturing continues to suffer, while the services sector, having shown resilience in the first half of the year, has now also started to weaken. Economic momentum should pick up over time, as falling inflation and higher wages will increasingly support real incomes and lead to renewed growth in consumer spending. On the labour market, the unemployment rate was at a record low in July and employment growth remained resilient in the first half of the year, albeit that momentum is slowing.
As the energy crisis fades, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures. This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for an even stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, such as high-quality public investment and structural reforms, can help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green transition.
Risks to the outlook continue to be tilted to the downside. Growth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy turn out to be more forceful than expected, or if the world economy weakens further and geopolitical risks intensify. On the other hand, growth could also be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty boost confidence among consumers and businesses and lead them to spend more.
Inflation
Since peaking in October 2022, euro area headline inflation has more than halved. The decline is broad-based across the main components of inflation and reflects falling energy commodity prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the impact of tighter monetary policy. Core inflation remains at elevated levels, reflecting the fact that the fading impact of the past surge in input costs is being counterbalanced by rising labour costs. Indeed, employees demanding compensation for the loss in purchasing power amid tight labour markets has resulted in historically high wage growth. We expect euro area inflation to continue to decrease, owing to easing cost pressures as well as the impact of tighter monetary policy. Wage growth is expected to decline gradually, albeit remaining high over the projection horizon, driven by increases in minimum wages and inflation compensation in a context of tight, though cooling, labour markets. Profit margins, which expanded notably last year, are expected to provide some buffer to the pass-through of labour costs to final prices in the medium term. Inflation is expected to decline to levels close to 2% in 2025. However, the downward path has risks in both directions. Upside risks stem from renewed upward energy and food cost pressures, a de-anchoring of inflation expectations above our target, and higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins. The downside risks include weaker demand, due for example to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or to a worsening of the international economic environment.
Euro area banking sector, non-bank financial intermediation and financial stability
The euro area financial system has shown resilience in the face of weakening growth prospects and continued high inflation. Financial stability concerns are shifting from the immediate impact of rapidly increasing interest rates and related asset price movements to the more medium-term and gradual effects of tighter financial conditions for financial and non-financial sectors.
Banking sector profitability has so far benefited, in aggregate, from the higher interest rate environment. Banks continue to hold sizeable liquidity buffers and have further improved their capital position. Asset quality remains robust, although early signs of deterioration are becoming visible. Micro- and macroprudential policies and supervision have contributed to the resilience of the banking system, with our recent stress test showing that banks could withstand a severe economic downturn. Banks should nonetheless remain attentive to asset quality, liquidity and funding risks, and exercise prudent and forward-looking risk management. Moreover, banks need to have credible strategies to advance their business models, considering in particular the digitalisation of financial services. Governance and risk management frameworks should keep pace with the acceleration of climate-related financial risks. Looking ahead, maintaining resilience in the euro area financial system remains a priority for macroprudential policy, as capital buffers limit potential consequences of shocks.
Despite the recent portfolio de-risking, credit and liquidity risks in the non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) sector continue to be elevated.NBFIs thus remain vulnerable to asset price corrections amid macroeconomic uncertainty, volatile markets and a turning of the real estate cycle.Several types of investment funds, including real estate funds, show sizeable mismatches between asset liquidity and redemption terms. Additionally, some NBFIs exhibit material leverage on and off the balance sheet. An important lesson from recent market shocks is the need to significantly boost the resilience of the NBFI sector. This requires a comprehensive strengthening of the policy framework for non-banks, including from a macroprudential perspective, in an internationally coordinated manner.
Supporting global cooperation
We welcome the good progress Ukraine has made on its programme under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility. In view of the prolonged war, continued support for Ukraine by the IMF and the international community is crucial. On Ukraine’s side, strong ownership and reform momentum will need to be maintained to pave the way for the programme’s success and to support reconstruction efforts.
Amid increasing fragmentation dynamics, international cooperation is more important than ever. We support a strong IMF at the centre of the global financial safety net. A solid capital position is a precondition for the IMF to be able to appropriately support its members, particularly the most vulnerable ones. We welcome the spirit of compromise which enabled the conclusion of the review of IMF precautionary instruments, given their important role in crisis prevention. Going forward, the impact of the expanded access by countries to IMF resources should be closely monitored, while the signalling effect of precautionary instruments should be retained.
EU Member States and central banks are playing their part in the IMF and in the recent drive for resources. With pledges of more than USD 31 billion, they have made a significant contribution and lead the way in transferring resources to IMF Trusts (Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and Resilience and Sustainability Trust).
Geoeconomic tensions have increased in recent years, in particular with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These tensions may result in a regionalisation of international trade and value chains. Trade fragmentation could be damaging to the global economy, reducing efficiency in the allocation of resources, hindering diffusion of innovations and limiting access to external financing. Ultimately, global production could be lower and prices higher – to the detriment of the poorest. Geopolitical tensions could also lead to foreign direct investments segmenting along geopolitical lines and global payment systems becoming more fragmented, thus reversing some of the gains from financial integration. This would not only reduce global risk sharing but also limit opportunities for channelling funds towards investments needed to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In view of these risks, multilateral cooperation remains essential.
This also holds true for filling the investment gap to achieve international climate goals as there will be high social costs if we get the green transition wrong. Large cross-border investment flows are needed, which requires further convergence and accurate assessment of national and international frameworks. In addition, we need to create an environment in which climate finance is levelled up steeply to fund the transition, and in which public finance works as a catalyst for increased private capital flows. The EU is working towards those objectives and has enshrined both a long-term net-zero goal with the European Green Deal as well as medium-term targets with its “Fit for 55” package. Our second economy-wide climate stress test has recently shown that a delayed or late-push transition would negatively affect banks’ credit risk, which would rise by more than 100% by 2030 compared with 2022. In an accelerated transition, on the other hand, this increase would be 40% lower."

Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the First Annual Conference organised by the Central Bank of Cyprus
Limassol, 4 October 2023
Introduction
I will start by giving you an overview of the economic outlook for the euro area before going on to look at how the ECB has adjusted its monetary policy to this outlook. I will then discuss in more detail the transmission of our monetary policy in the current environment and the sources of uncertainty that appear particularly relevant at this stage.
The outlook for inflation and growth in the euro area
Economic activity broadly stagnated over the first half of the year and is likely to remain subdued in the coming months. Weaker foreign demand and tight financing conditions are dampening growth, especially in the manufacturing sector. The services sector, which had been resilient so far, is now starting to “catch down” to manufacturing.
The labour market remains resilient despite the slowdown in activity, with the unemployment rate standing at its historical low of 6.4 per cent in August. However, there are signs that labour market momentum is slowing as the economy weakens. The employment Purchasing Managers’ Index declined significantly between the second and the third quarters of 2023, despite a slight uptick in September. The services sector, which has been a major driver of employment growth since mid-2022, is now also creating fewer jobs.
In September ECB staff revised down projected GDP growth, particularly for this year and next, due to a greater contractionary effect from tightening financing conditions and the weakening international trade environment. Beyond the near term, ECB staff expect growth to recover owing to higher real disposable income thanks to rising wages and falling inflation, which is set to underpin spending.ECB staff now expect the euro area economy to expand by 0.7% in 2023, 1.0% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025.
Inflation fell markedly from its double-digit peak last October, with the headline rate having declined to 4.3% in September (flash estimate). In the coming months, the sharp increases recorded in the autumn of 2022 will drop out of the yearly rates, lending further support to a deceleration in inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain strong, although most measures of inflation have started to ease thanks to aggregate demand and supply becoming more aligned and lower energy prices in recent months being passed on to other parts of the economy. Labour costs are increasingly contributing to domestic inflation, while the latest data indicate that the contribution of profits fell for the first time since early 2022. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2%, but the increase in some indicators needs to be closely monitored.
The September ECB staff macroeconomic projections see average inflation at 5.6% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. Compared with the June Eurosystem staff projections, this is an upward revision for 2023 and 2024 – which mainly reflects a higher projected path for energy prices – and a downward revision for 2025. ECB staff have revised down slightly the projected path for inflation excluding energy and food, to an average of 5.1% in 2023, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. This is on account of tighter financing conditions – which also reflect the restrictive impact of our monetary policy tightening – and a weaker economic outlook.
The ECB’s monetary policy response
In summary, while inflation continues to decline, it is still expected to remain too high for too long. The ECB is determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. In order to reinforce progress towards this target, we decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at the September meeting of the Governing Council. This decision was informed by the three legs of our reaction function: first, the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data; second, the dynamics of underlying inflation; and third, the strength of monetary policy transmission. Having raised interest rates by a total of 450 basis points since July 2022, we consider that the key ECB interest rates have now reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. Our reaction function will continue to serve as the framework for future decisions, and we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of a restrictive monetary policy stance.
Uncertainty regarding the transmission of monetary policy
As part of this data-dependent approach, we continually assess how monetary policy is transmitted to financing conditions, the real economy and, ultimately, to inflation. In the current hiking cycle, the first leg of monetary policy transmission – to financing conditions – has been very strong. Compared with previous hiking cycles, firms’ lending rates have increased at a faster pace and credit volumes have weakened more markedly. Transmission to the bank lending channel is likely to continue unfolding as lenders may become more prudent in light of rising funding costs and a slowing economy. Moreover, interest rates on outstanding debt will continue to increase as loans are progressively repriced. All in all, in my view, the transmission of our policy tightening to financing conditions seems to be well underway.
The second leg of transmission relates to the way in which changes in financing conditions will affect economic activity, as firms and households adjust their plans for consumption, investment and savings accordingly. The transmission of monetary policy tightening to the real economy is proceeding at a slower pace, with a substantial share of the transmission still in the pipeline. For example, real estate activity has slowed down amid the weakening of property valuations. For the economy as a whole, model-based estimates continue to suggest that, owing to the typical lags in monetary transmission, the bulk of the impact of our tightening is expected to materialise only in the course of this year and thereafter.[1]The downward impact of our tightening so far on GDP and inflation is estimated to average around 2 percentage points over the 2023-25 period, with the strongest effect expected on GDP growth this year and on inflation over the next two years.
It is also worth noting that the speed of transmission varies across the euro area. In particular, the transmission to households is likely to be faster in countries where variable rate mortgages predominate over mortgages at fixed rate.
At the same time, uncertainties regarding transmission remain, mainly in relation to two sources. First, the current hiking cycle is unprecedented in speed. Moreover, it follows a long period of accommodative monetary policy and was accompanied by the recalibration of balance sheet policies, all of which limits comparability with historical regularities. Second, the tightening of our policy stance occurred in reaction to an unprecedented constellation of shocks hitting the euro area over the last three years, which had a disruptive effect on economic conditions and the inflation environment. The fact that we are still confronted with the overlapping legacy effects of these shocks may imply that monetary policy transmission is proceeding differently this time around compared with what historical regularities might suggest.
The euro area and the world economy are also exposed to a variety of risks that accompany this monetary policy tightening. Based on our latest assessment, risks to economic growth in the euro area are tilted to the downside. Growth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than expected or if the world economy weakens at a faster pace than currently projected, owing, for example, to a continued slowdown in China. This may, in turn, dampen domestic economic activity and encourage firms, banks and households to be more cautious, thereby putting a strain on bank credit supply, investment and consumer spending. The tightening impulse may be transmitted more forcefully to the real economy in an environment of this kind owing to acceleration effects that often operate during periods of subdued growth and high uncertainty.[2]Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more.
On the inflation side, weaker demand owing to the stronger transmission of monetary policy or the worsening of the international economic environment could put stronger downward pressure on prices than currently expected. Conversely, renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food – with oil prices having already increased in recent months – and the unfolding climate crisis could push commodity prices up by more than expected. The role of wage dynamics and fiscal policy are of great importance in determining the future path of inflation. Wages have been catching up; elevated wage growth is therefore embedded in our projections, albeit at a decelerating pace. But a lasting increase in inflation expectations above our target owing, for instance, to higher-than-anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Similarly, as the energy crisis fades, governments are rolling back the fiscal support measures implemented during the crisis. But a slower rollback of this fiscal support or an expansionary fiscal policy stance in the coming years would pose significant challenges to taming inflation and bringing it back to our target. The challenging macroeconomic environment requires a consistent mix of monetary and fiscal policies, with greater risks to price stability if these policies pull in opposite directions.
Conclusion
To conclude, while we can be sure that our monetary policy tightening is transmitted forcefully to financial markets and is increasingly leaving a footprint in the real economy, the speed and scope of the transmission remain uncertain. This is partly due to the still-fluid economic environment in which we are navigating, with the outlook for inflation and economic activity being rendered particularly uncertain owing to both the legacy effects of previous shocks and renewed risks. In addition, the current hiking cycle is unique, with the sequence of rate hikes being unprecedented in speed.
Taking a longer-term view, structural changes in economic interactions may also exert upward pressure on inflation in a more fundamental way. At the global level, changes in trade patterns and energy markets, rising climate-related risks and the commitment to decarbonise the economy, as well as geopolitical risks, may have longer-lasting implications, which could pose greater challenges to price stability.
For these reasons, any assessment based on comparisons with historical regularities and model-based estimates must be complemented by real-time monitoring of the transmission to financial and economic conditions. While there are signs of the strength of the first leg of the transmission, a substantial share of the transmission from financing conditions to the real economy is expected to still be in the pipeline, subject to longer lags. This reinforces the need for a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of a restrictive monetary policy stance."

Welcome address by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the ECB Conference on Monetary Policy: bridging science and practice
Frankfurt am Main, 4 October 2023
It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the 2023 ECB Conference on Monetary Policy.
The last few years have been an incredibly challenging time for monetary policymakers around the world.
We have faced a succession of overlapping supply and demand shocks that have created a complex and fast-changing macroeconomic landscape.
And as a result, we have seen a paradigm shift in monetary policymaking.
Where central banks in advanced economies once wrestled with overcoming the lower bound on interest rates, they have more recently been engaging in the fastest hiking cycle on record.
But policymaking, by nature, operates in real time. We make decisions based on the best analysis and data at hand. However, it is exactly when rapid shifts in the macroeconomic environment occur that prior, unforeseen knowledge gaps are suddenly exposed.
This is why policymakers – who are practitioners at heart – can benefit greatly from cutting-edge research. Fresh insights and innovative approaches can go a long way in closing those knowledge gaps, helping policymakers to navigate this new terrain more effectively.
That is why this conference is called “bridging science and practice” – because the issues we are discussing are truly those that are informing our policymaking.
Today’s event captures four such topics.
The first topic is how the transition from the low inflation regime, which prevailed before the pandemic, to the high inflation rates we are seeing today affected the pass-through of shocks.
The papers to be presented over the next two days provide important contributions to that important debate.
In particular, we will see evidence that the propagation of adverse supply shocks is non-linear: when inflation is high, the propagation is stronger. And we will see how firms’ pricing strategies can become state-dependent and make prices more flexible in response to large shocks.
The second topic on which the conference focuses follows naturally from the first.
With such a rapid shift in the inflation outlook, there has been an equally rapid shift in the stance of monetary policy. And this has raised questions about how best to calibrate policy when accommodation must be quickly withdrawn after a long phase of loosening.
We will see research that highlights some of the challenges that can arise. For example, we will hear about the challenges for financial stability and how unwinding unconventional measures can affect the control of short-term interest rates – a theme that is relevant for the ongoing review of the ECB’s operational framework.
This rapid shift in the policy stance is also providing us with new insights into the third topic covered by the conference: the transmission of monetary policy.
There has been much debate in recent years about the strength and speed of monetary transmission and how the relative importance of different channels has changed over time. And this has injected considerable uncertainty into the current tightening cycle.
But research is now starting to come in that gives us a clearer picture.
We will hear about how the heterogeneous structure of the housing market in the euro area can lead to the asymmetric transmission of policy across countries. And we will see how models which account for the uneven exposure of households to policy changes can explain some of the features of transmission that we see today.
The fourth topic is the interaction between different policies.
One of the defining features of the response to the pandemic was the alignment between monetary and fiscal policies, which yielded an unexpectedly strong recovery. And that strong recovery – and the resulting rise in inflation – has been accompanied by global monetary policy tightening, unprecedented in its synchronisation.
We will see the implications of these policy interactions addressed in the presentations over the coming days. And let me also add: for the first time since we have been holding this conference, some of the contributions will come from the three young economists we have selected, who will have a dedicated session tomorrow.
Finally, we are privileged to have keynote speeches from two Nobel laureates – both of which are highly relevant for the challenges that policymakers are tackling today.
Douglas Diamond will talk to us about interest rate risk, financial crises and bank supervision – a relationship that policymakers everywhere have become more alert to in light of the recent episodes of banking turmoil in the United States and Switzerland.
And Peter Diamond will discuss the labour market and monetary policy, which is perhaps the greatest puzzle facing monetary policymakers across advanced economies today.
It is through path-breaking research, such as the findings we will hear at this conference, that policymakers’ knowledge can grow. But of course, we do not yet have all the answers – not least because of the heightened uncertainty we face.
For this reason, the ECB has set up its policy framework to be robust to the complexity and uncertainty of this landscape. Specifically, we have made our future decisions contingent on three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
This framework has helped us chart a tightening path that began steeply and then slowed to a more normal pace. Now, based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our medium-term target.
Our future decisions will continue to be based on these three criteria and they will ensure that the interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.
I wish you a fascinating and productive conference."

Opening remarks by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the joint IEA-ECB-EIB High-Level International Conference on “Ensuring an orderly energy transition: Europe’s competitiveness and financial stability in a period of global energy transformation”
Paris, 29 September 2023
It is a pleasure to be here at today’s conference organised together with the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), the first time our institutions have joined forces like this.
The recent years have shown that volatile energy prices and persistent shifts in energy markets can have significant implications for inflation dynamics.
Despite our different mandates, we therefore have a shared interest in an orderly energy transition.
In the last few years, two points about this transition have become increasingly clear.
The first is thatthe scientific consensus on climate change is being borne out.
Everywhere we look, we see natural disasters becoming more frequent and more severe, with the floods in Greece and Libya being the latest examples. Over the past fifty years, the number of weather-related disasters has increased by a factor of five.[1]
The second point is that there will be high social costs if we get the green transition wrong.
Last year’s energy crisis was unrelated to the green transition, but it highlighted how vulnerable we are to energy price volatility. And that drew attention to the potential burden decarbonisation might put both on industry and people, increasing support for those who favour delaying climate action.
So how can we meet the urgency of the challenge – but also be less disruptive?
To my mind, there are three key elements of a smooth transition: avoiding procrastination, understanding the challenge, and sharing the burden fairly.
Avoiding procrastination
First, while it is tempting to think that we can smooth out the cost of the transition by pushing back climate targets, the evidence suggests that this will not be the case.
Procrastinating is likely to increase the bill we will end up having to pay. In our recently published economy-wide climate stress test, we showed that under a late-push transition, the most vulnerable banks would face loan portfolio losses twice as high as the median.[2]
And pushing back targets will not buy us more time for the investment required. The latest ECB survey on the access to finance of enterprises for the first time included a question on what encourages or hinders green investment. The answers, published this week, are clear – according to firms, stricter climate standards provide a stronger incentive to invest than the physical impact of climate change.[3]
In other words, procrastinating will mean we run the risk of ending up in a halfway house where we are phasing out polluting energy sources before we can replace them with clean ones – a recipe for more price volatility and political backlash.
Understanding the challenge
The second element of a smooth transition is understanding the challenge. And by this I mean the specific obstacles that firms are facing in investing in the green transition.
Our survey of euro area firms shows that companies are ready to spend: three-quarters have already made or plan to make climate-related investments within the next five years. But the cost of financing these investments is an issue. More than half of firms – and 60% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – indicated that too high financing costs pose very significant obstacles.
This underscores the need to foster the market for green finance in Europe, which would reduce risk premium and lower financing costs. In this context, let me highlight two results of our survey.
First, firms view subsidised loans from public sources as an important tool to reduce the cost of green investments, and more than one-third said they would use them in the future.
However, around half the firms surveyed said that public guarantees were insufficient – an issue today’s conference will aim to address.
Second, nearly 40% of firms see lack of investor willingness to finance green investment as a very significant obstacle. At a time when huge pools of private capital are searching for environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, this points towards a major inefficiency in Europe.
This is why I have consistently emphasised the need to complete the EU’s capital markets union (CMU) as a way to expand the investor base to which European firms have access. And particularly important is what I have referred to as “green CMU”.
Europe is the location of choice for green bond issuance, with almost 60% of all green senior unsecured bonds issued globally last year originating here. It would be a huge missed opportunity not to build on the head start we have in this area to meet this financing challenge.
Clearly, fostering the market for green finance requires a combined policy effort involving multiple public institutions. As public institutions, we therefore need to ask how we can contribute within our mandates. This is also a key part of understanding the challenge.
For the ECB, the most important contribution we can make is to maintain price stability.
For any type of fixed investment, price stability is crucial as it gives firms visibility on how their costs will evolve over time. But for green investments, which often do not provide returns until many years down the line, it is even more important that prices are expected to remain stable.
This is especially true because, as our survey shows, a significant share of green investments are financed through retained earnings. Without price stability, these funds will lose their value or be redirected towards inflation-protected investments, both of which would hinder investment in riskier green technologies.
But insofar as price stability is assured, we can also act to protect our balance sheet from climate risk and thereby support the green transition – which we are already doing.
The measures we have taken include sharpening incentives by tilting our corporate bond purchases towards companies with a better climate performance, limiting the share of assets issued by entities with a high carbon footprint that can be pledged as collateral in our operations, and having stricter disclosure requirements.[4]
For 2024 and beyond, we will consider ways to continue addressing climate considerations in our monetary policy.
Sharing the burden fairly
The third element of a smooth transition is sharing the burden fairly.
If we succeed in frontloading green investment, there will be short-term costs and related backlashes. For example, as I mentioned in a recent speech, we could see stronger price pressures in commodities markets owing to the resource intensity of green technologies.[5]And we know that can lead to a greater loss of welfare for those with the lowest incomes.[6]
But here we can learn from what worked during the energy crisis.
The fiscal measures adopted to cap high energy prices and support incomes were effective in containing aggregate inflation and, crucially, in reducing inequality. New ECB research has found that these measures compensated euro area households for about one-third of their welfare loss; in some countries, households were almost fully compensated.[7]
The energy crisis was a one-off event and hopefully we will not need such large fiscal outlays in the future. But this experience suggests that, to ensure the fairness of the transition, temporary measures that help the most vulnerable should remain part of the policy toolkit.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The green transition poses a uniquely difficult policy challenge, because the stakes of failure are so high and yet the path to success is so complex.
But the answer to this challenge is not to dilute our ambition. It is not to detract our focus from the goal of net zero. And it is not to delay the time for action.
The answer is to follow through with the transition by understanding the challenges it entails and ensuring that the costs are shared fairly.
By bringing together a wide range of expertise and intellectual and financial firepower, this conference provides us with a unique opportunity to map such a strategy out.
I wish us every success in this endeavour."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 25 September 2023
I am very pleased to be back in Brussels for our regular exchange.
Since our last hearing in June, the ECB has made further progress in its efforts to bring inflation back to its 2% medium-term target. In order to reinforce progress towards our target, we decided at our latest meeting to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. And, based on our current assessment, we consider that our rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target.
In my short remarks today, I will outline our latest assessment of the outlook for the economy and inflation and explain our latest decisions. I will also briefly address the two topics selected by this Committee for today’s hearing: excess liquidity and the fiscal-monetary policy mix.
Outlook for the euro area economy
Euro area activity broadly stagnated in the first half of 2023, and recent indicators point to further weakness in the third quarter. Lower demand for euro area exports and the impact of tight financing conditions are dampening growth, including through lower residential and business investment. The services sector, which had been resilient until recently, is now also weakening.
The labour market has so far remained resilient despite the slowing economy, with the unemployment rate staying at its historical low of 6.4% in July. But while employment grew by 0.2% in the second quarter, job creation in the services sector is moderating and overall momentum is slowing.
Looking further ahead, economic momentum is expected to pick up as consumer spending and real incomes rise, supported by falling inflation, rising wages and a strong labour market. Our latest staff projections forecast growth of 0.7% in 2023, 1.0% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025.
Turning to inflation, headline inflation continued its decline from its peak in October last year reaching 5.2% in August, down from 5.3% in July. Energy inflation ticked up in August from its downward path but remained negative at -3.3%. Food price inflation has come down from its peak in March but is still high, standing at almost 10% in August.
Inflation excluding energy and food fell from 5.5% in July to 5.3% in August, and most measures of underlying inflation continued to moderate.
At the same time, domestic price pressures remain strong. Services inflation is still being kept up by strong spending on holidays and travel and by high wage growth. In the second quarter, the contribution of labour costs to annual domestic inflation increased, partially due to weaker productivity. In contrast, the contribution of profits fell for the first time since early 2022.
Our latest staff projections show that inflationary pressures are expected to moderate and that inflation is set to reach our target by the end of 2025. It is projected to fall from 5.6% in 2023 to 3.2% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025.
The ECB’s monetary policy
We remain determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. To reinforce progress towards our target, we decided to raise our key interest rates by 25 basis points earlier this month.
Based on our latest assessment, we consider that our policy rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. In any case, our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach, basing our decisions on our assessment of the inflation outlook in the light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Excess liquidity
Let me now briefly turn to excess liquidity, which you have chosen as a topic for today’s hearing.[1]
The shift to a full allotment system during the financial crisis and the adoption of new monetary policy instruments have resulted in a strong rise in commercial banks’ holdings of central bank money.
The surplus of funds over minimum reserves is referred to as excess liquidity. The funds are held as overnight deposits with the Eurosystem, remunerated at the deposit facility rate, and exceed the level of minimum reserves[2], which are now remunerated at 0%.[3]
The amount of excess liquidity has decreased by more than one trillion euros over the past twelve months, for two main reasons. First, the repayments of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). And second, the reduction of the securities held under the asset purchase programme (APP), with reinvestments being fully discontinued as of July this year.[4]
Additional TLTRO repayments and the gradual rundown of the APP portfolio will also cause our balance sheet to shrink over the coming years, further reducing excess liquidity.
At the same time, Eurosystem staff is analysing the optimal long-run size and composition of our balance sheet – and by implication, the adequate level of excess liquidity. This is not a trivial issue as it has implications for the way we implement monetary policy. It is also an issue that is relevant for all major central banks, as the environment in which we operate has undergone fundamental changes over the past decade.
To this end, we are conducting a comprehensive review of the operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, assessing the costs and benefits of alternative regimes. We aim to conclude this review by spring 2024 and we will of course report to this Committee on the outcome.
Conclusion
Allow me to conclude.
The last few years have been particularly turbulent, with unprecedented shocks hitting Europe. Decisive progress in your parliamentary term has shown that Europe can stick together, respond to challenges and emerge stronger.
But important legislative work remains to be done before next year’s elections. Making progress on banking union, capital markets union and the digital euro rests in your hands. Your involvement is also crucial for the second topic chosen for today’s hearing: ensuring the right mix of fiscal and monetary policies in the euro area.
Before the pandemic, fiscal policy was often procyclical. But the response to the pandemic was different. National fiscal policies responded countercyclically to the downturn, working in tandem with monetary policy and supervisory measures.
As the energy crisis fades, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures. At the same time, fiscal policies should be designed to make the euro area economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt.
A robust economic governance framework is overwhelmingly in our common interest. Agreement on the reform of the EU’s fiscal framework should therefore be reached by the end of the year.
We have outlined four priorities in our ECB opinion, which I would summarise in four key guideposts:[5]lower sovereign debt and lower heterogeneity of debt levels across countries. Higher growth and higher countercyclicality of fiscal policy.
Now is the time to move forward on this dossier, and I count on this Committee to play its part in ensuring a timely adoption.
Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to your questions."

Thünen Lecture by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the annual conference of the Verein für Socialpolitik
Regensburg, 25 September 2023
In the two and a half years following the outbreak of the pandemic, the sum of currency in circulation and overnight bank deposits in the euro area, referred to as M1, increased by over 30%. Over the same period, inflation accelerated from 1.2% to 9.1%. It peaked at 10.6% in October 2022.
The concurrence of these developments sparked a renewed debate on the relationship between money growth and inflation. Some commentators saw the rise in inflation as proof of the validity of the quantity theory of money, arguing that nominal wages and prices could not keep on rising if money did not expand correspondingly.[1]For others, the correlation was spurious and held little economic significance.[2]
In my remarks today, I would like to discuss the role of money in explaining the recent surge in inflation in the euro area. I will start by reviewing the reasons why most central banks relegated the analysis of monetary developments to the background.
I will then ask whether the rise in money growth in the wake of the pandemic was a harbinger of the surge in inflation. In answering this question, I will explain what has caused broad money growth, including the role of the monetary and fiscal responses to the pandemic, and how the money that was created by these measures may have affected the way in which firms and households responded to supply chain disruptions and the sharp increase in energy prices.
In the final part of my lecture, I will show how the ECB’s determined tightening of monetary policy had an imminent and significant effect on monetary dynamics, supporting disinflation. However, the current, unusual contraction in monetary aggregates is unlikely to foreshadow a deep recession but rather reflects a significant rebalancing of portfolios after a long period of low interest rates. Hence, there is not yet an all-clear for the inflation problem.
My overall conclusion is that money growth still matters, and that it matters most in unstable conditions when adverse cost-push shocks risk lifting inflation away from the central bank’s target.
As such, the recent experience serves as a reminder that the quantity theory of money is not a vacuous concept of no practical importance for modern central banks. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the strong rise in broad money growth may have been an early and sufficiently robust sign that inflation would not simply fall all the way back to 2% on its own as supply shocks reversed, but that it would percolate through the economy and leave a more persistent footprint.
Inflation is not always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon
One of the central predictions of the quantity theory of money is that there is a long-run one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation.[3]It is perhaps the most celebrated and most controversial proposition in the economic science, going back at least to the mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus and the Polish King Sigismund in 1540.[4]
Conceptually, the quantity theory of money hinges on the existence of a stable long-run demand for real money balances, which is positively related to real income and inversely related to the opportunity cost of holding money.[5]If shifts in trend real income and low-frequency variations in nominal interest rates are comparatively limited, money growth and inflation will move one-for-one over sufficiently long periods of time.[6]
Such a relation does not imply that changes in the money stockcauseinflation. But empirically, both cross-sectional and time series evidence have for a long time provided strong support in favour of a stable long-run relationship between money and prices.
Across countries, the long-run averages of inflation and excess money growth, defined as the growth in broad money over and above the growth in real GDP, typically fall on or near the 45-degree line, consistent with the predictions of a one-to-one link.[7]This evidence essentially holds for the entire post-Second World War period (Slide 2, left-hand side).[8]
In countries where sufficiently long time series are available, low-frequency variation in money growth and inflation points to the same close relationship between the two series in the vast majority of cases (Slide 2, right-hand side).[9]
These findings are not confined to a particular type of model; they are empirical facts.
However, these facts did not prove robust over time. Most importantly, they were found to break down, or to weaken substantially, in an environment of low and stable inflation (Slide 3, left-hand side).[10]
Specifically, splitting samples over time revealed that the findings of a unit slope critically depended on the inclusion of high-inflation episodes, such as those during wartime periods in the 1910s and the 1940s, or in the aftermath of the oil price shocks in the 1970s (Slide 3, right-hand side).[11]Outside these episodes, it seemed inflation was not always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.
In some cases, the relationship between money growth and inflation could be recovered when controlling for shifts in trend real GDP growth and the impact of the secular decline in interest rates on the velocity of money.[12]
Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding money and raise the risk of capital losses from bond or stock holdings in case of rising interest rates. Hence, they tend to increase money holdings per unit of output, thereby lowering velocity (Slide 4, left-hand side).[13]Over the past few decades, such changes in money velocity have driven a wedge between money growth and inflation.
Nonetheless, even when controlling for such shifts, the evidence of a strong long-run link between inflation and money growth has become more limited and fragmented as inflation significantly and persistently declined from the mid-1980s onwards. The decline in inflation volatility during the Great Moderation made it harder to identify robust econometric evidence of the effect of money growth on inflation (Slide 4, right-hand side).[14]
An important implication is that changes in monetary policy regimes can significantly influence the relationship between money growth and inflation, especially if central banks move towards targeting inflation directly.[15]This can be seen as an instance of “Goodhart’s law”, which states that “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”.
The instability in the link between money growth and inflation gradually led to monetary aggregates playing less of a role as an intermediate target for central banks.[16]This tendency was reinforced by the rise of a class of New Keynesian models that were able to explain fluctuations in key macroeconomic time series despite money demand playing no role.[17]
The founders of the monetary union and the ECB still adopted a reference value – but no target – for broad money growth, building on the long-standing analytical framework of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Deviations from the reference value did not directly commit the ECB to adjust its policy. But it elevated money growth to an important variable in determining the policy response.[18]Symbolically, monetary analysis was the first, not the second, pillar of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy of 1998.[19]
In 2003, as part of the ECB’s evaluation of the monetary policy strategy, the annual review of the reference value was discontinued and the ranking of the pillars changed, starting with the economic analysis – focused on short to medium-term developments – before moving to the monetary analysis assessing medium to long-term inflation trends. Incidentally, this was in line with the growing consensus that the link between money growth and inflation had weakened since the 1980s.[20]
Since the 2021 strategy review, the Governing Council has based its policy decisions on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. While this assessment is still built on an economic analysis on the one hand and a monetary and financial analysis on the other, it recognises that a distinct monetary pillar is no longer essential for successfully conducting monetary policy.[21]
Could money growth have helped predict current inflation?
The post-pandemic surge in inflation has put the quantity theory of money to a new test. It raises the question whether the increase in excess money growth in 2020 was an early and sufficiently strong warning sign that risks to medium-term price stability were rising rapidly.[22]
These signs were not confined to the euro area. A simple visual inspection suggests that the size of the inflation shock was positively correlated with excess money growth across a sample of advanced and emerging economies (Slide 5).
That correlation was far away from the unitary relationship that the quantity theory of money would predict. Given the short horizon involved, this would also not have been expected. And yet, researchers of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that taking excess money growth into account would have helped to materially reduce inflation forecast errors in recent years.[23]
By itself, this evidence is intriguing. At least, it means that monetary aggregates remain important sources of information when assessing risks to price stability. It also suggests that the most famous monetarist proposition may not be dead after all.[24]It may simply have been dormant over the period of low and stable inflation, much as its New Keynesian counterpart, the Phillips curve.[25]
This view would correspond to the warning issued by Thomas Sargent and Paolo Surico in their seminal contribution in 2011: “if a monetary rule unleashes persistent and seemingly exogenous movements in money growth, … the quantity theory will come back.”[26]
At the same time, the mere fact that excess money growth helped predict inflation is not suggesting causality. The joint dynamics of inflation and money growth always depend on the nature of the shocks hitting the economy.
In other words, we need to understand what has caused the surge in money growth and inflation before drawing conclusions about whether monetary policy should have taken the signs from broad money growth more seriously.
This assessment seems especially relevant against the background of the vastly different experiences with quantitative easing (QE) over time in the euro area and beyond. While large-scale asset purchases after the global financial and euro area sovereign debt crises had only moderate effects on broad money growth and did not succeed in lifting inflation back to target, the expansion of central bank balance sheets in the wake of the pandemic coincided with strong growth in both variables.
This coincidence fuelled the narrative that QE was the cause of both inflation and broad money growth. And while that link might well exist, it is often prone to misconceptions. In reality, the relationship between asset purchases and money growth is much more subtle and complex.
Asset purchases and broad money growth
Asset purchases, together with targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), were our primary instruments for responding to the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, as our key policy rate was already in negative territory, and hence close to the effective lower bound.[27]
Asset purchases were highly effective in addressing illiquidity in financial markets in an environment in which traditional intermediaries were either unwilling, or unable, to provide liquidity to the market. And they were instrumental in reversing the sharp tightening in borrowing costs that resulted from the uncertain effects of the pandemic on the balance sheets of firms, households and governments.
Asset purchases affect monetary aggregates in different ways. When central banks purchase securities, they create new central bank reserves to pay for these transactions. Reserves can only be held by commercial banks, which use them to settle payments among themselves.
These reserves are part of the monetary base, or M0.[28]Because of QE, the monetary base increased in a mechanical way one-for-one after 2015, when the ECB launched its asset purchase programme (APP), and again during the pandemic, when we created the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and conducted further purchases under the APP (Slide 6).
The TLTROs further added to the large increase in base money. In these lending operations, banks could pledge collateral against central bank reserves and obtained funding at highly beneficial rates if they fulfilled certain lending criteria.
By contrast, the impact of these measures on broad money growth, M3, is much less mechanical.[29]TLTROs, for example, have no direct impact on M3. They only contribute to broad money growth to the extent that banks responded to the incentives provided for in the design of these operations.
For asset purchases, the effects on M3 are more convoluted. Specifically, the purchase of a bond by the central bank will result in a one-for-one increase in M3 if the ultimate seller of a security is a euro area household, non-financial firm or non-bank financial firm. In these cases, the proceeds from the sale are credited to the seller’s deposit account, raising broad money. Other cases, especially transactions with non-residents and banks, which are often the main counterparties, will leave M3 unchanged at the time of settlement.[30]
Over time, however, QE, much like the TLTROs, can have importantindirecteffects on broad money growth.[31]
Above all, QE compresses the yields on long-term debt securities, stimulating loan demand and supply as well as economic activity. Lower interest rates also make money holdings relatively more attractive by reducing the opportunity cost of holding money. These effects tend to raise M3.
On the other hand, if euro area residents use the proceeds from the sale of a bond to repay loans, to acquire foreign assets or to purchase financial instruments not included in M3, such as other long-term bonds, from non-money-holding institutions, the initial positive effect on broad money is reversed.[32]
In net terms, the impact of QE on M3 fundamentally depends on the strength of these indirect effects, which may vary over time. This can be seen when considering the money multiplier, which is the ratio of broad money to base money (Slide 7).
The multiplier was broadly constant until the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008. This was mainly because the injection of central bank reserves was demand-driven – that is, banks’ recourse to our operations depended on currency in circulation and banks’ reserve requirements, which are a function of banks’ short-term liabilities.[33]For that reason, M0 and M3 were expanding at a broadly similar pace.
But after the start of the APP, the multiplier fell measurably and persistently. It declined further when we launched the PEPP. This reflects the fact that, with QE, the quantity of reserves is, by and large, determined by the Eurosystem, resulting in a large amount of reserves in excess of banks’ liquidity needs.[34]
The banking system as a whole cannot escape the addition of new reserves, as purchases are always settled through banks, regardless of who the ultimate seller is. Importantly, banks do not draw on excess reserves to create new loans, as is sometimes suggested, with base money “multiplying” into broad money.
So, if there is no demand for credit, or if banks do not want to lend, because of risk considerations or capital requirements, asset purchases will not, on their own, affect broad money growth beyond their more limited direct mechanical impact.
The effects of asset purchases are state-dependent
It is now easy to see why the effect of QE on broad money growth, economic activity and inflation is highly state-dependent.
Between 2015 and 2018, when we first conducted large-scale asset purchases, the decline in long-term interest rates succeeded in lifting loan creation from depressed levels.
But broad money growth remained moderate overall, and inflation remained subdued, as loan demand and supply were held back by a combination of lacklustre growth and the need for balance sheet repair from the global financial and sovereign debt crises (Slide 8). In particular, governments were consolidating public finances and banks were in the process of building up capital buffers, as non-performing loans remained elevated (Slide 9).[35]
As a result, for the period before the pandemic, most empirical studies find that asset purchases had no, or a very limited, effect on the lending behaviour of banks across major economies. This explains the marked and persistent decline in the money multiplier in that period.
During the pandemic, however, the picture changed dramatically. Fiscal deficits soared as governments responded to the crisis with large transfers to households and firms. The primary deficit was 5.5% in 2020 and nearly 4% in 2021, reflecting an unprecedented fiscal stimulus.
Borrowing by firms rose sharply, too, often benefiting from government guarantees (Slide 10). Loan demand by firms went well beyond the drawdown of credit lines in 2020. Annual credit growth to firms peaked at nearly 9% in late 2022, after interest rates had already started rising. And lending by households for house purchases reached growth rates not seen since the global financial crisis.
So, in sharp contrast to the experience before the pandemic, the money multiplier fell only briefly (slide 7). From mid-2021 to mid-2022, broad monetary aggregates were increasing at the same pace as the monetary base. This was the case although asset purchases were still being conducted on a scale that led to an increase in the monetary base that was significantly larger than during the previous QE episode (Slide 6).
In effect, the transmission of monetary policy was a lot more powerful during that period. At the height of the pandemic, this was critical to safeguard financial stability and mitigate the social costs of the crisis.
But the demand for money went well beyond the initial “dash for cash”. Although uncertainty remained exceptionally high for a long time, the economy responded strongly to historically accommodative financing conditions, boosting credit creation. This reflected the solid balance sheets with which banks, households and firms had entered the crisis, as well as Europe’s common policy response, mainly through Next Generation EU, which mitigated fiscal borrowing constraints at national level.
Was money the grease that kept the wheels of inflation going?
What then – if any – was the role broad money growth played in facilitating the rise in inflation?
According to some commentators, the price surge over the past two years is the sole result of adverse supply-side shocks, first caused by pandemic-related disruptions to global value chains and later by the strong rise in energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
On this account, money growth played only a minor, ancillary role, as the surge in inflation was purely exogenous. The broadening of inflation to most goods and services was seen as simply reflecting the pass-through of the increase in input costs to final consumer prices, which would have happened with or without money growth.
This interpretation of recent events, however, naturally raises the question of why the pass-through of supply-side shocks to final consumer prices was so strong. After all, prices are always the sum of costs and profit margins. In the past, margins had often been a key shock absorber. In a downturn, unit labour costs typically increase as output falls faster than employment. Because reduced demand limits the scope for price increases, unit profits normally decline (Slide 11).
However, in recent years, unit profits have increased strongly despite the sharp rise in firms’ input costs. Such outcomes are atypical for purely exogenous cost-push shocks. Instead, they suggest that inflation was the outcome of the endogenous interaction between demand and supply, with consumers both willing and able to absorb significant price increases.
So, a different way to interpret the events of the past years is to suggest that demand was exceptionally resilient in the face of two of the largest economic shocks since the end of the Second World War, fuelling the rise in inflation. Money growth may play a different role in this scenario.
To see this, it is intriguing to look at the evolution of households’ real disposable income.
After the sovereign debt crisis, it took more than four years for real disposable income to recover to its pre-crisis level, weighing heavily and persistently on aggregate demand (Slide 12, left-hand side). At the height of the pandemic, it took only three months. And today, real disposable income is higher than a year ago.
These developments are, to a large extent, the result of significant money creation fuelled by the fiscal response to the crisis. Public transfers compensated households for the loss in income during pandemic lockdowns, and later for the loss in purchasing power from the energy shock (Slide 12, right-hand side). And by stabilising aggregate demand, these transfers paved the way for the rise in nominal wages and employment growth that is increasingly driving the growth in income today.
The money that was created was used in different ways by households. Part of it was used to finance the sharp increase in nominal consumption expenditures that allowed households to maintain their real consumption at a level close to that seen before the pandemic (Slide 13).
As such, money growth may have been the grease that kept the wheels of inflation going. It is likely to have been a sign that demand would be more resilient than in a typical downturn, with households less sensitive to price increases, thereby facilitating the pass-through of cost-push shocks to final consumer prices.
Moreover, lockdowns meant that a significant share of the money that was created was saved, boosting household balance sheets. By the end of 2022, households accumulated excess savings of around €860 billion, or about 10.6% of annual disposable income (Slide 14, left-hand side).
Part of these savings were held in liquid assets. In 2020 alone, household overnight bank deposits increased by €570 billion (Slide 14, right-hand side). Over time, however, most of the excess savings have been invested in stocks and bonds or were used to pay back outstanding loans.[36]As a result, households accumulated more wealth, also reflecting significant valuation gains as asset prices, especially house prices, increased measurably during the pandemic (Slide 15, left-hand side).
So, on aggregate, households essentially emerged from three years of crisis unscathed. Even households at the bottom of the wealth distribution managed to significantly deleverage between 2017 and 2021, as shown by our most recent household finance and consumption survey (Slide 15, right-hand side).
The resilience of households’ income and balance sheets, in turn, is likely to have contributed to the significant credit demand by firms, which further fuelled broad money growth and sustained aggregate demand.
This money-based interpretation of inflation is consistent with three stylised facts.
First, a model-based decomposition of inflation into supply and demand factors suggests that demand played a significant role in generating underlying price pressures.[37]
Second, if inflation were money-driven, one would expect price changes to largely reflect common factors rather than sector-specific shocks.[38]This is precisely what we have seen in recent years. Today, the share of price changes across goods and services that can be explained by a common factor is about twice as high as before the pandemic (Slide 16).
Third, money velocity recovered gradually after the pandemic. This is a sign that spending was not held back by higher prices, contributing to firms being able to pass through rising input costs.
In this light, the findings by the BIS that money growth helped predict inflation, even over short horizons typically unrelated to the quantity theory of money, may seem less of a surprise. Money growth is likely to have been an underappreciated harbinger of risks to medium-term price stability.
Money is currently not a reliable measure of economic activity
The unprecedented rise in inflation necessitated a sharp tightening of monetary policy, which has been critical in paving the way for a timely return to price stability.
Since July last year, we have raised our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, by 4.50 percentage points – the steepest tightening cycle in the history of the euro area (Slide 17, left-hand side). We are also reducing our balance sheet, as banks are paying back the TLTROs and as we no longer reinvest the proceeds from maturing government bonds under the APP (Slide 17, right-hand side).
All these measures are having a material effect on money dynamics, supporting disinflation.[39]Since we started raising interest rates, broad money growth M3 has slowed down sharply and has turned negative on an annual basis in July (Slide 18, left-hand side). Lending to firms and households has essentially stalled.
Developments in narrower monetary aggregates are even more striking. The stock of M1 is contracting at a fast pace (Slide 18, left-hand side). In July, it was more than 9% below its level a year ago. This is unprecedented: on an annual basis, M1 had not once declined since records began in the 1970s.
These developments have sparked concerns that monetary policy may now be at risk of overtightening. In the past, real CPI-deflated M1 growth has been a reliable leading indicator for all recessions in the euro area (Slide 18, right-hand side).[40]
While activity in the euro area economy is clearly moderating, there are two reasons why monetary developments may currently not be a reliable measure of economic activity.
The first is that developments in real M1 growth have typically been more informative about futureturning pointsin real GDP growth than about thedepthof the downturn. Sharp declines in real M1 growth were often accompanied by relatively moderate declines in the annual growth rate of real GDP.
The second reason is that the volume of M1 critically depends on the opportunity cost of holding highly liquid, mostly overnight, deposits.
Before the pandemic, these opportunity costs were historically low, as asset purchases and other unconventional monetary policy measures compressed the spread between long-term and short-term interest rates.
As a result, the remuneration received by households and firms for holding overnight and time deposits was essentially identical, boosting M1 (Slide 19, left-hand side). Historically, M1 accounted for around 40% of M3. By the end of 2021, that share rose to 73%.
The sharp rise in interest rates has fundamentally changed this dynamic. Households and firms are actively and rapidly rebalancing their portfolios towards time deposits and other instruments with higher rates of remuneration, contributing to the sharp fall in M1 (Slide 19, right-hand side).[41]
Portfolio rebalancing has also resulted in “money destruction”, in the sense that depositors are using bank deposits to purchase instruments outside the scope of M3 from non-money-holding institutions. For example, over the past year households have almost doubled their holdings of government bonds, and they have built significant additional exposures to government debt through investment funds.
Given the still elevated share of M1 in M3, considerable further declines in M1 can be expected. For example, if the share were to fall back to its pre-global financial crisis level, M1 outflows could amount to around €2 trillion.[42]Similarly, current negative M3 growth is consistent with households and firms bringing their portfolios closer into line with historical regularities.
Such rebalancing of portfolios will not in itself affect consumption and savings decisions. Higher interest rates may induce households to save more. But these effects would come on top of the reallocation of the existing stock of savings.
Therefore, in the absence of other mechanisms at work, the current magnitude of the decline in real M1 growth says relatively little about the extent of the slowdown in economic activity in the euro area and the future evolution of inflation.[43]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In this speech, I asked the question whether money growth still matters for central banks.
The events of the past three years have shown that it does matter in particular economic circumstances.[44]
What are then the main takeaways for central banks? I see two areas of reflection.
One is that the extent to which the economy responds to an increase in the monetary base on the back of asset purchases fundamentally depends on the broader state of the economy, as reflected in its balance sheet capacity. On its own, QE is not inflationary. It only becomes inflationary if and when banks, households, firms and governments are both able and willing to respond to low interest rates, thereby boosting money growth, economic activity and, ultimately, inflation.
When looking at the experience before and after the pandemic, this distinction is perhaps what divides the “monetarists” – those claiming that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon – from those advocating the fiscal theory of the price level – the idea that there are instances where the price level is determined by government debt.[45]
The second takeaway is that excessive money growth can entrench adverse cost-push shocks. As such, it may have predictive power for risks to price stability that central banks need to monitor carefully. This is especially important for the future in which supply-side shocks, related to the green transition or structural changes in global value chains, threaten to drive inflation away from central banks’ targets more often than in the past.[46]Strong money growth may make such shocks more persistent.
All in all, while a distinct monetary pillar is no longer essential to conduct monetary policy, money deserves a firm place in central bankers’ analysis.
Thank you."

Dinner speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Marketeers of New York University
New York, 21 September 2023
Introduction
In my remarks this evening, I will assess the economic and inflation outlook in the euro area and explain last week’s monetary policy decision taken by the Governing Council of the ECB.
Before I turn to the most recent developments, let me start by recalling how we got to where we are today.[1]The 2021-2022 inflation surge in Europe was driven predominantly by an extraordinary combination of shocks. The pandemic generated a staggered sequence of sectoral supply-demand mismatches. Especially in 2021, the global rotation of spending from services towards goods — at a time when supply remained hampered by pandemic-related lockdowns — resulted in severe supply chain bottlenecks and fostered exceptional pricing power for producers of in-demand products. In Europe, after alternating waves of lockdowns and temporary reopenings, the economy fully reopened in the spring of 2022 at a time when the supply capacity in contact-intensive service sectors (especially the tourism and hospitability sectors) had not yet recovered from the prolonged shutdown phase. In parallel, the unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russia triggered an extraordinary surge in energy prices (and attendant terms of trade losses) that peaked in August 2022.
The scale and breadth of these shocks generated extraordinary shifts in sectoral relative prices. In principle, fluctuations in sectoral relative prices can be accommodated with no change in the overall inflation rate. However, in the presence of downward price rigidities and downward wage stickiness, this would have required an enormous tightening of monetary policy and depression of output. Together with the inevitable time lags in monetary policy transmission, this is the fundamental reason why central banks focus on medium-term inflation rather than seeking to deliver the inflation target continuously. In the euro area, inflation peaked at 10.6 per cent in October 2022. The peak inflation rate would have been even higher in the absence of the significant fiscal subsidies rolled out by euro area governments in the final months of 2022.
During 2023 many of these factors have reversed: energy prices have come down sharply from their peaks; supply conditions in global manufacturing and global trade have normalised; and demand-supply mismatches in contact-intensive sectors have moderated.
Inflation
Inflation in August stood at 5.2 per cent, meaning that about 60 per cent of the peak gap to our inflation target has faded away.Our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee inflation standing at 3.3 per cent in the final quarter of this year. While the lifting of fiscal subsidies means that inflation will only decline to a limited extent during 2024, to 2.9 per cent in the final quarter, it is projected that inflation will return to our two per cent target by the third quarter of 2025.
Within this overall trend, the nature of inflation is shifting. While external and pandemic-related factors have played a dominant role in the initial inflation surge and the partial fallback that has occurred this year, the full dynamic adjustment to these shocks involves a staggered reset of prices and wages across the economy, a process which is ongoing. Given the episodic nature of wage adjustment and the variety of institutional arrangements across the member countries, this is inevitably a multi-year process. I will return to this topic later.
The inflation outlook remains subject to considerable uncertainty. On one side, upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food. Adverse weather conditions, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up by more than expected. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. On the other side, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy or a worsening of the external environment – would lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term.
Economic activity
In terms of activity levels, output in the euro area broadly stagnated over the first half of this year. Manufacturing output is set to remain weak in view of further moderation in export demand and tight financing conditions, while past support from order backlogs is declining. Services have so far contributed positively to growth, due to the higher demand in contact-intensive sectors, but there have been clear signs of a slowdown since June.
In the near term, private consumption is expected to remain weak, while housing and business investment are seen as declining further, also driven by the monetary policy tightening. Over time, the economic momentum should pick up as real incomes are expected to rise, supported by falling inflation, rising wages and a strong labour market, which will underpin consumer spending. However, activity levels will be dampened as the policy tightening and adverse credit supply conditions increasingly feed through to the real economy. The expected gradual withdrawal of fiscal support is also likely to weigh on economic growth in the coming quarters.
The labour market has so far remained resilient despite the slowing economy but shows signs of losing momentum. The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.4 per cent in July. While employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, the latest survey data on employment growth came close to stalling. This indicates that employers have become more reluctant to hire in the face of deteriorating demand and gloomier prospects for the year ahead. In addition, strong labour demand has begun to moderate, with indicators of job vacancy rates edging down in recent months.
These developments are reflected in significant downward revisions for output growth in the September staff projections: annual average output growth is now projected at 0.7 per cent in 2023, 1.0 per cent in 2024 and 1.5 per cent in 2025. In terms of the quarterly profile, most of the markdown in activity is for 2023, with carry-over effects from this year accounting for much of the downward revision to the 2024 growth outlook.
The risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside. Economic growth could be slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than expected or if the world economy weakens owing, for instance, to a further slowdown in China. That said, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more.
Monetary policy transmission
Turning to our monetary policy, we have raised our policy rate by a cumulative 450 basis points over the last ten Governing Council meetings. The reimbursements of the third series of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) that have taken place so far and the slowdown and subsequent discontinuation of reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP) have reduced our balance sheet by €1.6 trillion and €109 billion respectively. By pushing up term premia and draining liquidity from the banking system, these ancillary policies are also contributing to the tightening in financing conditions, even if rate increases are the primary tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. The global tightening of monetary policy is further adding to disinflationary pressure through an array of international trade and financial spillovers.
Our monetary policy tightening continues to be transmitted strongly to financing conditions and is increasingly affecting the broader economy.[2]The pass-through to bank funding costs has proceeded rapidly, most notably for yields on bank bonds. In addition to the impact of the policy rate hikes, the phasing out of the ECB’s TLTRO III has also raised bank funding costs. After an initial sluggish response, transmission to the remuneration of time deposits has been particularly strong in the euro area. High bank funding costs have passed through into a strong increase in lending rates to non-financial corporations and a tightening of credit standards, while loan volumes in the euro area have weakened sharply since the end of 2022.
Looking at the most recent data, lending rates for new business have further increased and credit volumes are continuing to contract. In particular, lending to firms and households is weak, amid higher bank funding costs and a tightening of credit standards. Substantial tightening is still expected to pass through in the coming months, as more fixed-rate loans expire and banks face rising funding costs as more savers migrate to term deposits and high-yield bank bonds. In line with the decrease in credit creation, the growth rate of M3 turned negative in July for the first time since 2010 and is expected to decline further to more negative levels in the coming months.
It is important to appreciate that the strong transmission of monetary policy tightening during this hiking cycle has not been at the cost of weakening the banking system. In particular, banks are currently benefiting from solid capital positions, resilient net interest income and contained credit risks. In turn, the robust state of the banking system can be linked to the relatively strong balance sheets of the household and corporate sectors, which were boosted by high savings rates and considerable fiscal transfers during the pandemic. Of course, close monitoring of the financial stability implications of our monetary policy continues to be an integral component in our policy-making process.
Last week’s interest rate decision
Based on our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, we raised the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at last week’s policy meeting in order to reinforce progress towards our two per cent medium-term inflation target. In particular, the deposit facility rate, which under conditions of ample liquidity is the policy rate that determines money market conditions, now stands at 4 per cent (400 basis points).
In explaining this decision, the incoming data have largely validated our previous assessment of the inflation outlook, while most measures of underlying inflation have started to ease. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that the transmission of our monetary policy to broader financing conditions and the real economy is firmly taking hold. The economic slowdown since the middle of 2022 is set to continue in the near term and the level of GDP will be considerably lower than we had previously expected. The resulting additional slack will further contribute to the disinflation process, while a significant portion of the tightening from our past rate hikes is still in the pipeline.
Drawing on the baseline staff projections, a range of model-based simulations suggest that a deposit facility rate of 400 basis points, so long as it is understood to be maintained for a sufficiently long duration, should be consistent with a return of inflation to target within the projection horizon. The views of external experts in our latest Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) were also clustered in the (375,400) interval in terms of a peak policy rate. This path for policy rates is also broadly reflected in market pricing of the forward rate curve.
In view of the uncertainty surrounding future inflation dynamics and the conditional, point-in-time nature of model-based simulations, expert surveys and market indicators, the choice between holding at 375 and moving to 400 was finely balanced. However, at the margin, it is safer to have decided on an additional hike rather than pause at 375 and “wait and see” whether an additional hike would be validated by the data flow between now and future meetings. In particular, the decision was motivated by the highly uncertain environment and the significant disinflation that is still required to return to our target in a timely manner.
The additional rate hike will reinforce progress towards our target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolves according to the staff projections baseline case, last week’s decision to hike bolsters confidence that inflation will return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher level of the interest rate will more strongly limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path, in view of the interaction dynamics between inflation shocks and the overall demand environment. It follows that, all else being equal, a more secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks will also reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, which remains a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.
Looking ahead
With last week’s decision, the key policy rates have been raised by a cumulative 450 basis points over the last ten meetings. Based on our current assessment (and cross-checked with external perspectives), our key policy rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.
At the same time, the high level of two-sided uncertainty around the baseline means that we will remain data dependent in determining the appropriate level and duration of restrictiveness in our monetary stance.
In assessing the inflation data over the coming months, base effects will play a significant role, making it unusually challenging to extract the underlying component from the reported data. In one direction, the very high energy-related price increases that occurred last Autumn will fall out of the annual inflation calculation, delivering declines in both headline and core inflation measures. In the other direction, many fiscal subsidies are scheduled to expire, which will raise reported inflation rates, especially in relation to 2024. The ongoing volatility in energy and food prices also adds to the noise-to-signal ratio in the inflation data, especially in view of the high uncertainty about the persistence and propagation of such shocks in the current environment. The noise-to-signal ratio is further elevated due to the lower reliability of standard seasonal adjustment techniques under current conditions.
Furthermore, standard indicators of underlying inflation require adjustments to strip out the impact of energy costs and supply bottlenecks on economy-wide prices, while the temporary contribution of pandemic reopening effects on the prices of contact-intensive services also distorts these indicators.[3]
Among the main open questions that the incoming data will need to answer will be the dynamics of wages and profits in the coming quarters. In particular, the disinflation embedded in the staff projections is built on a deceleration in wage growth, with the rate of increase in compensation per employee dropping from 5.3 per cent in 2023 to 4.3 per cent in 2024 and 3.8 per cent in 2025. These projected rates of wage increases are sufficient to restore the pre-pandemic level of real wages within the projection horizon, with the rates of wage inflation in 2024 and 2025 well ahead of the rates of price inflation. It will be well into the new year before the area-wide 2024 wage trends become fully visible: this fundamental source of uncertainty will not be resolved any time soon. In turn, the next phase in wage adjustment will also depend on the extent to which labour demand is affected by the slowdown in economic activity. In particular, the dampening of activity levels and the increase in financing costs might lower the propensity to hoard labour.
The contribution of unit profits to annual inflation in the first half of 2023 has moderated relative to its contribution in 2022, suggesting that the rising wage pressures are starting to be absorbed by firms. Price hikes coming in below the increase in unit labour costs are projected to contribute further to the required disinflation during 2024. In parallel to the drawn-out nature of the wage adjustment process, the actual contribution of profit moderation to disinflation will only be uncovered over a number of quarters.
In terms of the policy response, our restrictive monetary policy stance is providing considerable support to the required disinflation dynamics. In particular, the stagnation of activity levels during 2023 and the associated higher level of slack in the economy means that firms will be more cautious in seeking outsized price hikes and more reluctant to grant excessive wage increases. In related fashion, any new cost-push shocks are less likely to be amplified under demand-constrained conditions, with such shocks more likely to dent the real value of both profits and wages, rather than being fully passed through to consumer prices. At the same time, we will continue to monitor the strength of monetary policy transmission, in view of the state-contingent impact of monetary policy tightening on financing conditions, the real economy and inflation dynamics.
These considerations suggest that we still have ahead of us an extended phase of uncertainty about the disinflation process. Given the scale of the initial inflation shock, the lagged nature of wage adjustment in the euro area, the considerable sectoral rebalancing that is underway and the extent of uncertainty about transmission lags and the strength of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, it is hardly surprising that inflation uncertainty will not be quickly resolved."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Mediterranean Meetings
Marseille, 21 September 2023
I am honoured to be with you at the Palais du Pharo, overlooking the historic port of Marseille, the cradle of today’s eponymous city.
For thousands of years, this port has served as the city’s spiritual and economic heart, acting as its gateway to the world. Even today, this city still embodies the essence of the Mediterranean: a site with a shared history, a bridge connecting the diverse peoples of its shores and a place compelled by its very nature to open itself up to the world.
It is in this spirit that you have gathered here for the Mediterranean Meetings – to consider the region’s calling and destiny and to offer unity and peace in a landscape marked by global division, inequality and instability.
In that same spirit, I would like to divide my speech today into three distinct parts.
First, I will recall the rich history of the Mediterranean region and the deep roots shared by all those who inhabit its shores. Second, I will look at some of the challenges the region is facing today. Lastly, I will reflect on how we can foster the region’s economic reintegration and reclaim its unity and strength in a new era.
The Mediterranean region: past and present
For a long time, the Mediterranean remained a “mare clausum”, an impregnable sea that served as a natural barrier for its people.
From Homer to Horace, the Mediterranean was a source of both fear and fascination.
But over thousands of years, through intrepid seafaring and humans’ innate desire to go beyond the horizon, the Mediterranean was turned from a barrier into a bridge, binding the different parts of the region together into a cohesive whole.
The Phoenicians were the first to develop the sea’s potential. They revolutionised maritime technology through innovation, inventing the keel,[1]endowing their vessels with greater speed and allowing new sea routes to open up.[2]
What the Phoenicians began the Greeks continued, setting up city states along the Mediterranean’s shores, including the one we are meeting in today.
But the region’s integration took another crucial step when Rome became the pre-eminent power.
Supported by the Pax Romana, a common currency and an integrated legal framework, the scale, reach and intensity of commerce within the region reached its peak.[3]This laid the foundations for something akin to a Mediterranean single market, where goods, people, but also cultures and religions, flowed freely.
This history underscores how much we are collectively shaped by the history of the Mediterranean region. For thousands of years, the people of its shores saw each other as their closest neighbours – our economies and societies rose and fell together.
But this is not the Mediterranean we see today.
It is now a mosaic of distinct regions and countries spanning southern Europe, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, with low levels of trade and cultural exchange.
Rather than being an economic centre, it has been pulled in different directions fundamentally reshaping centuries-old trade patterns.
As a result, intra-Mediterranean trade today accounts for less than one-third of the region’s foreign trade. Furthermore, trade between southern Mediterranean countries accounts for a mere 5%, marking one of the lowest levels of regional economic integration in the world.[4]
The shared challenges of today
Yet even if the countries of the contemporary Mediterranean have drifted apart, they face an array of common challenges.
I see two main shared challenges for the region today – what I refer to as restoring the economic balance and the natural balance.
First comes restoring the economic balance.
The Mediterranean today is off balance in the sense that we are seeinglarge, persistent economic disparities.
Those disparities exist between countries. Those along the northern shore that are part of the EU boasted a per capita GDP of over USD 40,000 in 2019, more than twice that of the countries on the southern shore, at less than USD 19,000.[5]In addition, they attract more than two-thirds of net inflows of foreign direct investment into the region.[6]
Disparities also exist within countries – in the form of inequality – although to do justice to this topic would require another speech.
These disparities also exist between generations: the Mediterranean boasts one of the world’s youngest populations, with nearly one in every three people under the age of 25. In the southern and eastern Mediterranean, nearly half of the population falls into this category.[7]
Youth unemployment rates in the southern and eastern Mediterranean were among the highest globally in 2019, ranging from a minimum of 19% in Tunisia to a maximum of 42% in Algeria. Equally concerning is the participation rate of women in the region’s job market, one of the lowest rates in the world at only 22% in 2019.[8]
This demographic divide is projected to widen. While the population on the northern shores is expected to drop by over 4%, the southern and eastern shores are expected to see an increase of more than 20% by 2050.[9]
At the same time, countries in the western Mediterranean in particular, including Algeria, France, Italy, Morocco, Spain and Tunisia, have some of the highest levels of university enrolment.[10]But a substantial number of university graduates still grapple with unemployment, which exceeds 30% in many southern Mediterranean countries. There is in fact a paradoxical trend where higher levels of education seem to correlate withhigherrates of unemployment.[11]
The consequences of these problems are not confined to the less affluent parts of the region. Lack of opportunity leads to the loss of countless lives, as migrants strive to reach the more prosperous northern shores. And the countries where those migrants arrive are faced with anger, division and pressure on their social systems.
For the good of the entire region, we must therefore strive to restore economic balance. This means ensuring that the region’s youth can integrate with confidence, instead of becoming unwitting and unwilling contributors to the proliferation of instability and conflict or the perpetuation of migrant flows.
Yet restoring the economic balance is not enough. The structure of the economy affects both people and the planet, therefore economic questions cannot be considered in isolation from the natural environment.
Indeed, the economic balance will be made immeasurably worse if we fail to restore the natural balance in parallel. Most importantly, this means addressing the Mediterranean region’s vulnerability to climate change.
This pressing issue was highlighted by Pope Francis in his encyclical, Laudato Si,[12]in which he called on humanity to protect and respect an integral ecology.
The effects of our failure to heed this call are already becoming visible.
The Mediterranean basin is witnessing some alarming trends, with temperatures rising 20% above the global average. And it places approximately 250 million people on a trajectory to being classified as “water poor” within the next two decades.[13]
If current policies remain unchanged, temperatures in the region are expected to surge to a level 2.2ºC higher than pre-industrial levels by 2040.[14]
Stressed ecosystems and increased pollution pose major risks to our economies and our lives. And they disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including elderly people, children, and those on low incomes.
The recent drought in the western Mediterranean, for example, has illustrated just how devastating the consequences of climate change could be. In Morocco, cumulative rainfall in the period prior to the sowing of winter crops was 50-80% below the long-term average, leaving farmers facing the worst drought in 30 years.[15]
And the combination of ever scarcer resources, ever higher migration flows and ever worse conflicts is likely to exacerbate the situation. As we saw in 2011, when rising food prices triggered the Arab Spring in Tunisia, we can expect profound political upheaval as well.
This only serves to underscore how, when we disregard the natural balance, we disturb the balance of our societies too.
So, we urgently need to restore and respect this natural balance. And we need to recognise that this is intimately linked to our ability to deliver justice for young people and for those most in need, and in turn to ensure the harmony of our societies.
Reintegrating the region for the common good
How can we restore this balance?
We cannot seek answers by searching on our own, which would only exacerbate divisions and inequalities. As these challenges transcend borders, the only way to restore balance is by addressing them together.
This is a matter of reconnecting with the deep roots of this region and of rediscovering a sense of the common good.
Achieving the common good implies that each part of society must be able to reach fulfilment more fully and easily. In other words, the good of society as a whole ultimately depends on the well-being of each individual part.
For the Mediterranean region, there are two practical dimensions to achieving the common good in the current era.
The first is recognising that there is more that unites our societies than divides them.
The world has entered a geopolitical era marked by profound changes in international relations. We are seeing greater competition among great powers, a waning respect for international rules and the declining influence of multilateral institutions.
In this new landscape ethical foundations and trustworthiness are once again becoming more important in evaluating political and economic partnerships. Across the world, we are seeing countries forging closer ties based on trust and shared interests – a process known as nearshoring or friend-shoring.
For instance, since Russia’s unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, trade among geopolitical allies has grown by 4-6% more than trade between geopolitical adversaries, which is unusual in such a short period of time.[16]
These transformations offer an opportunity to recognise what we have in common and to considerably strengthen connections in the region. The Mediterranean, with its geographical proximity, industrial potential and young workforce, is poised to become an attractive hub for nearshoring, especially for firms wanting to be closer to Europe.
This could significantly bolster economic ties throughout the region – a potential that is visible in areas that are capitalising on their position. Commercial zones like Tanger Med, the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the Mersin Free Zone in Türkiye have already managed to become a key part of sophisticated industrial supply chains.[17]
For example, 11 of the world’s top 20 car companies are now based at Tanger Med’s industrial platform. Its port in Morocco handled almost half a million finished vehicles in 2022, an 11% increase on the previous year. And Morocco will soon manufacture the first 100% African-designed electric car.
By further exploiting the new geography of trade – shaped by common values and mutual trust – the entire region can build on these successes. And by doing so, we can reduce inequality not only between countries, but also between generations. In a world where supply chains are shortening, the young and educated population of the Mediterranean could become one of the region’s most valuable assets.
This requires investment in skills, infrastructure and stability.
The region needs targeted education policies geared towards developing the skills needed in sectors that are set to grow. In particular, given their growing significance in shaping the future employment landscape, basic digital skills could play a pivotal role in creating job opportunities for the unemployed or disengaged young people. These tailored policies must also emphasise the inclusion of girls and women within our economies, thereby fostering a more just and equitable society.
The integration of efficient supply chains across the region will also require substantial investment in infrastructure, namely ports, railways and industrial bases. According to the World Bank, investments totalling at least USD 100 billion per year over the next decade will be needed to maintain and upgrade the infrastructure in the region.[18]
In a world where new trade barriers are appearing by the minute, it is in the interests of all countries in the region to bind their destinies together. And turning Mediterranean neighbours into partners offers a route tosharedprosperity
A prerequisite for this to happen is economic stability, especially price stability. High inflation is a challenge for the whole region today. It needs to be brought down, not least because low and stable inflation is key to encouraging long-term investment. Investing in major infrastructure projects takes many years, and this will be discouraged if people expect costs to spiral upwards during construction and make those projects unprofitable.
For our part, at the ECB we are committed to maintaining price stability for the euro area. That is why since July last year we have raised interest rates ten times, and why we acted again last week to reinforce progress towards our inflation target.
The second dimension to advancing the common good is to share the endowments of the region in a more sustainable way.
Today, two developments offer new hope in this area.
First, the Paris Agreement, to which all Mediterranean countries[19]are signatories, set a clear path towards carbon neutrality. This means we have to speed up the transition from polluting energy sources to clean ones.
Second, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been a painful reminder of Europe’s energy dependency. Bolstering energy security is now a priority, and this calls for diversifying energy imports as well as investing more in renewable technologies.
The Mediterranean region is perfectly placed to benefit from this opening, as it can play a crucial role as both a source of secure supply and a provider of renewable energy. And by sharing its endowments in this way, the region can strengthen the connection between its southern and northern shores and protect the climate from excessive heating.
In the short to medium term, establishing a Mediterranean gas hub to diversify energy suppliers and routes will be key. The region boasts substantial gas resources, as well as emerging gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean. All of this makes it well placed to become a major artery in the supply of energy.[20]
Looking further ahead, the transition to renewable energy should be closely intertwined with the development of clean energy production across the Mediterranean. The region is endowed with considerable solar and wind energy, as well as hydrogen.
Installing power systems such as concentrated solar power plants could potentially generate electricity equivalent to 100 times the combined consumption of the Mediterranean and Europe.[21]North African suppliers are also expected to play a central role in providing the region with low-carbon hydrogen.[22]
Seizing this opportunity to share the region’s natural resources – and thereby combine destinies – could be transformative in so many ways.
It would bring energy security to the Mediterranean’s northern shores while fostering growth and inclusion on its southern shores. It would endow young people with the skills, especially in green and digital sectors, that are necessary for a just and equitable society. And it would help all of us to meet the challenge of our times: halting the warming of the planet.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In the late fourth century BC, a daring young man from Marseille named Pytheas embarked on an extensive journey.
It took him north-west, across the Straits of Gibraltar to the mysterious island of Thule and beyond. Pytheas would become known as the first scientist to describe the wonders of the Arctic, from the Northern Lights to the perpetual snow.
His story exemplifies a way of life based on curiosity and a burning desire to unravel the mysteries of the world. There is no doubt that he shared this inquisitive nature with the pioneering Phoenician seafarers who came before him.
Their curiosity helped to open up the Mediterranean to its people, which in turn laid the foundations for the extraordinary exchange of goods, cultures and religions on which numerous great civilisations were founded.
Today, the Mediterranean may have lost some of its former character. But it has not forgotten its roots, nor has its potential been dimmed.
This can serve as the basis for renewing a sense of shared purpose, helping to drive the region’s economic reintegration and repair its social fabric.
And it can help us forge closer bonds that will ultimately heal the divisions and inequalities that we cannot, in good conscience, tolerate in a just society. Each of us where we can contribute."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Springtij Forum
Terschelling, 20 September 2023
“From here, if you drive east, or better yet if you cycle east past Hee, Kaart, Baaiduinen, Midsland, Landerum, Formerum, Lies and Hoorn, on after Hoorn you arrive on a road to the end of the world. The end of the world? Not quite. First past that last little village. And then Siberia begins, as Wouter van Dieren wrote in a poem. That last village’s name is – fittingly – Oosterend: East end.
I first made that journey forty-five years ago. With my parents and my two sisters. To Oosterend. The second farm on the right. That’s where we stopped. That’s where we stayed. Summer after summer. And a part of me has stayed there forever. Just a part? No, that’s where I became a native of this island: a Terschellinger.
[…]
Inside, next to the dining table hung a long poster, in a white glass frame. That poster must have been hanging there for a very long time. Because the colours were already faded and yellowed with age. It showed the protected flowers of Terschelling.Parnassia, the heath spotted-orchid, the marsh helleborine, the lesser butterfly orchid, the round-leaved wintergreen, the blue sea thistle, the beach morning glory, the sundew and the blue marsh gentian.”
I spoke these words – these exact words – five years ago almost to the day in the Tonnenloods, just a few hundred metres away from behind this same, solid, timeless, dependable, driftwood lectern.Has then everything, like this lectern supporting both “vrydom”[1]and me, stayed the same? Has nothing changed? Were these years windless, without ebb, without flow?
On the contrary. They were years of great flux. “Full of sound and fury”, as Shakespeare wrote. They were years of setbacks and progress. Disaster and perspective. Disappointment and vision. Despair and hope. Ebb and flow.
Today I’d like to tell you the story of these five years. For inspiration, motivation and as a call to action. As an overture to what admittedly will be no comedy, yet should certainly not become a requiem. I’ll also tell you the story of the next five years, and the next fifty. But first the story of the last five, the story of the yellow rattle and the eyebright.
I have made that same journey to Oosterend for decades now, with my wife and children, too. Just five weeks ago. I was cycling to the Boschplaat. With picture perfect memories of the faded poster in my head. And there they were. Proud, stately, chic, jaunty: the tussocks of marble-white, veined parnassia. And where parnassia grows, rattles and eyebright won’t be far away. And so it was. The rattle had finished blooming. Which is when it truly lives up to its name. If you shake it softly, close to your ear, you’ll hear a rattle.
I got off my bike and knelt down. Like the little boy from the era of the yellowed poster. I listened. I tried to listen. But I couldn’t anymore. I knew too much.
What I heard was not a soft rattle. And I heard not one, but one thousand rattles, not rattling softly, but with a deafening clatter and clamour, sounding the alarm. All the rattles from the Boschplaat to Koegelwieck to Noordsvaarder, all the rattles along the Dutch coast, along all coasts, big and small, erupting in a chilling Verdian Dies Irae like the terrible Scream by Munch.[2]
A selection of headlines from recent weeks.
“Thousands of penguin chicks die in Antarctic ice breakup”[3]
“Climate change causes Indonesian rice paddies to dry up”[4]
“Global emissions of ... nitrous oxide ... are rising. This greenhouse gas, at least 250 times stronger than CO2, is already contributing nearly 10 percent of global warming”[5]
“Greek firefighters battle the same fire for two weeks already”[6]
“Fossil fuel subsidies to private sector cost the government EUR 37.5 billion each year”[7]
“Fossil fuel industry receives more subsidies than anticipated: EUR 40 to 46 billion”[8]
“Biodiversity body warns of $423bn annual hit from ‘invasive alien species’”[9]
“One invasive aquatic plant can kill off entire ecosystem”[10]
“European Central Bank flags stark economic risks from biodiversity loss”[11]
“Water in the Rhine is still too dirty. […] Excessive concentrations of over sixty substances”[12]
“This summer is by far the hottest on record worldwide”[13]
“World heat records ‘smashed’ in northern hemisphere summer, scientists say. ‘Season of simmering’ in planet’s warmest June to August period since documentation began in 1940”[14]
“Canada’s emissions from wildfires more than double previous record”[15]
“Extreme flooding caused by Storm Daniel devastates Greece”[16]
“Libya floods: Death toll rises to 11,300 in Derna”[17]
“At least five thousand dead in eastern Libya due to Storm Daniel: ‘bodies are everywhere’”[18]
“UN concerned about growing demand for sand from beaches: nature in the North Sea affected for years”[19]
“World way off track to meet Paris climate goals, says UN report”[20]
“European Central Bank and OECD view slow climate policy with dismay”[21]
This is what five weeks ago, when I knelt down next to my bike on the Boschplaat, the rattle was drumming into my ear like a deranged timpanist, accompanied by brass in unison – tubas, trombones and trumpets – blaring in my ears like the final frenetic, dissonant closing chords – sucking all the air from the room, breath-taking and haunting –of a symphony of the last of days.
If you set aside the emotions of the headlines, and just follow the science, relying on the latest insights from the world’s top research institutes, going on hard facts alone, – and here, careful listeners will suspect these are the words of a central banker – putting your ear not next to a rattle, but to scientific discipline,you hear the following.
According to last month’s measurements, the long-term average global temperature is 1.23 degrees Celsius higher than before the industrial revolution, more than a tenth of a degree closer to the critical one-and-a-half-degree limit of the Paris Agreement than it was when I spoke here five years ago.[22]
And the outlook is deteriorating. If in 2018 you extrapolated the trend in average rising global temperatures, you would have seen us passing the one-and-a-half-degree Celsius increase above pre-industrial levels by 2037. Extrapolating that trend now, we will already get there by 2034.[23]In some parts of the world, the situation is even more serious. In Europe, average temperatures have already risen by more than two degrees Celsius. The long-term average increase in Arctic temperatures has even reached three degrees above pre-industrial levels.[24]
The lockdowns during the pandemic may have significantly lowered additional CO2 emissions for a while, but they had no discernible impact on existing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere.[25]This is higher than it ever has been in the last two million years, and it is continuing to rise.[26]
Heatwaves and widespread droughts have led to worryingly low groundwater and river levels throughout Europe.[27][28]
The flooding in Germany and in Belgium in 2021 was the most costly natural disaster in Europe since records began in 1980.[29]
In the EU, just one quarter of the potential damage from climate disasters is insured.[30]
We see that extreme heatwaves like the one that affected Europe in 2022 have an impact on food inflation.[31]
Biodiversity and ecosystems are under increasing stress. Of the eight million species of plants and animals, one million are threatened with extinction.[32]And this while 72% of euro area firms depend on one or more ecosystem services.[33]
Despite all this, last summer the ministers responsible for climate and nature from the twenty largest economies still failed to reach agreement on reducing fossil fuel use and developing sustainable energy.
What is more, in 2022 global subsidies for fossil fuels reached record levels as a result of policy measures in response to the energy crisis.[34]
In 2023 current policy implies that the median rise in temperature will reach 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels at the end of this century, far in excess of the critical Paris Agreement targets.[35]
These are the cold, hard facts of the last five years. Fully in line with the warnings from science  unequivocal warnings, going back decades, but all too often thrown to the wind.
Deafened by the yellow rattle, numbed by the science: what’s left for us other than depression and lethargy? Are we finally giving up? Are we walking away in despair? Are we finished here? And, once we give up, will we indulge in one very last unbridled, greenhouse gas-pumping, biodiversity-destroying, orgy of unsustainability – “Après moi, le déluge!”?
“There would have been a time for such a word”, as Shakespeare wrote, “but no longer!”, we now know.
“One need not hope in order to undertake, nor succeed in order to persevere”[36], as William of Orange is believed to have said.
Need not hope to undertake. Need not succeed to persevere. What can’t we achieve, when a solid start has already been made? What’s holding us back, when what’s been achieved so far offers undeniable hope?
Because a start has been made. More than a start. Much more. And there is reason to hope.
Let’s forget the headlines for a moment. Allow me to take you with me to the world of legislation and regulation. And to the world of central bankers and supervisors. The world of complex acronyms and big bucks. At first glance an abstract one, but not a different world: mine, but also your world. Our world.
As I said standing behind this lectern five years ago: the Brandaris lighthouse on Terschelling now shines its light from the engine room to the bridge of the financial system. It no longer serves only “As a warning to all seafarers” (as inscribed on the stone plaque on the north side of the lighthouse), but also as a beacon for those who have to navigate the treacherous currents and shallows of the financial waters.
From the ECB towers in Frankfurt, what do we see revealed in the light from this beacon of hope and safe harbour that shines from Terschelling? What does the light from this beacon of hope and reassurance reveal?
In 2018 policy pledges by governments put us on a path to three degrees of warming by the end of the century.[37]Since then policy pledges have brought that down to two degrees.[38]In an optimistic scenario where all pledges are fulfilled, even one-and-a-half degrees is achievable – just about.[39]
In Europe there has since been a Climate Act, a Green Deal and a fit-for-55 package.
In response to the pandemic, a European recovery programme was agreed, with mutual debt issuance to support the green transition.
The European Parliament recently passed the European Nature Restoration Law, a crucial element of the European Union’s biodiversity strategy.
The alphabet soup of specific European legislation and regulation is becoming richer and richer. There is the CSRD – the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, requiring firms to report on their environmental impact. And then there is the CSDDD – the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which will hold firms responsible for their negative impact on people and the environment. Meanwhile, the importance of transition planning is explicitly acknowledged in the proposed revisions to the CRR and CRD – the Capital Requirements Regulation and Capital Requirements Directive that regulate banks.
And it is not just the legislators, but also central banks and supervisors who have made significant progress. In 2018 the members of theCentral Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial Systemnumbered less than 20.Today there are 127 members from all over the world. All these central banks and supervisors concur that the climate and ecological crises are a source of financial risk and so fall squarely within their mandates.
This conclusion has consequences. It means that those central banks and supervisors that continue to neglect these crises fail to fulfil their mandates. The European Central Bank has given substance to this insight, in both its monetary and its supervisory tasks. In 2021, under the leadership of President Lagarde and with the agreement of all the central bank governors and presidents of the euro area countries, we adopted a new strategy. This strategy explicitly recognises the importance of the climate crisis for our monetary policy. It is linked to an action plan with concrete steps to align our policy with the Paris goals.
In 2020 we published our supervisory expectations for how banks should manage their climate and environmental risks. By the end of 2024 all banks under our supervision must fulfil these expectations, and we have also set intermediate deadlines. We stand ready to enforce these deadlines with all the instruments at our disposal, including imposing periodic penalty payments.
As well as the legislators and central banks, investors are also playing their part: research shows they are willing to accept lower returns from certified green investments.[40]
As I have just summed up, the last few years have not just been years of setbacks, disasters, disappointment and despair. They haven’t just been years of the rattle. They have also been years of progress, perspective, vision and hope.
Five weeks ago on the Boschplaat, the eyebright was flowering in abundance. Living up to what its name promises. It offered hope. The hope that what must be done, can be done. But although there is this hope, it does not necessarily follow that we will actually do what must be done.
So far we are doing too little. And what we are doing, we’re doing too slowly. As was also the conclusion of the United Nations’ first global stocktake of the Paris Agreement.[41]We have to pull out all the stops. This requires us all to make an effort. A supreme effort. A supreme and most urgent effort. All of us.
And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. Those who make the rules and those who have to follow them. Those who pollute. Those who finance the polluters. And those who supervise the financiers of the polluters.
And I’m not saying this because of a political preference. I’m saying this as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, which earlier this month published a study showing again that the costs of delaying are substantially higher than the costs of a timely transition.[42]
There is no limit to what we can all contribute. All of you, by being here on Terschelling and in your various roles once you are back on the mainland. From the smallest start-up to the biggest multinational. Voters and leaders. The National Opera, by dedicating an opera to the climate crisis.[43]The children’s author who is tackling the climate and nature crises in her upcoming book. Those preparing the curriculums for our schools and universities. And the parents introducing their children to the protected plants of Terschelling.
Some people say: more haste, less speed, it’s not 2030 yet, it’s not 2050 yet, there’s still time, it’s not too late.
To them I reply: it was too late for those nameless refugees whose charred remains were found in the gutted forests of Greece. It was too late for the thousands of victims of Storm Daniel in eastern Libya.[44]And it will be too late for the victims of the hurricanes, droughts, forest fires and floods that come next year and in the following years. There’s no time to lose.
Those who call for delaying the transition to protect the most vulnerable among us will notice that the strongest shoulders, not the weakest, can hold out longest against the destructive consequences of the climate and ecological crises. The transition will either be just, or it won’t happen at all. No transition, or a transition that comes too late, would be the greatest injustice of all. Delay is no solution. Delay is expensive. Delay is disastrous.
Once more I invite you to step back five years in time with me. I ended by calling on you to save these plants, for our children and our children’s children: the parnassia, the heath spotted orchid, the marsh helleborine, the lesser butterfly orchid, round-leaved wintergreen, the blue sea thistle, the beach morning glory, sundews and the blue marsh gentian. Because the long poster on the wall behind the dining table of the second farm on the right in Oosterend may be faded and yellowed with age, but we don’t have to give up. We can’t allow ourselves to give up. We don’t want to give up. And we won’t give up.
Dear participants, it must be done.Friends, it can be done."

Opening remarks by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the joint workshop of European independent fiscal institutions and the European System of Central Banks on “European fiscal policy and governance reform in uncertain times”
Frankfurt am Main, 20 September 2023
Our fiscal framework is at a crossroads.[1]Negotiations on the European Commission’s legislative proposals for reform of the EU’s economic governance rules are entering a crucial phase.
To ensure this reform is successful and that it strengthens our economic governance, the new framework will have to protect us from the mistakes of the past. And it will need to make it possible to use again policies that have proven to be effective.
Before the pandemic, we had accumulated a significant public investment gap that had undermined our economic potential.[2]Fiscal policy had often been procyclical. And macroeconomic policies had at times worked against each other. We have paid a high price for this in the form of weaker growth, higher unemployment and deteriorating fiscal conditions.
But the response to the pandemic was different. National fiscal policies responded countercyclically to the downturn, complemented by a European stimulus plan which focused on investments in the green transition and digitalisation. This fiscal response worked in tandem with monetary policy and supervisory measures, mitigating financial amplification effects and pulling the economy out of the liquidity trap.[3]The result has been an almost full recovery (Chart 1), record-low unemployment and the return of debt to a downwards path after the initial increase recorded in 2020.
More recently, fiscal policy has complemented monetary policy to counter the inflationary effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine and the energy crisis.
Today I will argue that we need to embed the lessons learned from this experience in our fiscal governance.
Ensuring the sustainability of public finances is like balancing a seesaw, with debt on one side and growth on the other. To achieve a true balance, fiscal policy must be countercyclical, consistent with price stability and supportive of potential growth. It must also be based on measures that are both economically sound and politically sustainable. This means not only ensuring that fiscal policy is based on rigorous technical analysis – where independent fiscal institutions (IFIs) have an important role to play – but also that it has broad political support and is democratically accountable.
I will argue that this balance must be based on three elements.
First, I will emphasise the importance of complementarity between monetary and fiscal policies and the fact that the nature of their interactions depends on the state of the economy. In times of stress, a combination of unconventional fiscal and monetary policies may well prove to be the best course of action.
I will then argue for a fiscal framework which takes into account the importance of both debt and economic growth for the sustainability of public finances. We need an integrated approach that delivers the right mix of fiscal prudence, smart public investments and structural reforms.
Finally, I will focus on two key aspects of the debate for reforming European fiscal governance: the role of IFIs and the missing elements of this reform. We need to strengthen the “E” in EMU, our Economic and Monetary Union. This cannot be achieved without a well-coordinated fiscal stance and a permanent central fiscal capacity in the euro area.
Ensuring complementarity between fiscal policy and monetary policy
Let me begin by stressing the importance of the interaction between fiscal policy and monetary policy. The nature of this interaction depends on the state of the economy.
Since 2020, in just three and a half years, there have beenfour identifiable distinct phases.
In the first one, fiscal policy and monetary policies worked in tandem to support our economies in response to the shock caused by the pandemic, which had resulted in sudden disruptions on both the demand and the supply side. National fiscal policies were strongly expansionary, introducing measures such as short-time work schemes, to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. At the same time, monetary policy ensured that favourable financing conditions were maintained to safeguard the transmission of monetary policy. Non-standard monetary and fiscal measures, such as the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme and the EU’s Next Generation EU programme, played a central role in restoring confidence, especially in vulnerable euro area economies.
In a second and shorter phase, after the summer of 2021 the focus shifted to ensuring the correct sequencing of policy normalisation after the pandemic. In European fora, it was argued that fiscal normalisation should come first, albeit in a gradual and growth-friendly manner. This would have put the economy on a trajectory that would also have allowed for the gradual normalisation of monetary policy, thereby fostering a balanced and sustainable recovery.
However, Russia’s aggression of Ukraine and manipulation of energy supplies[4]dramatically changed the economic landscape once again, leading tothe third phase. Given the sharp rise in energy prices and the emergence of supply bottlenecks, inflation unexpectedly rose to levels not seen since the early 1980s and economic growth forecasts fell. This triggered a different response from monetary and fiscal authorities.
The striking aspect of this phase was the unconventional nature of the fiscal measures adopted. While the ECB intensified its efforts to fight inflation, euro area countries implemented temporary fiscal measures to alleviate the burden of high energy prices (Chart 2). More than half of these measures had a direct negative impact on the cost of energy consumption. This helped to contain inflation, and thus contributed to wage moderation. The remaining measures supported household and corporate incomes in ways that were often insufficiently targeted at the most vulnerable ones.
In this phase, the ECB avoided unwarranted increases in sovereign spreads through its decision to introduce the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) in July 2022. The TPI allowed the ECB to adjust its monetary stance quickly without causing financial fragmentation, which would have hampered the effective transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. The TPI also enhanced the ability of Member States, particularly those with high debt ratios, to counteract the energy shock.[5]
ECB staff simulations suggest that unconventional fiscal policies (UFPs) contributed to containing inflation by 0.9 percentage points over the period 2022-23 (Chart 3).[6]Additional estimates based on microsimulation models[7]indicate that the impact of these measures may have been even larger – inflation up to 1.6 percentage points lower for the euro area in 2022 alone.[8]Importantly, UFPs have helped to avoid second-round effects and keep long-term inflation expectations anchored, thereby supporting monetary policy in reducing euro area inflation from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 5.2% today.[9]UFPs have also helped to maintain a balanced economic environment[10]and stabilise the European economy.[11]
As we navigate our way through 2023, the fall in energy prices has created new policy challenges, representingthe fourth phase. During this phase it has become necessary to withdraw fiscal energy support measures in a timely manner. Failure to do so could create a demand impulse that would exacerbate inflationary pressures, which would in turn trigger a monetary policy response. This would be highly inefficient, akin to giving with one hand and taking away with the other.[12]
The recent interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy provide two important lessons. First, monetary policy and fiscal policies can and should work together when necessary, such as in response to large shocks. In recent years this has been essential to underpin economic resilience, bolster the recovery and fight inflation.
Indeed, price stability and fiscal sustainability support each other. Prudent fiscal policies in good times create the necessary space for fiscal policy to support demand alongside monetary policy during economic downturns. At the same time, a genuinely anti-inflationary monetary policy and price stability are necessary to maintain the sustainability of public finances. In fact, in the decade before the pandemic, low inflation allowed European countries to continue to borrow at low cost, even though their debt ratios rose sharply. This changed with the onset of the adverse global supply shocks, which pushed up both inflation and financing costs (Chart 4).
For this interaction to work effectively in the future, we need to ensure that the euro area’s fiscal stance is not simply an incidental outcome of national fiscal policies. Instead, it should be achieved through the effective coordination of Member States’ fiscal policies under the guidance of the European Commission and with an enhanced role for the European Fiscal Board during the assessment phase.
The second lesson is that the monetary-fiscal interaction should not follow rigid, predetermined rules. Both the economic literature and the experience of policymaking suggest that this interaction should depend on the state of the economy, which can only be taken into account by introducing sufficient flexibility into our fiscal governance. This is the case, for example, when we allow escape clauses that temporarily freeze the implementation of European fiscal rules to be activated in exceptional circumstances.
What does this mean in practice for macroeconomic stabilisation in EMU?
Under normal economic conditions, countercyclical fiscal policy should continue to rely primarily on national automatic stabilisers, especially in the euro area, where they are widely used.[13]This reflects the fact that automatic stabilisers are better suited than discretionary measures to respond to the normal fluctuations of the business cycle because of their timeliness, predictability, proper targeting and sustainability.[14]
But this is not the whole story. In exceptional circumstances – when “tail events” occur – countercyclical discretionary fiscal measures play an important role in the presence of low inflation traps or inflationary spirals, thereby supporting price stability without infringing on central bank independence.[15]
The different fiscal policies followed in the euro area during past crises are a good illustration of this point. During the great financial crisis and the pandemic, fiscal policy across the EU had a decisive countercyclical effect, bringing the cyclically adjusted primary balance to adeficitof around 2% of euro area GDP (Chart 5). This response limited the severity of the downturn and helped the economy to recover. The sovereign debt crisis of 2012-13 provides a counterexample. Fiscal policy at the time was procyclical. The cyclically adjusted primarysurplusrose to around 2% of GDP, deepening and prolonging the recession. The tightening was particularly strong in the most stressed euro area economies, which experienced significant output losses.
Ongoing review of the fiscal governance framework
What does all this mean for the fiscal governance framework?
Above all, the fiscal framework must reflect the fact that the sustainability of public finances depends on both the numerator and the denominator of the debt-to-GDP ratio. We need to pay close attention to debt dynamics, but this would be useless without growth.
In my view,the fiscal framework should havefour main characteristics.
First, it must providefor arealistic, gradual and sustained adjustment of public debt ratiosin order to strengthen sustainability and rebuild fiscal space ahead of future downturns. This has become even more crucial since the pandemic, which led to higher and more heterogeneous debt ratios across countries.
Second, fiscal policy should begenuinelycountercyclical, both in responding to adverse economic shocks and in rebuilding buffers once the economy is back on track.
Third, the proposed framework should ensure thatMember States can formulate their own strategiesto achieve the objectives of reducing debt and deficits. And to facilitate effective implementation, it should be simple and provide robust, stable growth projections.
Any common safeguards aimed at striking the right balance between a country-by-country approach and common quantitative benchmarks should not undermine the proposed rationale of the framework or add undue complexity. We need to move away from a “one-size-fits-all” strategy to strengthen ownership and accountability at the national level.
Finally, effective fiscal governance should support the EU’s growth potential.The pursuit of fiscal sustainability should be accompanied by adequate incentives for investment and reform in order to strengthen our Union and prepare it for the future.
We must not sacrifice much-needed investment, which has been too low for too long,[17]with detrimental longer-term effects. This has also been a by-product of a fiscal framework that was not designed to protect investment, where fiscal consolidation was often pursued by cutting public investment.[18]Even in highly efficient economies, low public investment and the associated private investment gap have eroded competitiveness over time, jeopardising future growth.[19]
A comprehensive approach that integrates these elements promises to be both economically viable and politically palatable. And, as I will argue, it could also shape the evolution of our fiscal framework after the current economic governance review has been concluded, as we transition out of the Next Generation EU programme.
In my view, the Commission’s proposals balance these four essential components of optimal fiscal governance when compared with the previous rules.
The ECB expressed its support for the legislative package in an official opinion published in July this year.[20]We made specific, technical suggestions to refine the new framework. A sound, transparent and credible new fiscal governance will be crucial to anchor market expectations for debt sustainability and sustainable, inclusive growth.
Let me now turn to two specific aspects of the ECB’s opinion.
Role of independent fiscal institutions in EU fiscal governance
I would like to start with the role of national IFIs, whose work is generally recognised as having a positive impact on fiscal policy (Figure 1).
Overall, the ECB supports the proposal to strengthen the role of IFIs in the fiscal framework (Figure 2). While fiscal policy is the prerogative of democratically elected governments and cannot be delegated to technical institutions, it should still be based on sound economic analysis.
This is primarily the role of IFIs, which can contribute significantly to improving fiscal governance in the EU.[22]In particular, IFIs can help to improve the quality of public spending and facilitate its reallocation to investment projects.
The ECB has expressed support for the Commission’s proposals on IFIs. We welcome the inclusion of the “comply-or-explain” principle in the legislation and agree that IFIs should have adequate own resources to carry out their mandates effectively.
The contribution of IFIs could be further enhanced by giving them an advisory role in the preparation of national fiscal plans. IFIs could assess the underlying assumptions, consistency of the plans with the Commission’s technical trajectory for public debt, and the reform and investment commitments. This would reinforce national ownership.
We also support the European Fiscal Board contributing significantly to economic governance at the EU level. This could include an enhanced role in assessing the appropriate fiscal stance of the euro area as well as the need to activate or extend the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Missing elements in the EU fiscal governance framework
My second key takeaway from the ECB opinion relates to a conspicuous absence from the proposed new economic governance framework: the euro area dimension.
As I have previously argued, this pertains to the need for an enhanced framework to monitor and steer the aggregate fiscal stance of the euro area, which is a fundamental requirement for smooth monetary-fiscal interactions in our region.
But this also concerns, crucially, completing EMU through the establishment of a properly designed permanent central fiscal capacity (CFC).
Without the establishment of a CFC, euro area governance will remain incomplete – a view shared by policymakers, institutions and academics.[23]As I have argued elsewhere,[24]it is an illusion that EMU can function smoothly without a centralised fiscal capacity. It is now time to address the imbalances in the institutional framework of the monetary union, whereby a single monetary policy coexists with a fiscal policy that is fragmented across national lines.
Moreover, without a permanent common fiscal capacity with a borrowing function, balancing fiscal sustainability, stabilising public finances and addressing Europe’s substantial investment needs will be impossible. The weakness of public investment in the euro area, particularly in the years following the great financial crisis, is a case in point (Chart 6).
The establishment of a CFC is also crucial to gain fiscal credibility, which requires common rules and spending by the centre. The debate on this issue is still in its early stages, and more analysis is needed on the relationship between fiscal rules and the CFC.[25]
In my view, a CFC should have three main objectives. First, to achieve effective macroeconomic stabilisation. Second, to support public investment at the national level, with positive spillovers for all. And third, to enable investment in common public goods that benefit the entire European economy and promote a healthy strategic autonomy. These public goods include investments in the green and digital transitions, common defence and energy security, migration policies, and the development of new technological infrastructure in innovative sectors.[26]
Such a capacity is essential to improve our fiscal governance.
A permanent stabilisation function would ensure that investment is not compromised during economic downturns, thus preventing pro-cyclicality and supporting capital accumulation without sacrificing future prosperity.
In addition, managing centralised investment projects at the European level could generate economies of scale, promote positive externalities and raise productivity across the bloc.
Let me give a concrete example of the potential economic benefits of a CFC: the financing of joint military research and development (R&D) spending and innovative investments in defence capabilities.[27]
In today’s geopolitical environment, military spending in EU countries is widely expected to rise to the NATO commitment of 2% of GDP, and even higher in some countries (Chart 7). This additional, significant fiscal burden could crowd out other productive investments.
At the same time, ECB research shows that the efficiency of military spending in the EU lags behind that of other global players. This reflects the fragmentation of the military procurement system and the fact that EU countries spend relatively more on personnel than on R&D, which would produce much higher fiscal multipliers.
Recent research concludes that a CFC aimed at financing military expenditure would support long-term productivity if it shifted resources away from personnel compensation, which currently accounts for the bulk of national defence expenditure, towards financing projects such as investments in capital infrastructure and R&D.[28]
As a central banker, I do not comment on the defence policy of EU Member States. However, one thing is clear: from an economic perspective, the external security of the EU is a European public good. There is therefore a strong economic case for a CFC to finance joint spending on R&D and defence capabilities.
Whatever the ultimate goals of a permanent CFC, its funding through common EU borrowing would contribute to the creation of a European safe asset, with important benefits for the functioning of our financial system. Indeed, a European risk-free benchmark rate would allow for the homogeneous development and pricing of risky assets across the euro area, facilitating diversification, the availability of pan-European collateral and the expansion of activities typical of advanced capital markets.[29]This would be a decisive step towards the creation of a genuine capital markets union, which is an essential element for the efficient allocation of resources and the financing of the real economy.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances requires addressing both components of the debt-to-GDP ratio. Fiscal policy should be countercyclical in order to smooth economic fluctuations, while fostering public investment to support potential growth.
And for fiscal policies to contribute to both price and macro-financial stability, they need to complement monetary policy when needed. Price stability, in turn, supports fiscal sustainability by keeping government financing costs low over time.
To be successful and deliver both fiscal sustainability and growth, the fiscal governance reform must reflect the lessons learned from the past and provide the necessary safeguards by protecting investment, incentivising reform, ensuring national ownership and providing a simple and stable framework.
But we also need to address the missing elements of the proposed reform. Moving from fiscal governance to fiscal union requires a permanent central fiscal capacity. This is necessary to complement national fiscal policies and achieve the appropriate fiscal stance for the euro area.
A European fiscal capacity is essential to finance the common investments that are key to maintaining and expanding Europe’s economic potential. Without it, we will not be able to meet the financing needs, reap the economies of scale and trigger the private investment needed to drive Europe’s energy transition, digital transformation and security architecture. We need to start thinking now about what comes after Next Generation EU, or risk taking a step back instead of forward.
Sound fiscal governance is a cornerstone of the European project. We all have a role to play, and I am confident that today’s workshop will enrich and advance the debate.
Thank you for your attention."

Introductory remarks by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Legal Conference organised by the European Central Bank on “The incorporation of environmental considerations in the supervision of prudential risks”
Frankfurt am Main, 5 September 2023
This year has been a record year in many respects. July was the world’s hottest ever month, seeing the hottest day ever recorded, while ocean temperatures hit all-time highs. We have experienced heatwaves, droughts, floods, gigantic hail and record low levels of sea ice formation in Antarctica. Climate scientists attribute these records to human-made climate change, exacerbated by the arrival of El Niño.
Not only do these events cause extensive damage to the environment and result in enormous human suffering, but they also adversely impact the macroeconomy, giving rise to significant financial risks.[1]
Dealing with financial risks is the core task of prudential supervision.
Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.[2]The topic of today’s panel discussion – the legal aspects of the incorporation of environmental risks in prudential supervision – could therefore not be more apt or timely.
I am thrilled to be chairing an all-female panel on this important topic with three distinguished speakers, each of whom I will introduce before they speak.
In my short introductory remarks, I would like to explain why C&E risks warrant special supervisory attention from an economic perspective.
There are three main reasons. First, their size, global dimension and non-linearity, which imply large downside tail risks. Second, the irreversible nature of climate change and environmental degradation, and the corresponding time criticality for taking action. And third, the lack of knowledge and data on these risks.
Size, global dimension and non-linearity
The sheer size of C&E risks justifies giving them special attention. Climate change constitutes an existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.
According to the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), up to 13% of global GDP would be at risk by the end of the century, even before accounting for the potential consequences of severe weather events, sea-level rise and wider societal impacts from migration or conflict.[3]
Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally, as evidenced by today’s simultaneous occurrence of extreme weather events, limiting the scope for diversification and creating systemic risks for the financial sector. The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing the large climate insurance protection gap. In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-related catastrophes are insured, giving rise to additional risks to the macroeconomy, financial stability and public finances.[4]At the same time, financial sector risks are not confined to physical climate risks; the sector is also exposed to transition risks emanating from changes in policies around the globe in response to climate change.[5]
Lastly, the existence of tipping points may give rise to strong non-linearities. Small changes can have much larger effects than observed historically, making predictions highly uncertain.
Irreversibility and time criticality
A second distinct feature of C&E risks is that if they materialise, the effects are often irreversible. Therefore, taking action is time critical to slow down global warming and the degradation of the environment.
An orderly climate transition is more likely if decisive action is taken at an early stage. In an orderly transition, a sudden repricing of assets can be avoided and financial intermediaries are able to gradually rebalance their investment portfolios and build up buffers that can absorb potential future losses.[6]
Moreover, in contrast to other risks, C&E risks have an important feedback mechanism, which accentuates time criticality. Not only does climate change affect the risks on financial intermediaries’ balance sheets, but the financing of climate or environmentally unfriendly activities also amplifies C&E risks, creating externalities.
Lack of knowledge and data
A third important feature of C&E risks is that the data available and the knowledge we have about them remain limited. We know that climate change and biodiversity loss are already unfolding rapidly but we still lack knowledge about their precise timing and potential tipping points. This means that we must work with scenarios with an unknown probability of occurrence.
Economic models of climate change are typically calibrated on historical data, which means they have difficulties in accounting for non-linear dynamics that have never been observed. They may therefore underestimate the economic fallout. The use of scenarios, as done in macroeconomic climate stress tests, provides a useful way forward. But such scenarios may need to be enriched by socioeconomic factors, such as the risk of violent conflict or mass migration.[7]
Even for known risks, the data are limited. Private and official data providers are working intensively to close the data gaps. To make progress on this front, there is an urgent need for further disclosure initiatives based on the double materiality principle.[8]
In view of the existing data and knowledge gaps, it is very likely that climate-related and environmental risks are currently underpriced. Some risks may not be priced at all, as confirmed by recent research.[9]Rating agencies have only just started to incorporate climate risk into their models.
According to our bottom-up climate stress test, most banks under European banking supervision insufficiently consider climate-related risks in their credit assessments.[10]At the same time, various initiatives on the supervisory front show that banks are making progress in their management of C&E risks, although the trend is not uniform and laggards remain in all areas.[11]
Market mispricing of C&E risks can only be mitigated if more information on those risks becomes available, especially via comprehensive disclosures. In this respect, we still have a long way to go.
To conclude, climate-related and environmental risks warrant special attention owing to their size, global dimension and non-linearity, the irreversible nature of the damage they can cause, the resulting time criticality of action, as well as knowledge and data gaps."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Distinguished Speakers Seminar organised by the European Economics & Financial Centre
London, 4 September 2023
We find ourselves in a world marked by substantial volatility. In recent years, a series of unprecedented crises have profoundly affected people and their everyday lives. To steer the economy through these challenging times, policymakers need to manage people’s expectations – not only about inflation, but also about climate policies, geopolitical shifts and many other areas.
In this respect, communication plays a vital role in the art of effective policymaking today, and this is especially true for central banks like the ECB. But several changes in the media landscape – from new technologies to the rising tide of fake news – have made it increasingly difficult for policymakers to “cut through” to the wider public.
In other words, just as the need for effective communication has grown, so too has the difficulty for policymakers to make their voices heard. This is a problem that we cannot afford to ignore. As Ludwig Wittgenstein once observed, “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world”.[1]
So how can policymakers break through those limits when communicating with the wider public? In short: when the world changes, we must change with it. The way we communicate needs to reflect the new environment in which we are operating.
I will discuss the communication challenges we face today, the communication dimension of monetary policy, and propose how we can improve our communication by being more accessible and humbler.
The challenges facing policy communication
Today’s communications landscape presents two key challenges for policymakers, including central bankers: the ever-increasing competition for attention and the risks presented by an overarching decline in trust.
In the past, policymakers could rely on a communication channel that was largely a “one-way street”. Key messages were typically relayed to the wider public in a concentrated manner via traditional mass media, such as television, radio and newspapers.
But today the communications landscape has changed dramatically – with the flow of information both accelerating and fragmenting.
The advent of the internet and the 24/7 news cycle has meant that the competition for people’s attention has increased markedly. And the rise of social media has seen communication become a “two-way street”: anyone with a smartphone is potentially a journalist, publisher or influencer who can make their views heard.
These changes make it considerably more difficult to communicate policy effectively.
For starters, policymakers can no longer take people’s attention for granted in the internet era. One recent study finds that the average duration of attention on a screen has plummeted from around 150 seconds in 2004 to a mere 47 seconds today.[2]
It has also become increasingly challenging to disseminate factual information. Falsehoods on Twitter, now known as X, are found to spread about 10 to 20 times faster than facts.[3]And more opinionated tweets are likely to reach more people. For instance, research shows that ECB-related tweets with negative, stronger or more subjective views are more likely to be retweeted, liked or replied to.[4]
This shifting communications landscape has contributed to the second challenge facing policymakers around the world – the risks presented by declining trust.
One global survey concludes that almost half of respondents believe their government is a source of false or misleading information.[5]Another international study finds that, on average, only four in ten respondents trust news “most of the time” – with lower levels of trust found in countries with a more polarised political environment.[6]
And this has naturally affected trust in public institutions, including central banks. For much of the 2010s, net trust in the ECB fell to negative levels.[7]And while average trust increased after our rapid response to the pandemic, it began to fall again in tandem with the recent rise in inflation.[8]
But this also underscores another important factor depressing trust: the sheer complexity of the environment we find ourselves in. We have repeatedly faced crises over the last decade which have, to some extent, undermined the public’s faith in how the macroeconomic environment is managed and in economists’ forecasting ability. This is not a problem we can easily resolve.
On the one hand, many of the policy challenges that central bankers and other policymakers are facing today, like bringing down inflation or tackling climate change, are forward-looking in nature. To successfully tackle them, we need to make projections about the future and introduce policies well in advance.
But on the other hand, in a more volatile world, those projections are more likely to quickly become outdated, and policies based on them might have to be adjusted or reversed. That can affect the credibility of experts. For example,research suggests that households trust central bank forecasts less if their recent performance has been poor.[9]
The importance of monetary policy communication today
At the ECB, we take this environment of fragmented communication and declining trust extremely seriously.
Conveying our policy messages to the wider public is critical for the legitimacy of independent central banks in democratic societies and for the effectiveness of monetary policy.[10]Communication plays a crucial role in influencing people’s inflation expectations.[11]
This task is an urgent one. Today’s environment presents us with two key reasons why we must seize the moment in communicating more effectively: high inflation and high levels of attention on inflation.
In the first two decades of the ECB’s existence, average inflation in the euro area was 1.7%.[12]And even though there were times when inflation was either too high or too low during that period, the high inflation we have faced in the past two years is unique. Last October, headline inflation peaked at a record 10.6%.
In this setting, it is paramount not only to take decisive action to bring inflation down, but also to communicate effectively to ensure that medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored during the process. More than ever, credibly conveying that inflation will return to our 2% target over the medium term has been vital to help prevent self-fulfilling inflationary dynamics from taking hold.
This is in part because consumers are highly sensitive to some of the main drivers of the inflation we have recently seen. For instance, survey-based evidence suggests that price perceptions of food and other frequently purchased goods such as fuel have a very important influence on inflation expectations for the average euro area consumer.[13]
While inflation is now falling, effective communication is likely to remain of paramount importance even after the current inflation spike is over. As I discussed recently at Jackson Hole[14], we are entering a world of major transitions in labour markets, energy markets and geopolitics, all of which can lead to larger and more frequent relative price shocks. And in this world, it will be critical for central banks to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored while these relative price changes play out.
The second key reason – high levels of attention on inflation – underlines the importance of central banks conveying their commitment to price stability to the wider public more effectively sooner rather than later.
When inflation was low, one of the communication challenges faced by central banks was that there was little need to be informed about issues related to monetary policy.[15]This “rational inattention” of citizens was in part due to the success of monetary policy,[16]because when prices are stable, people do not need to spend time and effort to track inflation and worry about it. For instance, in May 2021 – a month when year-on-year inflation stood at 2%[17]– a survey found that 55% of euro area citizens were not interested in the ECB and its policies, almost half of whom said they were not interested at all.[18]
But now that inflation is high, households are becoming more attentive. Inflation has become one of the most pressing concerns for Europeans.[19]In the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, over 60% of households reported at the start of the year that they were paying more attention to inflation than they had done in the past. Recent research also finds that these same households have expectations of inflation that are much closer to actual levels of inflation.[20]
The current environment presents central banks with both a risk and an opportunity: people are now paying more attention to inflation, which may increase the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations; but because of that higher attention, they may be more willing to listen to us, which gives us a valuable window of time to deliver our key messages.
So how should we move forward?
Improving monetary policy communication
First, actions speak louder than words. Research suggests that the strongest factor in building trust in central banks is being perceived as able to deliver on our mandate.[21]And to deliver on that mandate, we have increased our policy rates by a cumulative total of 425 basis points in the space of 12 months – a record pace in record time. And we will achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.
But action must be supported by communication. There are two ways in which improving our communication can support our policy moves: more accessibility and more humility.
Historically, central banks have tended to communicate mainly with financial market participants and other experts – audiences that typically listen closely and have more expertise in the issues that central banks talk about.[22]This “comfort zone” led central banks to use rather complex language. But complexity limits the reach of the ECB’s monetary policy communication, particularly with non-expert audiences.[23]
A series of crises have not helped the situation. Central banks’ toolkits have expanded dramatically since the global financial crisis – and so too has the length of monetary policy communications. Between 2007 and 2020, the year the pandemic arrived, the average length of the press release announcing the ECB’s monetary policy decisions increased more than sevenfold.
So, given the scarcity of attention in today’s media landscape, we need to be more accessible in how we communicate.
The outcome of our strategy review has helped in this regard. Our inflation target of 2% – which came into effect in 2021 – is simpler, clearer and easier to communicate than our prior inflation aim of “below, but close to, 2%”, which was in force before the strategy review.[24]
Accessible language also increases the benefits of a clear inflation target. The effects of telling people about our target tend to last longer if the information is accompanied by explanations about the rationale for that target and its implications for how monetary policy can stabilise the economy. Providing these explanations increases one measure of ECB credibility by around 10%.[25]
Research also shows that clearer ECB communication leads to more engagement in traditional and social media.[26]One study finds that making monetary policy communication simpler and more relatable to people’s lives boosts their understanding of key messages by 40%.[27]
With all this in mind, our strategy review also led us to revamp how we communicate our monetary policy decisions – specifically, the Governing Council’s communication at the press conference – while complementing it with a new, layered version that is tailored to non-expert audiences.
The monetary policy statement uses language that is demonstrably less complex than its predecessor, the introductory statement.[28]And it is accompanied on the same day by its visual counterpart, the “monetary policy statement at a glance”, which uses simpler language and visuals that people can relate to, and is available in all EU languages.[29]
These efforts can play into the second element I mentioned earlier: humility.
An increasingly uncertain world makes the task of public institutions harder, especially when it comes to forecasting. And we need to explain this better to the wider public – what we can and cannot know, and what it will take to continue delivering on our mandates in this environment.
Humility in how we communicate is key to fostering trust. To rebuild confidence in expert institutions, we need to do a better job of conveying the uncertainty we face and the inherent challenge in conducting forward-looking policymaking in this environment. That means being open about the limits of what we know, the areas where we have missed the mark, and what we are doing about it.
Right now, it is important for us to acknowledge that, like other central banks, we underestimated both the dynamics of inflation and its persistence. But we have been making changes to our forecasting process to address these issues. For example, we have published sensitivity analyses of key variables like energy prices and wages, and we used scenario analysis during the pandemic and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
We are also aiming to be more transparent in accounting for our forecast errors. Even if these errors were to deplete trust, we can mitigate this if we talk about forecasts in a way that is both more contingent and more accessible, and if we provide better explanations for those errors. For this reason, ECB staff have started publishing the main factors behind our inflation forecast errors, and we intend to continue doing so.[30]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The effective communication of policy will always be a challenging endeavour.
Ben Bernanke, the former Chair of the Federal Reserve, once observed that “monetary policy is 98% talk and only 2% action”.[31]Of course, we can debate these percentages – especially after the last 12 months of central banks across advanced economies tightening their monetary policy. But there should be no doubt: it is not only about getting policy right – we also have to talk about it in the right way.
In an environment of too-high inflation, the current high level of attention to prices presents both a challenge and an opportunity for central banks.
On the one hand, increased attention to inflation developments may contribute towards a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. But on the other hand, it is exactly when people are paying most attention that central banks should deliver their key communication to ensure that those expectations remain firmly anchored.
So let us seize the moment. And I have no doubt we can do so effectively by embracing accessibility and humility in how we pursue and communicate our monetary policy to the citizens of the euro area.
Because we must never forget that they are the people who we ultimately serve.
Thank you."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the ECB Legal Conference
Frankfurt am Main, 4 September 2023
Introduction
It is a pleasure to welcome you to Frankfurt and to the ECB’s Legal Conference. Arriving this morning and seeing such a large gathering of lawyers – attentive, curious and pleased to see old friends again – I am reminded of the “back-to-school” feeling after the summer.
I hope my intervention today can channel that energy towards the major challenge of our time: the climate and environmental crises. After all, summers now are very different from those we may remember from our youth.
Some Europeans faced hell this summer. Record-breaking heatwaves scorched the Mediterranean. Forest fires claimed lives and destroyed homes in Greece. And residents in northern Italy and central Europe were hit by extreme flooding. Meanwhile, similar disasters have been unfolding worldwide. Canada is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record. Wildfires in Hawaii killed more than 100 people. And recent flooding in China is thought to have displaced over one million people. Without human-induced climate change, these events would have been virtually impossible.[1]Back in 2015 Mark Carney spoke about thetragedy of the horizon.[2]Eight years on, we have arrived at that horizon. The tragedy is upon us and it has started to unfold.
Today is therefore an appropriate moment to recall one of the key channels through which Mark Carney anticipated that the financial sector – and financial stability – would be affected by the climate crisis:liability risk.And by that I am referring to climate and environment-related litigation.
A recent UN report observed that climate-related litigation is central to efforts to compel both governments and corporate actors to pursue more ambitious climate change mitigation and adaptation goals.[3]While governments were the most common targets of such litigation in the past, cases are now also increasingly being filed against corporates.
For supervisors and banks alike, this is becoming a major source of risk that needs to be properly anticipated and addressed. And it is particularly important at a time when non-financial but also financial companies, including banks, are becoming the direct targets of such litigation. This brings me to the key message of my remarks today: litigants are coming after the banks, “come hell or high water”[4]. And the banks need to be prepared.
The ECB’s Legal Conference is the perfect forum to discuss this topic for two reasons. First, it is about the role of lawyers – and of courts – in the fight against the climate and environmental crises. Second, as banking supervisor, the ECB finds that banks still need to make significant progress in increasing their awareness of climate and environment-related litigation risk, and they need to be better prepared to address this risk.[5]
Climate-related litigation and its impact on the financial sector – new reports by the Network for Greening the Financial System
The rise in climate-related litigation should not come as a surprise. The Network for Greening the Financial System[6](NGFS) already identified it as an emerging source of risk for the financial sector back in 2021.[7]And in fact, I also spoke about it at the ECB Legal Conference two years ago.[8]
Since then, the number of cases has exploded. Globally, some 560 new cases have been filed since 2021.
Against this backdrop, last Friday the NGFS published two new reports on climate-related litigation. The first provides an update on this trend and considers how it may affect banks and the financial sector.[9]The second looks at how this risk needs to be addressed from a supervisor’s perspective.[10]
Expanding precedents – from States to companies
As the NGFS report shows, litigation first targetedStates.
One of the first landmark cases was the Urgenda case in the Netherlands in 2019. The Dutch Supreme Court ordered the Dutch Government to take more ambitious action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The success in the Urgenda case has since been replicated in cases before the highest courts in France, Ireland and Germany – though naturally with different legal arguments, tailored to each legal system. These cases against States are often referred to as “systemic” climate cases[11]and have been launched in no fewer than 34 jurisdictions worldwide.[12]The cases bring about and accelerate changes in policy, while also providing clarity on duties and responsibilities. But they are also an increasingly important source of transition risk for the economy and the financial sector, as they can lead to rapid court-mandated pivots in public policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the economy.
Moreover, we have recently seen a remarkable increase incases against corporates. Litigation has been launched against a wide range of companies across various sectors of the economy. Fossil fuel and energy companies have been obvious targets, but also car manufacturers, airlines, food companies and producers of concrete and plastics. A wide variety of legal arguments are being used as the basis for such claims.[13]We are seeing claims fordamages under tort law, for breaches ofcorporate due diligence lawsand forgreenwashing[14]. And we are also increasingly seeing non-governmental organisations (NGOs) buying shares in companies, so that they can subsequently attempt to make the directors personally liable forbreaching their fiduciary dutiesto adapt the company to the climate transition.
A telling aspect of this trend is the strategic approach that these litigants take: their lawyers build their cases on the arguments and experiences of peers in other jurisdictions, cooperating through cross-border networks while also developing jurisdiction-specific arguments and strategies. A line of argument that has been successful in one jurisdiction does not necessarily lead to a similarly successful outcome in another, but some arguments have been replicated in multiple countries.
As an example, consider a legal strategy that has proven to be particularly potent in recent years. Once a case against a State has established that the fundamental rights of citizens have been violated, we have seen subsequent cases use this as a basis to argue that private companies also havea duty of care under civil law to protect citizens’ fundamental rights.In practical terms, this means a duty to have a realistic and credible plan to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In the Netherlands, this was a winning argument in the first-instance decision in the case againstShell[15]. The Court ordered Shell to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels, across all activities and all jurisdictions in which it operates.[16]A similar line of reasoning is being used in a case against the Italian company Eni and its shareholders.[17]
These cases are particularly interesting because they do not focus on damages. Rather, they look at the individual firm’s contribution to global emissions and their duty to do their “fair share” to reduce them. In the Shell case, for example, the district court found that while the Paris Agreement is not binding on companies per se, they nevertheless have an obligation to comply with the emission reduction pathway established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The Shell case is currently under appeal. But if the decision by the district court were to be affirmed by the highest court, it could establish a legal obligation under Dutch law for all corporates to proactively reduce their emissions in a way that is aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This would have major repercussions and would quite frankly be revolutionary. Such a duty is not currently priced into, nor part of, firms’ business and transition plans. Up to now, the focus on liability risk has involved looking at actions for damages, and the assumption has been that this risk is somewhat remote, because causation has been difficult to establish. This assumption may turn out to have provided a false sense of security. First, because attribution science may make it easier to prove causation.[18]And second, because Shell-like “fair share” cases take a different approach and don’t need proof of causation.
In any event, these cases pose obvious risks for the financial sector. Companies may face significant direct and indirect financial losses. We are not only talking about the costs of damages, fines, legal costs and the impact on the company’s share price.[19]There could also be potential risks to a company’s viability if a ruling were to result in unexpected adaptation costs or outright stranded assets that had not been priced in. Such a ruling would have an impact on the defendant in the specific case, other companies in the same sector and the banks that finance them.[20]
The next frontier: banks and the financial sector
However, banks will not only be affected indirectly – they may well be sued directly, too. In fact, this is already happening. Litigants are turning their attention to the financial sector,with the idea that if they sue the banks, they can “turn off the taps” of funding to high emitters.[21]
We are already seeing the first examples. There have been cases brought against financial institutions for greenwashing, as well as cases brought against the trustees of pension funds. We have even seen the first case taken directly against a bank under corporate due diligence legislation in France for its role in financing the expansion of fossil fuels.[22]
And we can’t exclude that, in some jurisdictions, litigants will go for the jugular. Like in the Shell case, they could argue that banks also have a duty of care under civil law to protect fundamental rights – and that they must have plans in place to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and the European Climate Law. In other words, plans to reduce their emissions by 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and to immediately stop financing new fossil fuel exploration.[23]
Who is bringing climate litigation?
Part of the reason we must take this risk seriously is because the litigants – in these cases the plaintiffs – have proven to be serious players. Most cases are brought (or supported) by NGOs. We aren’t talking about activists turning up outside courtrooms with cardboard placards. No, the litigants in these cases are sophisticated and use their transnational networks to build precedents across borders. They are well funded, well connected and well organised.[24]And they can – and do – hire the best and brightest lawyers in the field.
How can banks address climate-related litigation risk?
Let me now turn to the practical part of this speech – or thehomework,if I may again draw on the “back-to-school” analogy. How can banks properly address and mitigate climate-related litigation risk? And how can prudential supervisors guide them?
There are two strands of thought here.
The first is the bread-and-butter guidance.In 2020 the ECB published its Guide on climate-related and environmental risks.[25]This guide contains several expectations that can help to address climate-related litigation – within existing categories of risk. These include the need to evaluate litigation risks, define tasks and responsibilities relating to climate risk and conduct climate-related due diligence. With its 2022 thematic review[26], the ECB went a step further, setting institution-specific remediation timelines for meeting the expectations by the end of 2024, including intermediate deadlines of the end of last March and the end of this year. We also provided a compendium of good practices implemented by supervised banks, including practices to address climate and environment-related litigation risks.[27]
I recently asked the CEOs of some of our supervised banks to do me (and themselves) a favour. I suggested to ask their general counsels how closely they are following developments in climate and environment-related litigation. Is Urgenda a household name? Has the Shell case been analysed in depth, and have the possible repercussions for the bank been discussed in detail in board meetings? Have the avenues for possible direct litigation against banks been considered? Has the coverage of personal liability insurance for board members been checked in case their bank was found to be subject to the same obligations as Shell was in first instance and – second – in breach thereof? Today I will repeat this message to all CEOs, their general counsels, and to all executive and non-executive board members of the banks under our supervision: get up to speed with this trend and mitigate the associated risks for your institution.
Some banks have already started to consider climate-related liability risk, and a few have started to quantify possible losses. One example of good practice relates to how banks calculate a client’s credit risk. Some include liability risk as a factor when rating their clients’ probability of default to better price in this type of risk. Another bank assessed reputational risks, including those related to potential greenwashing and financing of polluting industries, by defining a set of scenarios and mapping the possible affected stakeholders and the profit and loss area that would be most affected. In a second step, the bank then used specific case studies to quantify the possible losses that could arise. Another good practice is to mitigate the risk of greenwashing by ensuring adequate disclosures, by considering this risk in the governance framework, and by conducting regular compliance checks.
Another positive example is that if, through its climate and environment-related due diligence exercises, a bank identified climate and environment-related litigation risks for its client (and thus potentially greater credit and reputational risk for the bank itself), it sets up an action plan to address these risks. This action plan could include asking the client to adopt best practices in its sector or, if this avenue is unsuccessful, limiting its business relationship with the client.
Supervisors have homework to do too.The NGFS report on micro-prudential supervision of climate-related litigation risks published last Friday sets out additional potential options for supervision. It emphasises the need for supervisors to take a risk-based approach, which can include performing a materiality assessment of risks at the broader jurisdictional level or a more granular exposure analysis at entity level.
We shouldn’t forget that central banks and supervisors may also be the targets of climate and environment-related litigation, either to ensure that they are doing their part to protect fundamental rights and facilitate compliance with the Paris Agreement or to ensure that they are fulfilling their duties in terms of financial stability or consumer and investor protection.[28]
The importance of Paris-aligned transition plans
The second strand of thought is the well-known saying “if you fail to plan, you plan to fail”.Banks need to be aware that in certain jurisdictions the impact of climate-related litigation could dig right down into the viability of their business models. And given the determination of the NGOs, and their knack for forum shopping – choosing the jurisdiction most likely to provide a favourable verdict –, we don’t know how many banks they will be aiming for.To address this source of litigation risk, the best advice I can give is that banks should start putting in place their Paris-aligned transition plans.
By this, I don’t mean a slick advertising campaign with glossy photos of rainforests – that is just a recipe for greenwashing accusations. I mean realistic, transparent and credible transition plans that banks can and actually do implement in a timely manner. Having such plans in place requires banks to ensure they have accurate, granular data; that they conduct a robust materiality assessment; that they integrate transition planning into their internal discussions and strategic decision-making and that they establish proper internal governance to this effect. With these elements in order, banks should be able to communicate how they are positioning themselves throughout the transition to a climate-resilient and sustainable economy. This would demonstrate the degree to which they are doing their “fair share”. Moreover, a transparent and credible transition plan should enable stakeholders to fully understand the risk environment in which a bank operates. Therefore, clearly articulating the processes and actions related to the transition plan should also significantly contribute to reducing litigation risk.
This is particularly important when we look at the feedback loop between climate and environment-related legislation and litigation.[29]It is only a matter of time before bank transition plans become mandatory under EU law. There are now three pieces of legislation in the pipeline that will require banks to put transition plans in place: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the proposed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the recent Capital Requirements Directive proposal.[30]This new legislation alone could prompt further climate litigation, with litigants finding additional legal bases for their claims.
Of course, no one – not supervisors, not legislators, and not the courts – can expect individual companies or banks to single-handedly solve the climate crisis.However, based on emerging case-law and the ever-more stringent legislation on transition plans, we can no longer afford the luxury of simply assuming that individual companies do not have a duty to do their “fair share” in the fight against climate change. Banks and supervisors alike must – if only as a precaution – manage the risk of the higher courts finding that this is already a binding duty today.
Environment-related litigation
One last point: today I have mainly used the phrase climate-related litigation, which is focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But we shouldn’t be blind to other trends, such as the rise in environment-related litigation more broadly. As alarm at the decline in nature and biodiversity grows – with some considering that humanity has become a weapon of mass extinction[31]– we can expect litigants to turn to the courts, drawing inspiration from their successes in the area of climate. There have already been several cases seeking to hold supermarkets, food producers and even a bank accountable for deforestation in the Amazon.[32]This trend is likely to gather momentum as legislation on supply chains enters into force – the Deforestation Regulation and the proposed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive being two key examples. And arguments about companies’ duty to do their “fair share” to protect fundamental rights by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could also be applied to mitigating other types of environmental degradation.
Conclusions
Let me conclude.
We have arrived at the horizon of the climate crisis, and at the horizon of climate and environment-related litigation risk. Banks still have a lot of homework to do to address this risk, in terms of both meeting the ECB’s supervisory expectations and putting transition plans in place.
This is all the more important given that litigants may increasingly target banks and the wider financial sector, with the aim of driving funding away from carbon-intensive sectors and towards the transition. We need to take action now to anticipate and mitigate this source of risk.
But I would like to end on a more personal note by returning to the legal professionals that have gathered here today.
Lawyers might sometimes see themselves as the upholders of tradition rather than the drivers of change. They might not necessarily see their work – with pen and paper, in front of a computer or in the courtroom – as having a dramatic physical impact on the world, much less saving the planet. But with climate and environment-related litigation, it’s different. The lawyers involved in these cases – be it as counsel, judges, or academics – see that urgent change is needed to protect humanity, by holding society to the commitments of the Paris Agreement, and to protect citizens’ fundamental rights, using the rule of law to achieve these goals.
It brings to mind the poem “Digging” by Seamus Heaney, in which he reflects on whether his creative endeavours could bring the same value to society as his ancestors’ work digging the land to plant and harvest food. He reflects on how to balance his wish to honour his forebears with his drive to follow his own way, using a pen instead of a spade. Heaney concludes: “Between my finger and my thumb, The squat pen rests. I’ll dig with it.”
Lawyers today are also taking up their pens to support the world on a Paris-aligned path. Their pens set in motion the pens of judges. And the pens of judges may well induce real change. Banks must manage all their material risks, including their climate and environmental related litigation risks. Come hell or high water."

Introductory statement by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 4 September 2023
It is a pleasure to be back here to speak before this Committee.
It has been an honour to steer the digital euro project and to discuss it with you every step of the way. Our first hearing took place back in October 2020[1]when the ECB published its very first report on a digital euro[2], well before we decided to officially launch the digital euro investigation phase in October 2021.
We have made considerable progress since then, as can be seen in the many reports and studies we have shared with you. We have made those reports public, enabling citizens and interested stakeholders alike to keep up to date with our investigation.[3]And during the eight hearings I have attended before this Committee, we have discussed 110 of your questions.[4]
Your questions, comments and views – as well as your criticisms – have helped us make progress towards our shared objective: designing an inclusive, truly European digital means of payment that can meet people’s needs and preferences. I would like to sincerely thank this Committee for your support and contributions so far.
But there is still a long journey ahead of us, and further close cooperation between European institutions will be needed in order to determine the optimal design of a digital euro.
We are now approaching a new phase in this project.
In June the European Commission published its single currency package, with legislative proposals on the digital euro and the legal tender status of cash.[5]We welcome those proposals. They put Europe at the forefront of advanced economies when it comes to central bank money.
They create a new paradigm for preserving monetary sovereignty while guaranteeing people’s freedoms in the digital age. The proposed measures would ensure that Europeans are free to choose how they make their everyday payments. A public option would always be available – in the form of both cash and digital euro – alongside private digital means of payment. At the same time, nobody would be required to hold or pay with digital euro, and users would always be able to decide what they use it for.
At the ECB, our investigation phase is now in its final stage, preparing the ground for the Governing Council to decide whether to move to the next phase of the project.
Without prejudice to the ECB opinion that we are going to issue on the proposal, I will start by discussing some key aspects of the legislative proposal. I will then update you on the status of the project and outline the next steps.
A digital euro that is available to everyone, everywhere, free of charge
The legislative proposals on the digital euro and the legal tender status of cash would ensure that, in an increasingly digital world, central bank money remains easily accessible and accepted throughout the euro area. Cash is here to stay. The proposals would enshrine this in legislation. But alongside cash, there would be a new form of central bank money: the digital euro.
The proposal on the legal tender status of cash is the most important European-level legislative initiative on cash since euro banknotes were first issued more than 20 years ago. It would strengthen the status of cash and the rights of those who wish to use it.
The publication of the proposals was a landmark first step. It will now be up to the European legislators to shape the proposals and ensure that a digital euro would replicate key characteristics of cash in the digital sphere. It would do so by offering a means of electronic payment that is available to everyone, everywhere, free of charge, while guaranteeing the highest level of privacy in digital payments. And it could also be used offline.
The democratic debate on these issues is crucial. The ECB stands ready to provide any technical input needed to support your work.
We are currently preparing the ECB opinions on the two proposals.[6]
But let me highlight some key aspects of the digital euro proposal, which are pivotal to ensuring that public money is available to everybody in the digital age.[7]
The first key aspect is legal tender status[8], which would give people the right to have access to, and pay with, digital euro. The proposal would also ensure that users can access digital euro at their current bank, with no need to change banks. This would make the digital euro easily accessible[9]and send a clear message: everybody would be able to use their digital euro whenever and wherever they want to, throughout the euro area.[10]
This option is vital. Just like electricity or water, everyday payments are an essential service, for both individuals and the economy more broadly. We should not leave it to the private sector alone, including big techs, to provide such services. Private closed-loop solutions are becoming increasingly prevalent. Consider instant messaging services – if my family and friends all use the same application, I will increasingly feel the need and the convenience to use it too. We may see similar trends emerging in payments in the future.[11]
The second key aspect is privacy.According to the draft legislation, a digital euro would be a new payment solution with enhanced privacy and data protection, while risks related to money laundering and terrorism financing would be minimised. In line with this, we have proposed that the Eurosystem would be unable to see the personal details of digital euro users or connect any payment information to private individuals.[12]Intermediaries would only see the user information needed for onboarding and compliance with existing regulation, such as anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism rules. Furthermore, the possibility to pay offline would provide cash-like privacy, with neither the intermediary nor the central bank processing the payment.[13]
Third, theCommission proposal achieves a good balance between the pricing objectives of both the public and private sectors. End users could use basic services of the digital euro free of charge[14], while intermediaries would be compensated in a similar way as for comparable private digital means of payment.[15]Merchants would be protected from any excessive fees that could result from the obligation to accept digital euro as legal tender.
Fourth, the proposal recognises the ECB’s ability to develop and apply the tools needed to maintain the equilibrium between private money – like commercial bank deposits – and central bank money.[16]Tools such as holding limits will, by design, pre-empt any undesirable consequences for monetary policy, financial stabilityand the allocation of credit to the real economy.[17]Users wishing to pay more than the set limit will be able to do so by linking their digital euro wallet to their bank account.[18]
We are confident that this equilibrium can be maintained. We have published detailed analyses showing that an appropriate calibration of holding limits avoids risks to the financial system.[19]
Let me emphasise, once again, that the issuance of a digital euro represents an opportunity, not a risk, for the European financial sector. We are designing it as a safe payment tool in order to preserve the role of public money – that is, money backed by the state – while balancing innovation in payments with the stability of the financial sector and guaranteeing privacy.
Our response to the technological revolution in payments cannot be to stand still. The counterfactual to the digital euro is not a benign status quo. In the absence of a digital euro, the emergence of potentially dominant private actors in the digital payments market could have a strong impact on the financial sector.[20]
This is a real possibility, as demonstrated by PayPal’s recent decision to launch its own US dollar-denominated stablecoin for use in digital payments.[21]
Private providers of payment services, including PayPal, have no incentive to limit the take-up of their stablecoins or the range of services they provide. Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.
They may have no incentive to make their payment solutions compatible with those used today. They could offer services at low cost, given the revenue they could generate by reinvesting the reserve assets in an environment with positive interest rates. And while the market entry of big techs or other large payment providers may initially promote innovation, competition could be severely hampered if they attain a monopolistic position, as we have seen in other digital sectors.
This would not be the case with a digital euro. A digital euro would be introduced by public authorities, under a European regulatory framework. It would pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach.
Furthermore, unlike the stablecoins issued by big techs, the digital euro would be distributed by banks and other payment service providers, which would maintain their relationship with their customers. And the ECB is actively cooperating with European payment service providers and other stakeholders to ensure that the digital euro would be fully compatible with existing payment tools and attractive to all.[22]In particular, as mentioned above, the proposed design of the digital euro would guarantee the highest level of privacy for digital payments.
The finishing line for the ECB investigation phase
This brings me to our own project work. We are nearing the end of our investigation phase.
Since our last hearing, we have been performing aholistic review[23]to ensure consistency between all the design options endorsed so far[24], and we have published the results of the prototype and market research exercises.[25]
In addition, we have made further progress with our work on a draft rulebook for a digital euro scheme. Here, too, we are closely collaborating with representatives from all sides of the market: consumers, merchants, banks, payment institutions and public sector professionals.[26]
Next month we will report on the findings of the investigation phase. On this basis, the Governing Council will decide whether to move to the next phase of the project. But again, let me be very clear: a possible decision by the Governing Council to issue a digital euro is not on the table now, and would only be taken after the legislation is adopted.
If we do move to the next phase, the ECB and the national central banks of all euro area countries will continue to analyse digital euro functionalities and eventually move towards developing and testing technical solutions and business arrangements to be ready to start issuing a digital euro, if and when warranted.
In this context, we will of course consider any adjustments that may become necessary because of the legislative deliberations.
We will also continue learning by interacting with all relevant stakeholders. The input we have received so far has been exceptionally valuable and has enhanced our understanding of the challenges that the digital euro must address.
I am sincerely grateful to you, the European Parliament, for our regular and ongoing dialogue and for all the support you have given us since the very beginning of the project. Therefore, should the Governing Council decide to proceed to the next phase, the ECB remains committed to continuing its regular hearings at the ECON Committee to engage with you and to support the democratic debate on the digital euro.
An ambitious path ahead
Let me conclude.
A digital euro will make our money fit for the digital age. It follows in the footsteps of the architects of the euro, who rightly believed that the currency union would only be complete with a tangible form of the euro, issued by the central bank. The digital euro takes their vision forward into a digitalised world. By providing an electronic form of cash, it will preserve people’s freedom to choose between private and public forms of our single currency for their everyday payments.
The future of the digital euro is in your hands. Ultimately, it will only be as ambitious as you want it to be, in line with the legislative framework you adopt.
I personally believe Europe should not shy away from being ambitious in developing an instrument that serves the public interest by making Europe and the euro fit for the digital age. The digital euro will give us a digital means of payment that, like cash, unites us because it can be used by everyone, everywhere. It will strengthen our autonomy and resilience by relying on a European infrastructure and reducing our dependence on a handful of non-European providers.
It is also an opportunity for Europe to lead the international debate on central bank digital currency, with a strong focus on privacy and preserving monetary sovereignty in the digital age.
Most importantly, this will be a project that depends on and will benefit all of us.
And finally, let me express my personal thanks for the interactions we have had over the past few years, and those we will have today. While I will be leaving my position at the ECB, I will remain committed to this project in my new role.
I now look forward to your questions."
121,2023-08-31,Isabel Schnabel,Disinflation and the Phillips curve,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html,"Disinflation and the Phillips curve
Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a conference organised by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research on “Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics 2023”
Frankfurt am Main, 31 August 2023
After more than a year of significant monetary tightening, the outlook for the euro area remains highly uncertain. Activity has moderated visibly, and forward-looking indicators signal weakness ahead. But important pockets of resilience remain, especially the labour market.
Headline inflation has come down, mainly on the back of previous supply-side shocks unwinding. But underlying price pressures remain stubbornly high, with domestic factors now being the main drivers of inflation in the euro area. Therefore, a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy is critical for bringing inflation back to our 2% target in a timely manner.
I would like to start my remarks this morning by discussing the drivers behind the recent deterioration in the economic outlook. I will ask how quickly the slowdown in economic growth can be expected to lead to a decline in underlying price pressures and whether the euro area can still hope for a “soft landing”. This largely depends on the slope of the Phillips curve – a topic that will be discussed extensively at the conference later today.
I will close my remarks by explaining why the current environment of high uncertainty warrants an approach to monetary policy that is data-dependent and robust, in the sense that it considers not only the most likely future path of inflation but the entire distribution of risks. Assessing the monetary policy stance meeting-by-meeting and adjusting it when necessary will ensure that it remains appropriate at all times.
Incoming data point to stagnating activity
For a long time, the euro area economy proved remarkably resilient in the face of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Despite one of the largest terms-of-trade shocks since the Second World War, it defied expectations of recession. This was largely due to the combination of pent-up demand from the pandemic and government measures shielding firms and households from the rise in energy prices.
Over the past few months, however, economic sentiment has steadily deteriorated. In the manufacturing sector, activity and the volume of order books have fallen sharply to levels typically only seen in deep recessions, even if sentiment may be showing first signs of bottoming out (Slide 2, left-hand side).
Weakness has gradually spread from the manufacturing to the services sector. While strong pent-up demand for services has been able to offset the drag on growth coming from industry so far, reported orders and activity in the services sector are now declining, too.
Fiscal policy is also expected to become more restrictive as governments have committed to winding down energy support measures and are expected to embark on gradual fiscal consolidation in line with guidance from the European Commission.
The slowdown in aggregate demand is gradually affecting employment expectations (Slide 2, right-hand side). Although the labour market remains exceptionally tight, the recent reported decline in services firms’ intention to hire, and manufacturing firms’ intention to reduce headcount, is consistent with historical evidence of the labour market weakening only later in the cycle.
In conjunction, these developments point to growth prospects being weaker than foreseen in the baseline scenario of the June Eurosystem staff projections.
At the same time, there are indications that the euro area economy may not be on the brink of a deep or prolonged recession. One encouraging sign is the visible improvement in consumer confidence over previous months, even if the recovery has lately come to a halt (Slide 3, left-hand side).
Confidence has improved on the back of high nominal wage growth, often including generous one-off payments, and declining energy prices, which are providing an increasing compensation for the loss of real disposable income due to the terms of trade shock. This should support private consumption in the future (Slide 3, right-hand side).
Repercussions of energy shock may slow disinflation
Today’s economic conditions pose two important and related questions to policymakers.
The first is whether the current slowdown will prove sufficiently strong and persistent to reduce underlying price pressures in a way that ensures a timely return of inflation to our target. The answer to this question depends on the drivers of the recent deterioration in the business climate.
The marked rise in interest rates has certainly contributed to recent developments. Bank lending flows to both firms and households have dropped sharply in recent months as banks have increased their lending rates and tightened their credit standards (Slide 4).
Our bank lending survey confirms that the level of interest rates is a key reason behind the contraction in loan demand (Slide 5). Credit standards, particularly for loans to firms, are expected to tighten further in the coming months, albeit at a slower pace.
The lagged effect of past policy rate increases implies that monetary policy will continue to dampen aggregate spending. Whether it will besufficientlyrestrictive, however, depends on the broader macroeconomic environment in which central banks operate.[1]
For example, some of the current cyclical drivers, such as the effect of the excess build-up of inventories after the pandemic on industrial orders, may weaken or reverse over time. Similarly, a more resilient US economy may reduce the current drag on euro area exports from weak foreign demand, while a deeper slowdown in China may have the opposite effect.
Moreover, some of the observed developments may be structural rather than cyclical, reflecting the secular challenges facing the euro area economy. Above all, the energy shock is still working its way through the economy and threatens to leave permanent scars on potential growth.[2]
Although wholesale electricity prices have come down from their peak, they remain about three times their level three years ago. Price volatility, and hence uncertainty, also remains significantly higher. In August, European natural gas price futures for delivery in winter increased sharply before falling back again.
Persistently higher input costs are undermining the price competitiveness of firms in energy-intensive sectors (Slide 6, left-hand side). This seems to have contributed to the emergence of a significant and unusual wedge in industrial production of energy-intensive and other sectors (Slide 6, right-hand side).
It is therefore possible that the current weakness in activity is not only the result of a cyclical slowdown in response to increasing interest rates but also a reflection of significant structural headwinds.[3]
The future path of inflation will depend on how the economy tackles these challenges.
Firms could shut down operations and relocate to outside the euro area, thereby reducing potential output.[4]Alternatively, they could accelerate investment in more energy-efficient technologies to restore their competitiveness, possibly supported by public subsidies. This, together with broader efforts to fight climate change, could help explain why investment in machinery and equipment has remained surprisingly resilient so far despite tighter financing conditions (Slide 7, left-hand side).
Our latest bank lending survey corroborates this view. It shows that fixed investment related to the green transition is an increasingly important driver of loan demand, and that climate change had an easing impact for loans to “green” firms and those in transition, while it had a tightening impact for loans to fossil-fuel intensive firms (Slide 7, right-hand side).[5]
Either way, falling supply or rising investment may attenuate the disinflationary effect of tighter monetary policy over the short term.[6]Higher green investment could, however, be disinflationary over the longer term. Therefore, understanding the drivers and consequences of the recent deterioration in the business climate is critical for our assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance.
“Large shocks travel fast”: a state-dependent Phillips curve
The second question facing policymakers is how fast the slowdown, should it persist, will succeed in reducing underlying price pressures. The slope of the Phillips curve is at the heart of this question.
All else being equal, inflation should be more responsive to the economic slowdown the steeper the slope of the Phillips curve. A “soft landing” scenario would see the target inflation rate being reached in the steep part of the curve. By contrast, if the slope is flat around the target, a significant or protracted slowdown in growth may be required to bring inflation back to target.
Over the past few months, underlying inflation measures have sent mixed signals about the pace of disinflation, and hence about the shape of the Phillips curve.[7]
Model-based indicators built to extract the persistent and common component of inflation (PCCI) point to a rapid decline in price pressures. At the same time, other measures, which are more closely related to domestic demand and labour costs, remain elevated, with no clear signs of a turning point yet (Slide 8, left-hand side).
One reason for this divergence seems to be related to the role of supply-side factors, which are expected to drop out over time. Removing their estimated effects on underlying inflation notably reduces the range spanned by underlying inflation measures. But even in this case, underlying price pressures remain elevated, suggesting that inflation is, to a significant extent, driven by demand-led factors.
Sector-specific inflation rates provide an equally heterogeneous picture. While inflation has started to decline rapidly in the non-energy industrial goods sector, it is still rising in the services sector, where the price momentum also remains uncomfortably high despite its recent decline (Slide 8, right-hand side).
This heterogeneity implies that there is no single Phillips curve but a set of different curves pointing to different paces of disinflation across sectors and countries.
Moreover, the slope of the Phillips curve is likely to vary over time.
A growing strand of research, often using firm-level data, shows that the shape of the Phillips curve is highly state-dependent.[8]When marginal costs increase rapidly and threaten to erode profit margins, firms tend to raise their prices more frequently. As a result, the Phillips curve becomes steeper.
This is what we have seen over the past two years. As the energy shock hit the euro area and marginal costs increased at a pace not seen since the oil price shocks of the 1970s, the share of goods and services seeing price increases rose sharply (Slide 9, left-hand side).
As a result, inflation surged in a way that was not consistent with the common assumption of time-dependent price setting behaviour by firms.[9]In other words, if prices are far away from their optimal level, firms are more likely to adjust them (Slide 9, right-hand side).[10]Or, as Francesco Lippi recently put it at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, “large shocks travel fast”.
The question, then, is whether the Phillips curve continues to be as steep today as it has been in the recent past. If it were, the sharp decline in marginal costs on the back of the fall in energy prices would drive inflation down just as quickly as higher costs had pushed it up.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may not be the case, as there is often an asymmetry between positive and negative cost-push shocks. While firms are quick to pass large cost increases on to consumers, they may be more reluctant to pass on declines in marginal costs.[11]
And indeed, the share of firms currently planning to reduce prices is nowhere near the share of firms that intended to raise prices when marginal costs were increasing, even though producer and import prices are currently falling more rapidly than they had risen before (Slide 10).
In the manufacturing sector, only 12% of firms said in August that they intended to cut prices, with a similar share reporting planned price increases. In the retail and services sectors, far more firms still plan to raise rather than reduce prices. This suggests that the reversal of previous cost-push shocks will take time to be fully reflected in underlying inflation numbers.
Research suggests that the presence of trend inflation, which is largely determined by the central bank’s inflation target, can help explain this stylised fact.[12]
If firms expect the general price level to rise over time, they will hesitate to reduce prices in the presence of negative cost shocks, or at least they will do so very cautiously. This is because trend inflation will over time re-align their prices with those of their competitors even in the absence of price cuts.
One takeaway, therefore, is that a microfounded Phillips curve based on marginal costs rather than the output gap can help explain the surge in inflation. But such a curve would likely point to price pressures fading more gradually.[13]
Labour shortages can lead to a steeper Phillips curve
Research that will be presented later today, however, suggests that, for the United States, a Phillips curve built on an adequate measure of labour market tightness can explain last year’s inflation outburst equally well, with potentially different implications for the pace of disinflation.[14]
All that is needed is downward wage rigidity that makes the slope of the Phillips curve non-linear. Without giving too much away, Gauti will show that labour shortages, defined as the number of job vacancies exceeding the number of unemployed workers, was accompanied by a rapid surge in inflation in the United States, implying a steepening of the Phillips curve.
In the euro area, as economies reopened after the pandemic, the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers also increased sharply to record highs, but it remains notably below the unitary threshold identified by Gauti and Pierpaolo.
The question is whether this threshold is necessarily identical across countries for labour shortages to generate inflation. In the euro area, unemployment is structurally higher than in the United States. More than a third of those currently unemployed have been out of work for 12 months or more, which typically reduces their likelihood of finding work again.[15]
In other words, it could well be that labour market tightness in the euro area is consistent with ratios of vacancies to unemployed workers being lower than in the United States.
Indeed, many indicators are signalling unprecedented tightness in the euro area labour market. For example, the share of firms reporting labour as a factor holding back production remains near record highs (Slide 11, left-hand side).[16]
In any case, the shape of the euro area Phillips curve using the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers looks strikingly similar to that in the United States (Slide 11, right-hand side). A soft-landing scenario would see inflation fall back quickly towards the 2% target on the steep part of the curve, provided that both the shape and location of the Phillips curve remain unchanged.[17]
So, all in all, how the euro area economy will ultimately adjust to the tightening of monetary policy will crucially depend on whether consumer prices will be as flexible on the way down as they were on the way up, and on whether the imbalances in the labour market will be resolved in a way that brings wage growth back to a level in line with our 2% target, thereby containing second round effects and keeping inflation expectations anchored.
This uncertainty about the pace of disinflation is also reflected in recent developments in market-based measures of inflation compensation.
In the past, a slowing economy, or expectations thereof, tended to systematically go hand in hand with investors requiring less compensation for being exposed to inflation risk over the policy-relevant horizon (Slide 12, left-hand side). This is currently not the case, however, as inflation-linked swap rates have increased measurably in recent months, mainly driven by an increase in inflation risk premia (Slide 12, right-hand side).
Such a countercyclical pattern could be consistent with investors hedging against the risks of central banks not leaning forcefully enough against inflation remaining above target.
One way to see how the market perceives the monetary policy stance is to look at the gap between short-term real risk-free rates and a market-based measure of the natural rate of interest. Until recently, this gap was deeply negative. This means that, so far, most of the increase in real short-term rates removed policy accommodation. Only recently, rates moved into firmly restrictive territory (Slide 13).
Uncertainty calls for data-dependent and robust approach to monetary policy
The uncertainty about the pace of disinflation lends support to the data-dependent approach adopted by the Governing Council. This approach recognises that monetary policy needs to be mindful of, and responsive to, the way the economy reacts to the steepest rate hiking cycle in the history of the euro area. The lack of a historical precedent means that we can rely less on past experience.[18]
Therefore, at every upcoming meeting, we will assess whether the impact of the cumulative tightening on the future path of inflation is sufficiently strong to ensure a sustained and timely return of inflation to our 2% target, or whether the pace of disinflation is too slow for us to be confident that our current monetary policy stance can provide medium-term price stability.
To ensure robustness, we will need to consider not just the baseline scenario for the inflation outlook but the entire distribution of risks. This is because even though forecast errors are starting to become smaller, there is still an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty about the medium-term inflation outlook.
This can be seen when considering our latest survey of professional forecasters. Both individual uncertainty, measured by the average of the standard deviations of each respondent’s probability distribution, and aggregate uncertainty, measured by the standard deviation of the aggregate probability distribution, remain exceptionally high (Slide 14).
And although the disagreement across survey participants, measured by the standard deviation of point forecasts, has recently declined, it still stands at more than twice the historical average since 1999.
The wide range of views reflects risks in both directions.
Upside risks include stronger-than-expected growth in unit labour costs, possibly driven by lower than projected productivity growth, firmer corporate pricing power and risks of new adverse supply-side shocks.[19]If such risks materialised, inflation could subside only very gradually or could even reaccelerate.
Amongst these upside risks, climate-related risks seem more pressing than ever.[20]Unprecedented non-linearities in sea and air surface temperatures coupled with the speed at which the polar ice caps are melting mean that dangerous tipping points may be reached more quickly than previously expected (Slide 15, left-hand side). Thelatest El Niño event is further reinforcing climate-related risks.
As a consequence, we have recently observed a sharp rise in the number of extreme weather events, which are threatening harvests and tourism. Crucial water routes, such as the Panama Canal, are drying up, causing new supply chain disruptions.
These factors are posing significant risks to food prices and inflation more broadly. While a few food commodity prices have already increased sharply in recent months, most of the effects are likely to become apparent only in 2024 (Slide 15, right-hand side).
On the downside, there is a risk that the effects of monetary policy could unfold more forcefully over the medium term.
For example, while the marked increase in the share of household loans with a fixed interest rate implies that the impact of the increase in policy interest rates on households’ net interest income has been fairly limited so far, these effects could accumulate over time when more and more loans have to be refinanced at higher rates.
On net, respondents in our survey of professional forecasters judge that the balance of risk for inflation in 2025 remains tilted to the upside (Slide 16).[21]
Moreover, respondents also see upside risks to inflation over the longer term. The distribution of inflation expectations for 2028 continues to show a fat right-hand tail, with a significant probability for inflation outcomes being above 2.5% (Slide 17, left-hand side). Option prices in financial markets also suggest upside risks to the longer-term inflation outlook (Slide 17, right-hand side).
At our upcoming meetings, we will carefully weigh these and other relevant risks.
Should we judge that the policy stance is inconsistent with a timely return of inflation to our 2% target, a further increase in interest rates would be warranted. In an environment of tight labour markets and structural inflationary headwinds, this would also insure against the continued elevated risk of inflation remaining above our target for too long.
By contrast, should our assessment of the transmission of monetary policy suggest that the pace of disinflation is proceeding as desired, we may afford to wait until our next meeting to gather more evidence on how the slowdown in aggregate demand will feed through to price and wage-setting over time.
Under this data-dependent approach, we cannot predict where the peak rate is going to be, or for how long rates will have to be held at restrictive levels. We can also not commit to future actions, meaning we cannot trade off a need for a further tightening of monetary policy today against a promise to hold rates at a certain level for longer.
Such a promise would raise time inconsistency issues. If investors anticipated that the central bank in the future might renege on its promise if economic conditions change, they would not price a future path of short-term interest rates that would result in sufficiently restrictive financing conditions.
Ultimately, the incoming data may well prescribe holding rates at restrictive levels over a significant period of time. The degree of restrictiveness, in turn, will also depend on the evolution of inflation expectations, as what ultimately matters for consumption and investment is real, not nominal, interest rates.
The past few weeks have highlighted the pertinence of this consideration. Real risk-free rates have declined across the maturity spectrum and are now back to the level observed at the February Governing Council meeting, as investors have revised their expectations for economic growth, inflation and monetary policy (Slide 18). This decline could counteract our efforts to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner.
By setting monetary policy meeting-by-meeting, with an open mind and based on the incoming data and an assessment of the risks to the inflation outlook, we can take such developments into account to ensure that the key ECB interest rates are set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the annual Economic Policy Symposium ""Structural Shifts in the Global Economy"" organised by Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Jackson Hole
Jackson Hole, 25 August 2023
Over the past three years, people around the world have experienced an unprecedented series of shocks, albeit to varying degrees.
We have faced the pandemic, resulting in a partial shutdown of the global economy. We are confronting a war in Europe and a new geopolitical landscape, leading to profound changes in energy markets and trade patterns. And climate change is accelerating, compelling us to do all we can to decarbonise the economy.
One visible impact of these shifts has been the return of high inflation globally, which has caused anguish for many people. Central banks have responded by tightening monetary policy and, while progress is being made, the fight against inflation is not yet won.
But these shifts could also have profound longer-term implications. There are plausible scenarios where we could see a fundamental change in the nature of global economic interactions. In other words, we may be entering an age of shifts in economic relationships and breaks in established regularities. For policymakers with a stability mandate, this poses a significant challenge­.
We rely on past regularities to understand the distribution of shocks we are likely to face, how they will transmit through the economy, and how policies can best respond to them. But if we are in a new age, past regularities may no longer be a good guide for how the economy works.
So, how can we continue to ensure stability?
The challenge we face was well-captured by the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, who said that “life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards”.
Since our policies operate with lags, we cannot wait for the parameters of this new environment to become entirely clear before we act. We have to form a view of the future and act in a forward-looking way. But we will only ever truly understand the effects of our decisions after the fact. So we will have to establish new frameworks geared towards robust policymaking under uncertainty.
Today, I will lay out the three main shifts characterising the current environment and how they could change the type of shocks we face and their transmission through the economy. I will then touch on the three key elements of robust policymaking in this setting:clarity, flexibilityandhumility.
Shifts in the global economy
Since the pandemic, the European and global economies have undergone three shifts which are changing global markets – and which are playing out over different time horizons.
First, we are seeing profound changes in the labour market and the nature of work.
Labour markets are historically tight across advanced economies – and not only due to strong labour demand after the pandemic. In some economies, workers who left the labour force have not fully returned, be it due to sickness or changing preferences.[1]In others, like the euro area, employment is at record highs, but people are working fewer hours on average.[2]
The pandemic has also accelerated digitalisation,[3]which is likely to affect both the supply of workers and the composition of jobs. Remote working has increased,[4]potentially making labour supply more elastic. And this is now dovetailing with the generative AI revolution, which – like all technological revolutions – is likely to both destroy some jobs and create new ones.
According to one estimate, more than a quarter of jobs in advanced economies rely on skills that could easily be automated.[5]But ECB research also finds that employment shares in occupations more exposed to AI have risen in most European countries over the past decade, refuting the idea that the AI revolution will necessarily lead to a decline in employment.[6]
Second, we are undergoing an energy transition, which in tandem with accelerating climate change is triggering profound transformations in global energy markets.
Although Europe has experienced the largest shock, the global energy mix is also in flux as suppliers that previously balanced the market retreat from it. For some years now, the US shale oil sector has been moving towards a slower growth strategy and investing less in production capacity. And OPEC+ members have been consistently missing their production targets.
At the same time, the push towards renewables is gaining momentum everywhere, driven by fresh concerns about energy security as well as the imperative of climate action.[7]The EU is now aiming for more than 40% of energy generation to come from renewables by 2030, while the United States is on track for the majority of its electricity to be solar and wind-generated by 2050.[8]
Third, we are facing a deepening geopolitical divide and a global economy that is fragmenting into competing blocs. This is being accompanied by rising levels of protectionism as countries reconfigure their supply chains to align with new strategic goals.
Over the past decade, the number of trade restrictions in place has increased tenfold,[9]while industrial policies aimed at reshoring and friend-shoring strategic industries are now multiplying. And while this has not yet led to de-globalisation, evidence of changing trade patterns is mounting.[10]The fragility of global supply chains highlighted by the pandemic has also accelerated this process.[11]
These shifts – especially those related to the post-pandemic environment and energy – have contributed to the steep rise in inflation over the last two years. They have restricted aggregate supply while also directing demand towards sectors with capacity constraints.[12]And these mismatches arose, at least initially, against the backdrop of highly expansionary macroeconomic policies to offset the effects of the pandemic, requiring a rapid policy adjustment by central banks.
Whether all these various shifts will prove to be permanent is not clear at this stage. But it is already evident that, in many cases, their effects have been more persistent than we initially expected. And this raises two important questions about the nature of key economic relationships.
Two questions about key economic relationships
The first question is whether the shocks driving economic fluctuations will change.
In the pre-pandemic world, we typically thought of the economy as advancing along a steadily expanding path of potential output, with fluctuations mainly being driven by swings in private demand. But this may no longer be an appropriate model.
For a start, we are likely to experience more shocks emanating from the supply side itself.[13]
We are already witnessing the effects of accelerating climate change, and this will likely translate into more frequent supply shocks in the future. More than 70% of companies in the euro area have been estimated to be dependent on at least one ecosystem service.[14]The shift in the global energy mix is also likely to increase the size and frequency of energy supply shocks, with oil and gas becoming less elastic[15]while renewables still face intermittency and storage challenges.
Reshoring and friend-shoring also imply new supply constraints, especially if trade fragmentation accelerates before the domestic supply base has been rebuilt. ECB research finds that, in a scenario where world trade fragments along geopolitical lines, real imports could decline by up to 30% globally and could not be fully compensated by greater trade within blocs.[16]
At the same time, our higher exposure to these shocks can trigger policy responses which also move the economy. Most importantly, we are likely to see a phase of frontloaded investment that is largely insensitive to the business cycle – both because the investment needs we face are pressing, and because the public sector will be central in bringing them about.
For example, the energy transition will require massive investment in a relatively short time horizon – around €600 billion on average per year in the EU until 2030.[17]Global investment in digital transformation is expected to more than double by 2026.[18]And the new international landscape will require a significant increase in defence spending, too: in the EU, around €60 billion will be required annually to meet the NATO military expenditure target of 2% of GDP.[19]Even if carbon-intensive capital is written off more rapidly,[20]all this should lead to higher net investment.
Such a phase of higher structural investment needs will make the economic outlook harder to read. In the euro area, for instance, investment rose in the first quarter of this year amid stagnant output, in part because of pre-planned investment spending under the Next Generation EU programme.
The second question concerns how these shocks transmit through the economy.
The new environment sets the stage for larger relative price shocks than we saw before the pandemic. If we face both higher investment needs and greater supply constraints, we are likely to see stronger price pressures in markets like commodities – especially for the metals and minerals that are crucial for green technologies.[21]And relative prices will also need to adjust to ensure that resources are reallocated towards growing sectors and away from shrinking ones.[22]
Large-scale reallocations can also lead to rising prices in growing sectors that cannot be fully offset by falling prices in shrinking ones, owing to downwardly sticky nominal wages.[23]So the task of central banks will be to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored at our target while these relative price changes play out.
And this challenge could become more complex in the future because of two changes in price- and wage-setting behaviour that we have been seeing since the pandemic.
First, faced with major demand-supply imbalances, firms have adjusted their pricing strategies. In the recent decades of low inflation, firms that faced relative price increases often feared to raise prices and lose market share.[24]But this changed during the pandemic as firms faced large, common shocks, which acted as an implicit coordination mechanism vis-à-vis their competitors.
Under such conditions, we saw that firms are not only more likely to adjust prices, but also to do so substantially.[25]That is an important reason why, in some sectors, the frequency of price changes has almost doubled in the euro area in the last two years compared with the period before 2022.[26]
The second change has been the tight labour market, which has put workers in a stronger position to recoup real wage losses. Previously, even when shocks did feed through to prices, the risk of second-round effects was contained as we were mostly operating with persistent labour market slack.[27]But as we are seeing today, when workers have greater bargaining power, a surge in inflation can trigger “catch up” wage growth which can lead to a more persistent inflation process.[28]
We certainly cannot exclude that both these developments are temporary. In fact, we are already seeing some evidence in the euro area that firms are changing prices less frequently, although in an environment with falling energy and input prices.[29]And it is possible that the tightness in the labour market will unwind as the economy slows, supply-demand mismatches created by the pandemic fade and, over time, digitalisation leads to higher labour supply, including by reducing entry barriers.[30]
But we also need to be open to the possibility that some of these changes could be longer-lasting. If global supply does become less elastic, including in the labour market,[31]and global competition is reduced, we should expect prices to take on a greater role in adjustment. And if we also face shocks that are larger and more common – like energy[32]and geopolitical shocks – we could see firms passing on cost increases more consistently.
In that setting, we will have to be extremely attentive that greater volatility in relative prices does not creep into medium-term inflation through wages repeatedly “chasing” prices. That could make inflation more persistent if expected wage increases are then incorporated into the pricing decisions of firms, giving rise to what I have called “tit-for-tat” inflation.[33]
Robust policymaking in an age of shifts and breaks
So, in this age of shifts and breaks, where we do not yet know whether we are returning to the old world or entering a new one, how can we ensure policymaking remains robust?
To my mind there are three key elements:clarity, flexibilityandhumility.
First, we need to provideclarityon our objective, and on unwavering commitment to deliver on it.
Clarity will be important to establish the proper role of monetary policy in the ongoing transitions. We must be clear that price stability is a fundamental pillar of an investment-friendly environment. Faced with a changing world, monetary policy should not itself become a source of uncertainty.
This will be crucial to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored even when there are temporary deviations from our target, as may be the case in a more shock-prone economy. And it will also be key to maintaining public confidence that, even in a new environment, we will not lose sight of our target. We must and we will keep inflation at 2% over the medium term.
But in order to achieve our goals, we needflexibilityin our analysis.
We cannot make policy based on simple rules or intermediate targets in an uncertain economy.[34]And this means that we cannot exclusively rely on models that are estimated with old data, attempting to fine-tune policy around point forecasts. At the same time, we must also avoid the other pitfall of focusing too much on current data and “driving in the rear-view mirror”, since this is likely to make monetary policy a reactive force rather than a stabilising one.
We will instead have to construct policy frameworks that capture the complexity we face and provide a hedge against it – something central banks are already starting to do. In the ECB’s case, we have made our future decisions contingent on three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
These three criteria help mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term outlook by blending together our staff’s inflation projections, the trend that we can extract from underlying inflation, and the effectiveness of our policy measures in countering that trend. Looking ahead, I expect this type of “multi-legged” approach will be needed to calibrate policy effectively. But we will also need to enhance this process by regularly updating our models and forecasting technologies,[35]and with deeper analysis of the variables that act as the best leading indicators.[36]
The third element that is crucial in this new environment ishumility. While we need to continue striving to sharpen our picture of the medium term, we should also be clear about the limits of what we currently know and what our policy can achieve. If we are to maintain our credibility with the public, we will need to talk about the future in a way that better captures the uncertainty we face.
The ECB has already been moving in this direction in our forecasting process, but there is still a way to go. We have published sensitivity analyses of key variables like energy prices and wages, and we used scenario analysis during the pandemic and after the start of the war in Ukraine. We are also aiming to be more transparent in accounting for our forecast errors.
Research suggests that households trust central bank forecasts less if their recent performance has been poor,[37]but we can mitigate this problem if we talk about forecasts in a more contingent way and provide better explanations for errors. For this reason, ECB staff have started publishing the main factors behind our inflation forecast errors and we intend to continue doing so.[38]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
There is no pre-existing playbook for the situation we are facing today – and so our task is to draw up a new one.
Policymaking in an age of shifts and breaks requires an open mind and a willingness to adjust our analytical frameworks in real-time to new developments. At the same time, in this era of uncertainty, it is even more important that central banks provide a nominal anchor for the economy and ensure price stability in line with their respective mandates.
In the current environment, this means – for the ECB – setting interest rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.
And moving forward, we must remain clear in our objectives, flexible in our analysis and humble in how we communicate. As John Maynard Keynes once said, “the difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones”."

Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Bocconi University
Milan, 3 August 2023
In recent years, the euro area has seen multiple supply shocks hitting the economy at the same time. These shocks have combined to create an inflationary shock of such magnitude and persistence that inflation risked becoming entrenched.
These adverse developments coincided with a phase of highly accommodative monetary policy, following a long period of fighting too-low inflation and the risks to price stability associated with the pandemic shock. To avoid exacerbating inflationary pressures by stimulating demand and to prevent the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, we rapidly normalised our monetary policy stance. We increased rates by a total of 425 basis points in the space of just 12 months.
In parallel, the end of net asset purchases and reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP), coupled with the repayment of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations, is making our balance sheet shrink considerably.
With policy rates now firmly in restrictive territory, setting and communicating the direction of monetary policy has become more complex. Our monetary policy stance needs to be calibrated in a way that brings inflation back to target in a timely manner while avoiding unnecessary harm to economic activity.
This is a fine line to walk, as the effects of monetary policy emerge with a lag. While our past decisions have already led to a material tightening in credit conditions and loan dynamics, their effects have yet to be felt in full across the real economy.
At the same time, inflation remains elevated. Even if it is now falling as the effects of adverse supply shocks begin to fade and weaker growth eases price pressures, it will still take some time to reach levels compatible with price stability.
In order to successfully complete the disinflation of the European economy, we need to flexibly adapt our policy to the evolving inflation outlook. In the current context where policy rates are around the level necessary to deliver medium-term price stability, I will argue that monetary policy may operate not just by increasing rates but also by keeping the prevailing level of policy rates for longer. In other words,persistencematters as much aslevel.
This raises challenges for steering our policy stance. I will argue that our data-dependent approach, underpinned by our firm commitment to returning inflation to its target, is equipped to navigate these intricacies.
The transmission of inflation through the economy
Euro area inflation is largely due to a series of adverse supply shocks, notably the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions and the energy shock triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[1]
In 2022, energy prices were the main driver of inflation (Chart 1).[2]The energy shock translated into broad-based price pressures given the impact of rising energy prices on all components of inflation.
Headline inflation across euro area countries lacks a clear correlation with the strength of domestic demand (Chart 2).
While supply shocks are now unwinding, their lagged effects on inflation are still being felt as past increases in input costs are passed on to consumers.
The dynamics of food prices is a case in point. The energy shock and Russia’s war in Ukraine have contributed to a spike in food prices.[3]While the food producer price index peaked last October and food consumption has fallen in real terms in some euro area countries,[4]consumer food inflation has only recently started to moderate from elevated levels.
Core inflation – that is, inflation excluding energy and food – provides another example of these lagged effects. Empirical analyses indicate that the contribution to core inflation of higher input costs stemming from supply chain disruptions and the energy shock only peaked last March (Chart 3). Furthermore, movements of producer prices influence retail prices with a delay of some months (Chart 4).[5]
But there have also been other factors at play.
The reopening of the economy after the pandemic provided a boost to consumption in the summer of last year, with a significant shift in demand towards services such as travel, hospitality and restaurants. These sectors faced labour shortages in a tight job market.
Such sectoral demand-supply imbalances, coupled with the uncertainty generated by high and volatile inflation, have in turn allowed some firms to raise their profit margins.[6]This is consistent with the conspicuous increase in profits in specific sectors, on the back of retail prices rising quickly despite wholesale prices falling.[7]
In this context, even though we were not facing generalised and sustained excess demand – or a significant reduction in production capacity[8]– we recalibrated our policy for three main reasons.
The first was to avoid monetary policy adding to inflation risks. With inflation accelerating, failure to adjust policy rates would have made monetary policy more accommodative when the opposite was needed.
The second was to anchor inflation expectations. Although inflation expectations did remain anchored, we needed to stem the risk of a de-anchoring in the face of persistently high inflation. De-anchoring inflation expectations would have made our disinflationary policy costlier, requiring higher policy rates to obtain the same real rate. It would also have increased the risk of a wage-price spiral, which would have been very costly to stop.[9]
The third reason was to contain the risks connected to the strength of the labour market. With the unemployment rate at a historical low of 6.4% in June, firms tended to retain their workforce in response to slowing growth rather than resort to layoffs.
This increased the risk that a phase of wage catch-up could turn into a self-sustained and destabilising process. Given that wages make up as much as 40% of input costs for service providers, and with services inflation accounting for almost two-thirds of core inflation,[10]we continue to closely monitor this risk.
The shifting balance of risks
These factors that were initially driving our actions have now diminished in intensity.
First, the process of disinflation has been set in motion, pushing inflation expectations down.
From March onwards, we have observed a consistent decline in consumer expectations for inflation over a 12-month horizon.[11]Likewise, firms’ expectations regarding their selling prices for the coming quarter have markedly decreased from their peak of last year (Chart 5).[12]
Moreover, long-term inflation expectations derived from surveys have remained largely stable.[13]This allays concerns about a wage-price spiral. And so far wage developments have been in line with our staff projections, which envisage inflation reverting to 2% by the end of 2025.
Second, as supply shocks recede, pipeline price pressures are diminishing, and the risks to inflation are becoming balanced. Supply chain pressures have substantially abated compared with last year. Commodity prices have fallen, although persistent upward pressures on energy and food prices due to geopolitical tensions and climatic events could reverse this trend (Charts 6 and 7).
Falling energy prices have already pushed headline inflation lower: energy inflation, which had surged to 44.3% in March 2022, is now in negative territory (Chart 8). And most effects of the unwinding supply shocks on non-energy inflation are yet to emerge. Services inflation is still rising, owing to robust spending on holidays and travel as well as base effects. It is important to monitor this inflation component and its implications for the risks to overall inflation. Underlying inflation is moderating[14]. Inflation pressures at the early stages of the price formation process are easing, with producer price inflation (PPI) declining further in recent months (Chart 9).
The proportion of items in the consumption basket that have a higher annual inflation rate compared with the previous quarter has fallen from a peak of 80% to less than 30% (Chart 10). Measures capturing the persistent and common component of inflation (PCCI) show increasing signs of softening (Chart 11).
Although core inflation is still elevated and is projected to remain around current levels throughout the summer,[15]empirical evidence suggests that it is a lagging – not a leading – indicator of inflation.[16]In other words, looking at core inflation today does not tell us much about where headline inflation will settle in the medium term. Just as higher energy prices seeped through the economy on the way up, they will also eventually do so on the way down.
Third, as the economic outlook deteriorates, the risks to economic activity are tilted to the downside. The “bullwhip effect” on inventories[17]seems to be reversing, contributing to a manufacturing recession. The downturn in the euro area manufacturing sector intensified in July, with the manufacturing PMI falling to its lowest level in over three years and prices charged by manufacturers falling at the steepest rate since 2009.[18]
The services sector continued to expand, but it did so at its slowest rate since the start of 2023, suggesting that the resurgence in services spending may be losing momentum.[19]The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index shows a divergence between the euro area and the United States, with the euro area registering mostly negative surprises in recent months (Chart 12).
Demand conditions in the euro area are likely to remain weak as the impact of monetary policy strengthens, governments unwind the fiscal policy measures they adopted in response to the energy crisis and the consumption impulse from excess savings fades.
If downside risks to growth persist and materialise, high wage growth is less likely to be sustained. The decline in inflation could contain wage demands, and high profits may help to absorb them. And if firms start to anticipate a drop in future demand and labour needs, the economic strength represented by firms’ tendency to hoard labour could turn into a vulnerability.
The path ahead for monetary policy
So, what does this mean for how we calibrate monetary policy?
The current juncture is particularly challenging, given that the effects of our past tightening are yet to be felt in full.
We have clear indications that our monetary policy is being transmitted strongly to monetary and credit conditions.
Money growth has fallen dramatically (Chart 13), and both nominal and real rates have increased considerably since the start of the tightening cycle.
In the credit market, both quantities and rates have reacted to our tightening much faster than in the past.
Our bank lending survey finds that firms’ demand for loans in the second quarter of 2023 was at its lowest level since the survey was first launched two decades ago, while the tightening of lending standards since the start of the hiking cycle has been very substantial. These indications are consistent with the ongoing sharp deceleration of credit aggregates (Chart 14).[20]Rates for loans to firms and households are now at their highest levels since the end of 2008 and summer 2012, respectively. Moreover, the transmission of the rate hikes to time deposits – an important source of funding for banks – has been considerably stronger in the euro area than in the United States (Chart 15).[21]
Given these developments, we must be prudent in calibrating our monetary policy stance if we are to reach our inflation target without harming economic activity unnecessarily.
It is possible that the transmission of our monetary policy might be even stronger than the staff projections indicate. The rapid increase in interest rates and the fast contraction in our balance sheet may lead to stronger effects on monetary and credit conditions, and eventually on the economy and inflation. In addition, the tightening of monetary policy is being amplified by international policy spillovers.[22]
In these circumstances, our disinflationary monetary policy may be conducted by combining different approaches. One approach – thelevelapproach – entails going higher than where the policy rate is currently, with the risk of then having to cut earlier and faster, as implicit in investors’ expectations about the future interest rate path. Another approach – thepersistenceapproach – instead advocates delivering the same degree of overall restriction while avoiding ups and downs, namely by keeping policy rates at the prevailing level for an extended period.
Emphasisingpersistencemay be particularly valuable in the current situation, where the policy rate is around the level necessary to deliver medium-term price stability, the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations is low, inflation risks are balanced and economic activity is weak. Under such conditions, relying solely on an aggressive approach to rate hikes might amplify the risk associated with overtightening, which could subsequently require rates to be cut hastily in a deteriorating economic environment.
Thepersistenceelement can mitigate this risk, giving the central bank more time to assess the lagged effects of its past policy measures and fine-tune the calibration of its stance as new information comes to light over time. This “breathing space” is crucial given that – as I said before – the transmission of our monetary policy may actually turn out to be stronger than our projections indicate.
Moreover, favouringpersistencewould be in line with our previous proportionate response to the evolving challenges to price stability. We initially prioritised acting swiftly, hiking rates in large steps to normalise our monetary policy stance. We communicated a clear upward path for interest rates to signal commitment to this objective and we brought rates to restrictive levels to address the risks that inflation could remain too high for too long. Later, we reduced the speed, aware of the diminishing distance to our target and the increasing risk of policy misjudgements.
However, emphasisingpersistencemight pose communication challenges. It might give rise to concerns about the effectiveness of our disinflationary policy. Or it might prompt worries that persistence could simply amount to delaying tangible actions, such as rate hikes, in favour of a strategy of keeping rates higher at a later stage – which eventually may or may not be internalised by investors in their anticipation of future policy.
Countering such misconceptions would require clear communication by the ECB. We need to explain that the same degree of restriction can be delivered with different combinations of rate levels and persistence.
In any case, thelevelapproach is not immune to communication problems. For example, under such an approach, a pattern of hiking followed by subsequent rate cuts could undermine the disinflationary impact of our policy if the yield curve inverts in anticipation.[23]But if market participants were to understand persistence as a key element of our policy, the risk of a yield curve inversion would fade.
By determining the duration of a specific policy rate on the basis of incoming data, we can use persistence as a dynamic stabiliser. This would enable us to flexibly adapt our stance based on evolving risks without having to take decisions that might then need to be reversed, at a high cost.
This adaptive methodology aligns seamlessly with our data-dependent approach. And of course, should the inflation outlook materially deteriorate, a further rate adjustment would be warranted.
There are also financial stability aspects to consider, to the extent that they may affect the smooth transmission of our monetary policy. They would be ill-served by aggressive policies that could lead to atypical configurations of the term structure and interfere with usual asset and liability management practices, possibly exposing some intermediaries to substantial interest rate risks.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Calibrating monetary policy has become increasingly complex.
We are at a juncture where inflation is falling, with fading supply shocks, but past monetary tightening has yet to be felt in full. With rates now in restrictive territory, monetary policy needs to be calibrated in a way that allows us to reach our inflation target in a timely manner while avoiding unnecessary costs to the economy.
So we need to get disinflation right.
To this end, when steering the monetary policy stance, persistence is becoming as important as the level of our policy rates. This is particularly true given that risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced, while risks to the economic outlook have shifted to the downside.
A stance that incorporates persistence offers greater scope to flexibly adjust our policy in light of the incoming data, while crucially leaving no room to waver in the fight against inflation. And indeed, let there be no doubt: we are fully committed to bringing inflation back to our target in a timely way."

Welcome address by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the 9th ECB conference on central, eastern and south-eastern European countries
Frankfurt am Main, 17 July 2023
It is a great pleasure to open the ninth ECB conference on central, eastern and south-eastern European countries.
The CESEE region – which comprises 21 different economies[1]– can overall be considered a European success story in recent decades, having enjoyed rapid convergence towards higher-income countries.
Between 2000 and 2021, the economic size of the region almost doubled to 40% of the euro area aggregate.[2]And this strong growth has led to rising living standards, with average GDP per capita jumping from 36% to 54% of the euro area aggregate in the same period.[3]
But the world has changed dramatically since we last held this conference in 2019. A series of shocks have upended our old reality and replaced it with new uncertainties.
Devastatingly, one of those shocks has been the outbreak of war in Europe – an event that we once thought consigned to the history books. Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people is a human tragedy. And it has had deep economic consequences for the CESEE region in particular.
In parallel, the world is changing in ways which make the growth models of many CESEE countries more vulnerable, as these models generally involve high levels of trade openness and integration into global value chains.
But as Graham Greene once wrote, a “feat of daring can alter the whole conception of what is possible.” And the challenge now facing the CESEE region is how to continue its convergence story and ensure that growth remains resilient in this new landscape.
Fortunately, CESEE economies can already look back on a strong history of resilience – be it mastering the transition from central planning to market economies in the 1990s or recovering from the global financial crisis with impressive speed.
I therefore have every confidence that they will be able to adapt to these new uncertainties.
A changing geopolitical landscape
There are two broad shifts reshaping the global economy that may have profound implications for the CESEE region: rising geopolitical tensions and weakening global trade.
After a long period in which the United States was the sole superpower, the world is becoming more multipolar, with greater competition between major powers, less respect for international rules and norms and a waning influence for multilateral institutions.
In this environment, even deep commercial ties may be insufficient to prevent trading relationships from becoming adversarial. This makes the global environment increasingly prone to shocks and the task of macroeconomic stabilisation for all countries much harder.
Unfortunately, the CESEE economies know this all too well.
Russia’s war against Ukraine triggered a massive shock to the global economy – especially to energy and food markets – and CESEE economies have been particularly exposed, given their geographic proximity to the conflict. While inflation has now started to come down, over two-thirds of economies in the CESEE region saw annual inflation hit 13% or above last year, with several countries seeing markedly higher price increases. By comparison, annual inflation in the euro area was 8.4%.
Geopolitical tensions risk accelerating the second shift in the global landscape: weakening global trade.
Since the global financial crisis, trade growth as a share of world GDP has plateaued.[4]And we are also seeing rising levels of protectionism as countries reconfigure their supply chains to align with new strategic goals. Over the last decade, the number of trade restrictions in place has increased tenfold.[5]
The CESEE region, and Europe more generally, may be vulnerable to such a shift. Last year, trade as a share of GDP was higher than the euro area average for two-thirds of CESEE economies. And while other major economies, such as the United States, have seen trade as a share of GDP fall since the pandemic, in the euro area it reached a record high in 2022.[6]
A new foundation for strengthening resilience
A changing geopolitical landscape means that, in the euro area and the CESEE region, we need to build a new foundation for strengthening resilience. This foundation rests on further deepening the European Union and its ties to the surrounding region. I see three key elements.
The first is reinforcing openness within our region.
Trade fragmentation could see the flow of goods and services increasingly being pulled towards different trade blocs, at the expense of countries outside those blocs. By leveraging our regional strength, Europe and the CESEE region can recreate some of the benefits of globalisation on a smaller scale.
The euro area is already the main trading partner for most CESEE economies. And we can capitalise on this existing momentum. Between the year 2000 and last year, the share of euro area imports from the CESEE region increased from 5% to 10%.[7]And the share of euro area exports to CESEE economies reached 11% last year, almost double that at the start of the millennium.[8]
Moreover, CESEE economies in particular can benefit from changing global trade patterns as companies seek suppliers closer to home. Survey evidence shows that firms in the CESEE region, and especially those based in the EU, are seen as highly reliable trading partners.[9]
The ECB also has a key role to play here as the guardian of the euro.
Our monetary policy plays an important anchoring role for the CESEE region, as the euro is widely used in trade invoicing and financing. Euro cash also serves as an important store of value – demand for it surged in CESEE economies following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[10]
The second key element is increasing our collective security.
Europe and the CESEE economies have already taken substantial steps to increase their energy security, given the dangerous historical reliance on Russian fossil fuels in their energy mix.
In February 2022, the EU was importing around 36% of its natural gas from Russia. Within the space of nine months, that fell sharply to 13% as the EU reduced its gas consumption and diversified towards imports of liquified natural gas.[11]Most, though not all, CESEE economies have also made significant progress in substituting energy imports away from Russia and in building up gas storage levels.
But we cannot stop there. We need to accelerate our efforts to decarbonise and increase our energy independence. That is why initiatives that help to build renewable energy sources are so important – such as Next Generation EU and the EU’s recent energy support package for countries in the Western Balkans.[12]
The third key element is defending and spreading our common values.
The attack on Ukraine was also an assault on European values – such as the respect for international law and human rights.
That is why Europe has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia and provided substantial support to Ukraine following the invasion. To date, the EU has made available €38.3 billion in economic assistance and over €21 billion in military support.[13]
The strength of the EU’s response demonstrates not only its capacity for action, but also its appeal as a political project that others see the benefit of joining – what the West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer once described as the “Magnet Europa” effect.[14]
The push for EU enlargement has recently gathered momentum as a consequence of Russia’s war. Last year, the EU granted Ukraine, Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status.[15]And it launched the process to open accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia, while also becoming open to granting Georgia the status of candidate country, conditional on reforms.[16]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
A series of shocks have dramatically changed the global landscape in recent years. And today, rising geopolitical tensions and weakening global trade mean that economies in the CESEE region need to build a new foundation of resilience.
But the record of past crises has already demonstrated just how resilient CESEE countries can be. Despite an exceptionally difficult 2022, the prospects for the CESEE region are encouraging. There are clear structural strengths that stand to benefit CESEE economies in the medium to long run, such as well-educated workforces and strong ties with Europe.
So the task at hand is how to channel that spirit of resilience to counteract these new uncertainties. And by leveraging our regional strength and further deepening our economic and political ties, I have no doubt that Europe and the economies in the CESEE region can flourish together.
Thank you – and I hope you enjoy today’s proceedings."

Remarks by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Panel Discussion on Banking Solvency and Monetary Policy, NBER Summer Institute 2023 Macro, Money and Financial Frictions Workshop
Cambridge, Massachusetts, 12 July 2023
Introduction
I will focus in this speech on the banking channel of monetary policy.[1]Starting in December 2021 with the announcement that net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) would end in March 2022, the ECB has been tightening its monetary policy stance in response to the extraordinary surge in inflation amid the pandemic shutdowns, supply bottlenecks and, most importantly, the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine.
For a given inflation outlook, the appropriate level and duration of a restrictive monetary policy stance depends on how powerfully and how quickly the economy responds to the tightening of monetary policy. In view of the predominant role of the banking system in credit provision in the euro area, how banks respond to monetary policy is a central issue in assessing the strength of the transmission mechanism. Accordingly, in our data-dependent approach to calibrating monetary policy, assessing the strength of the banking channel of monetary policy tightening is a first-order task for the ECB.
I will discuss some of the challenges in forming a quantitative assessment of monetary policy transmission via the banking channel.[2]First, I will briefly review the various channels through which banks affect the transmission process. Second, I will assess how the considerable amount of monetary policy tightening injected over the last year is being transmitted in the euro area.
The bank-based transmission of monetary policy
Monetary policy affects investment and consumption decisions by setting the level of market interest rates and thereby steering borrowing costs across all economic sectors: this is the “cost-of-capital” channel. When banks pass on changes in the policy rate to their borrowers, the real economy is affected via the investment and production plans of firms, as well as through the decisions of households to financing consumption and real estate. Since for many firms and households the interest rates that matter most are the lending rates and deposit rates set by banks, the pass-through of policy rates to bank lending and deposit rates is a basic step in monetary policy transmission.
In addition to the transmission via interest rates, there are amplification mechanisms that work via the cost, the availability, and the quality of credit and that are able to generate relatively large real effects even with relatively small monetary policy changes. The main amplification mechanisms operating via banks are the balance sheet channel, the bank lending channel and the risk-taking channel.
The balance-sheet channel of monetary policy predicts that a policy rate hike tends to compress asset prices and weaken activity, thus lowering the net worth of borrowers.[3]This translates into a reduced capacity to raise external funding for firms: the increase in the external finance premium faced by borrowers due to a decline in net worth and pledged collateral decreases spending and investment by more than what is predicted by a short-term policy rate change in a framework abstracting from the balance sheet channel. The same channel also affects households whose net worth is closely linked to house prices. The lower value of collateral during a policy tightening therefore triggers higher credit risk and tighter credit conditions for both firms and households.
The bank-lending channel focuses on the impact of policy tightening on the supply of bank loans to the economy. First, the supply of loans offered by banks is adversely affected by monetary policy tightening via an increase in bank funding costs.[4]Second, borrower-lender agency costs further reduce the willingness of banks to lend during periods of higher monetary policy rates or lower economic activity.[5]Third, bank balance sheet constraints amplify the contraction in credit availability brought about by policy tightening.[6]Broadly speaking, higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid assets – overnight deposits – compared with less liquid assets such as term deposits or securities. Moreover, the unwinding of asset purchases and long-term refinancing operations currently lead to a direct decline in the liquidity available to banks, limiting their capacity to supply credit.[7]
The third amplification mechanism is the risk-taking channel of monetary policy.[8]This is the channel through which banks are incentivised to make riskier investments in an environment of lower interest rates, which reduces incentives to engage in costly monitoring.[9]In addition, asset purchases programmes extract duration risk from the market, increasing the relative attractiveness of riskier investments and therefore triggering a portfolio rebalancing that ultimately leads to a reallocation towards real investments.[10]As such, during the period of highly accommodative monetary policy, this may have led banks to build up a stock of risky investments. The opposite dynamic may not be operating, as declining risk tolerance can lead to a contraction in the supply of credit.[11]
Each of the components of the banking channel can interact with each other and generate self-reinforcing mechanisms that further amplify the impact of the initial policy impulse on credit conditions. For instance, following a monetary policy tightening, decreased bank risk tolerance coupled with weaker borrower net worth may affect bank profitability and capital and therefore amplify supply constraints via the bank lending channel. Moreover, general equilibrium effects also interact with the bank lending channel. Strong economic conditions can provide countervailing factors that attenuate the impact of monetary policy, while weak macroeconomic conditions may amplify the strength of monetary policy tightening.[12]In particular, as aggregate demand falls in response to higher interest rates, banks face both lower demand for loans and a deterioration in borrower credit risk which further weigh on bank balance sheets. These additional factors may further strengthen the bank lending channel of monetary policy.
This brief review of the role of banks in monetary policy transmission has highlighted that the balance sheet channel, the bank lending channel, and the risk-taking channel may be relevant in the transmission of the current hiking cycle. In addition, amongst other mechanisms, the rise in bank funding costs and the drop in liquidity may lead to a contraction in credit supply, adversely affecting bank-dependent firms and households. Next, I will review the incoming evidence on the strength of monetary policy transmission via the banking system during the current tightening cycle.
Measuring the banking channel of monetary policy tightening
I now turn to an assessment of the incoming information on how the banking channel is operating during the current tightening cycle in the euro area. In June 2022, the ECB announced that it would start to increase its policy rates from July onwards. However, it had already started unwinding its highly accommodative monetary policy stance in December 2021, by announcing a step-by-step reduction in the pace of net asset purchases, which pushed up yields of longer-dated assets from early 2022 onwards.
Against the backdrop of the tightening of monetary policy, the pass-through to bank funding costs has proceeded rapidly, most notably for yields on bank bonds(Chart 1).[13]Deposit rates contained the rise in the interest rate expenses of banks during the initial phase of the tightening cycle. This initial sluggishness was in part driven by an atypical configuration of interest rates during the negative rates period, in which many banks kept deposit rates higher than the policy rate(Chart 2, right panel).After this initial period, interest rates on term deposits have followed the policy rate, while the remuneration of overnight deposits has remained lower. Overall, these patterns were also seen in past periods of positive interest rates(Chart 2, left panel).
The limited increase in overnight deposit rates has incentivised depositors to rebalance their portfolios towards time deposits, after the prolonged period of low interest rates and low term premia in which the opportunity cost of holding overnight deposit had been negligible. Comparing developments in the euro area and the United States, while the pass-through to overnight deposit rates is limited in both jurisdictions, the transmission to time deposits has been considerably stronger in the euro area(Chart 2).[14]
In addition to the increases in the key policy interest rates, the gradual unwinding of the asset purchase programme (APP) and the phase-out of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) have also played a role in the transmission of monetary policy through banks.[15]In February this year, we moved to partial reinvestments under the APP before fully ending reinvestments in July. The ensuing decline in bonds held by the Eurosystem reduces the amount of duration extraction associated with the outstanding bond portfolio, and thereby increases term premia. The resulting increase in long-term interest rates pushes up the pricing of bank loans, ultimately increasing lending rates for firms and households. In addition, the higher yields on bonds increase their attractiveness as an investment for banks, reducing their incentives to supply loans.
The phase out of TLTRO III has led banks to partially substitute TLTRO loans with more expensive sources of funding. While a large share of the voluntary early repayments at the end of last year and early this year was financed out of outstanding excess liquidity, banks have been more recently raising alternative funding to cover maturing TLTRO loans, in particular in light of the large amount which matured in June. The need to replace TLTRO funding requires the issuance of more costly bonds and leads to greater competition in deposit markets to attract funding. Furthermore, the recalibration of TLTRO in October 2022 increased the cost of TLTRO borrowing, and restored incentives for voluntary early repayments. The resulting increase in bank funding costs put upward pressure on lending rates and downward pressure on credit supply.
Moreover, the winding down of both the TLTROs and the asset purchases has contributed to a rapid reduction in the central bank excess liquidity available to banks. The combined effect of this outright reduction in liquidity adds downward pressure on the supply of credit by banks, as already evident in survey data (Chart 3). In contrast to the expansion phase, banks now report that the ECB monetary policy asset portfolio and the TLTRO III programme are associated with lower expected lending volumes, as well as tighter expected credit standards and more restrictive terms and conditions.
Turning to the lending rates for firms, the pass-through of tighter monetary policy to overall financing conditions has been strong. Higher bank funding costs translated into a strong increase in lending rates to non-financial corporations, although spreads relative to risk-free rates were somewhat compressed. Lending rates started to increase in June 2022 ahead of the first ECB rate hike. Compared with past hiking cycles, the current campaign has seen the most prominent lending rate increase in the euro area – in terms of both speed and magnitude, also reflecting the unprecedented speed and magnitude of policy rate increases(Chart 4).
At the same time, loan volumes in the euro area have weakened sharply starting from the end of 2022. Credit flows have remained stagnant on aggregate for loans and bonds, with some substitution between the two sources of financing(Chart 5, left panel).The weakening in credit has been stronger than in past hiking cycles and, while this is partly driven by the unprecedented pace of policy tightening, a model-based simulation confirms that loan volumes turned around faster than what would have been expected based on historical regularities, given the path of monetary policy hikes since December 2021(Chart 5, right panel).
The current tightening cycle has been broadly synchronised among major advanced economies but the downturn in lending dynamics has been starker in the euro area than in the United States, despite the later start of the hiking cycle and smaller magnitude of rate hikes to date (Chart 6, right panel). In both the euro area and the United States, the weakening of loan volumes was associated with a strong tightening of credit standards, as reported by banks in the euro area Bank Lending Survey (BLS), and in the US Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) (Chart 6, left panel). This evidence points to tighter loan supply in both economies. This tightening combines the reversal of previously highly accommodative conditions and the further shift into more restrictive territory in recent times.
Of course, loan volumes and lending rates are the product of both credit demand and credit supply forces. Establishing the respective contributions is crucial to understand the underlying sources of credit fluctuations, even if the underlying credit demand and credit supply schedules are unobservable. While the evidence from surveys and aggregate data is useful in showing in which direction credit conditions are travelling more broadly, confounding factors might pose difficulties in interpreting aggregate measures. Indeed, looking at historical regularities, there is a clear positive correlation between lower bank-level loan demand and the tightening of credit standards. This is due to several factors. For instance, firms may ask for fewer loans when their expectations on the economy deteriorate. This may lead to an overestimation of the role of credit supply if credit demand is not properly estimated. At the same time, banks may informally discourage their clients from applying for loans and therefore not explicitly reject them. In this case, considering only the part of credit supply that is not related to credit demand would be an overly conservative approach that captures only part of the actual change in credit supply.
Increased cost of market-based financing and the phase-out of TLTROs has led to a contraction in bank credit supply(Chart 7, left panel).Empirical analysis that uses granular datato control for broader demand conditions and thereby extracts a pure supply shock finds that both the reduction in TLTRO funds and the increase in bank bond yields lead to a significant reduction in loan supply. Specifically, the empirical estimates suggest that the decline in TLTROsince the recalibration in October 2022 reduced quarterly loan growth by about 0.5 percentage points, while the average increase in bank bond yields since the first rate hike in July 2022 led to a 1.1 percentage point lower quarterly loan growth.
The role of credit supply can also be isolated by using soft information from surveys. Individual replies to the Bank Lending Survey can be used to construct a Loan Supply Indicator (LSI) that purges credit standards from changes in loan demand and prevailing macroeconomic conditions(Chart 7, right panel).[17]This indicator allows us to gauge how much of the observed slowdown in credit conditions is due to supply effects over and above the impact of monetary policy on credit demand. The indicator shows a marked contraction in loan supply since the start of the tightening cycle. This shift in loan supply conditions is even more remarkable in view of the highly accommodative loan supply environment in the years before the pandemic.
Credit supply restrictions typically lead to a significant drop in real economic activity.Augmenting a macro-financial empirical model with the LSI indicates that a credit supply shock leading to a 1 percentage point decline in loan volumes results in a 0.3 percentage point reduction in real GDP(Chart 8). A meta-analysis shows that this quantification is in line with the results of other empirical studies that use different models and cover different sample periods and jurisdictions. Overall, the results indicate that a credit supply shock leads to a contraction in the volume of credit intermediated by banks that in turn generates a substantial reduction in output, compared to the baseline path.
Factors affecting the strength of the banking channel
Let me now discuss potential factors that in the current environment can either attenuate or amplify the banking channel of monetary policy, starting with three specific characteristics of this policy cycle.
First, the current tightening consists of both permanent and temporary components. On the one hand, it involved the unwinding of the extraordinarily supportive monetary policy measures that were in place since 2014 in order to combat chronic below-target inflation and mitigate the downside risks during the pandemic. In the absence of new shocks that would drive the economy back towards the lower bound, the policy rate is expected to settle at around two per cent in the medium term and extraordinary measures such as large-scale quantitative easing and targeted lending programmes are not expected to be re-introduced. It follows that this normalisation component is expected to be essentially permanent in nature. On the other hand, the hike of policy rates into restrictive territory during the first half of this year reflects a more temporary component of the tightening cycle. While the ECB will set policy rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for sufficiently long to ensure a timely return of inflation to our medium-term two per cent target, the restrictive component of monetary policy will ultimately be unwound in order to stabilise inflation at our target rather than unleashing a subsequent phase of chronically below-target inflation.[19]Before the surge in inflation, it had been widely expected that the “low for long” policy configuration would have persisted for several more years. Hence, the permanent component of the current tightening cycle might amplify the banking channel compared to other tightening episodes which only featured a purely cyclical tightening. In particular, banks may more extensively re-assess credit supply policies in reaction to the permanent shift in the underlying monetary policy stance.
Second, the current environment of ample liquidity alters the mechanics of the monetary tightening relative to previous tightening cycles that took place within policy frameworks in which the banking system operated with a structural liquidity deficit. While the ECB balance sheet is shrinking, the de facto operational framework for monetary policy is still underpinned by ample liquidity whereby the deposit facility rate determines money market conditions.[20]The movement of the DFR into positive territory may induce a “cold potato” effect, in that banks are incentivised to hold on to funds as the DFR is now positive, contrasting with the period of negative interest rates.[21]At the same time, the significant decline in excess liquidity as a result of the contraction in the ECB balance sheet may lead to greater heterogeneity in money market conditions, especially since the distribution of the excess liquidity is uneven across banks. In turn, this means that the responses to rate hikes are likely to be increasingly heterogeneous across euro area banks and across member countries, with associated implications for the overall impact of monetary policy tightening on the aggregate euro area economy.[22]
Third, the strength of the banking channel of monetary policy plausibly differs across supply-driven and demand-driven inflationary episodes. The fading of a temporary demand shock is associated with lower incomes and output, amplifying the transmission of monetary policy through the banking channel. In contrast, the fading out of temporary supply shocks boosts incomes and supply capacity. Currently, this is the case for the reversal of the surge in energy prices, the easing of supply chain bottlenecks, as well as the post-pandemic re-normalisation of sectoral supply and demand conditions. In one direction, the unwinding of a temporary supply shock puts downward pressure on inflation, reducing the scale of monetary tightening that is required to return inflation to the medium-term target in a timely manner.[23]In the other direction, the recovery in incomes attenuates some of the transmission mechanisms via the banking sector, which should also be taken into account in the calibration of monetary policy.
We can turn to asking which factors can affect the effectiveness of our monetary policy, through these various channels. In general, all else equal, there has been a substantial reduction in financial tail risks on account of the improvements in the balance sheets of firms and households that were generated by pandemic-related fiscal transfers and the excess savings accumulated during pandemic shutdowns. The curtailment of tail risks means that monetary policy is more likely to transmit in an orderly manner, rather than be disrupted by the emergence of systemic financial stress. Indeed, the health of the balance sheets of euro area firms and households is reflected in the only-limited deterioration in borrower defaults observed so far in this tightening cycle.
For firms, in addition to the aggregate improvement in balance sheets, relatively high profits over the last year and elevated liquid holdings could act as possible countervailing factors. However, there is substantial variation across firms. The data show that the firms with higher profit growth and higher accumulated cash tend to be those with relatively lower leverage. In other words, the aforementioned possible mitigating factors would not benefit firms that most need them: highly leveraged firms still remain exposed to credit tightening. Moreover, the expected moderation of firm profits over time could strengthen transmission.
In addition, granular data suggest that younger and smaller firms have been disproportionately affected by the decline in bank lending(Chart 9).Historically, such firms have been the first to suffer contractionary credit supply shocks. The more substantial contraction of lending dynamics for young and small firms can be interpreted as an indicator of a broader credit supply tightening, where banks start protecting their balance sheets against a deterioration of the payment capacity of borrowers. Given the risk of adverse selection, banks opt to reduce credit supply volumes rather than simply raise lending rates.[24]Furthermore, the finding that smaller firms have seen a larger tightening of credit standards is particularly relevant in view of the central role that SMEs play in the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area, particularly through the bank lending channel. Such firms, which account for a large share of employment in the euro area, tend to be more reliant on banks for lending and thus are more likely to experience funding shocks when banks restrict supply.[25]
In assessing the impact of monetary policy tightening on both broader credit risks and the funding environment, the growing interconnections between non-bank financial intermediaries and the euro area banking system require close monitoring.[26]These links account for nine percent of total assets and 14 per cent of total liabilities of significant banks in the euro area on average. It follows that shocks to the non-bank financial sector could increase the credit risks and/or the funding costs of the euro area banking system. In particular, since higher interest rates broadly reduce the value of assets held by non-bank financial intermediaries and increase the funding costs of firms that are dependent on market-based financing, these interconnections represent an important channel through which monetary policy tightening affects the euro area banking system. Furthermore, since non-banks have become increasingly significant credit providers in recent years (especially in some market segments), a contraction in credit supply by non-banks should be incorporated in an overall assessment of monetary transmission, in addition to credit supply intermediated by banks.[27]
On the household side, the changing composition of household balance sheets may affect the strength of the transmission of monetary tightening via banks.In one direction, gross debt to income ratios, which measure debt servicing capacity, are now higher than in the 2000 and the 2005 tightening episodes, which would tend to strengthen transmission(Chart 10). In the other direction, there is a now a higher share of fixed rate mortgages across the euro area, which could reduce the speed of transmission through the cash-flow channel. However, looking at how the current rate increases have translated into higher rates on the stock of mortgages, the difference relative to the past hikes does not seem substantial. In other words, there is no evidence of a more muted pass-through of higher rates to overall mortgage lending.
In relation to the interconnection between housing markets and the banking channel, residential property makes up a high portion of household wealth. Data for the first quarter of 2023 show a marked slowdown in the annual growth rate of nominal house prices for the aggregate euro area and outright nominal price declines in some countries.[28]Reflecting this, the contribution of changes in real estate asset holdings towards the growth in household net worth has declined. The adverse impact of declining asset values on household net worth suggests a more powerful balance sheet channel, with banks more reluctant to offer mortgages or other credit to home-owning households.
Looking more broadly at household balance sheets, households in the aggregate now hold much higher stocks of liquid financial assets. However, the real value of money holdings has been eroded through inflation, while capital losses have been incurred on bond holdings. Despite this, data for the first quarter saw a rebound in the annual growth rate of the net worth of the household, partially driven by improvements in equity prices during the quarter. In terms of distribution across households, liquid financial assets are mostly owned by higher-income households, such that many households cannot draw down liquid financial assets to counter-balance any pressure through debt channels.
Moving to the bank lending channel, bank capital and liquidity positions, as well as the duration of their asset portfolios, affect the strength of transmission. Ample capital and liquidity buffers, high profitability and appropriate credit risk management are important to maintain the orderly transmission of monetary policy. Indeed, these factors enabled the euro area banking system to withstand the market turmoil of March 2023 without a severe dislocation of credit supply. In general, compared to the past, financial stability risks are now more closely monitored by prudential authorities and are also subject to increasing market scrutiny.[29]Therefore, the actual realisation of financial stress is now less likely compared to a counter-factual in which banks had much lower capital and liquidity positions.[30]At the same time, since this is in part due to a more cautious attitude of banks to emerging risks, it may contribute to a reduction in credit supply when faced with a sustained weakening of borrower creditworthiness.
Similarly, a longer duration of the bond portfolios of banks could translate into higher unrealised losses from the fall in bond prices, which may amplify the tightening of monetary policy.[31]As downward pressure on bank profits from these unrealised losses cumulates and aggregate deposit volumes decrease, banks become increasingly exposed to a tighter liquidity environment and need to step up efforts to secure their deposit bases. Alongside this, while increased competition on deposit rates encourages transmission on one side (in relation to dampening demand by households and firms by making it more attractive to hold deposits), there may be an acceleration of the pass-through of the interest rate hikes to deposit rates and broader funding conditions to levels incompatible with the target deposit betas of banks. Such deposit betas underpin the asset and liability management choices of banks and commitment to investors, and thus a stronger pass-through may translate into increased perceived banking sector risk and a further reduction in credit supply.
The strength of the risk-taking channel is underpinned by the higher risk perceptions around the macroeconomic outlook and the lower risk tolerance of individual banks. Increasing concerns about the credit worthiness of individual borrowers may test the ability of banks to meet capital targets, inducing a retrenchment from private sector credit. According to the BLS, risk perceptions continue to be an important driver of the tightening in credit standards. In part, this can reflect a reversal of the impact of the risk-taking channel during the accommodative phases of monetary policy, as risk tolerance declines and risk perceptions remain elevated. Lower liquidity on the back of the contraction in the ECB balance sheet compounds this tightening pressure by removing the leeway of banks to rely on outstanding liquidity to meet existing financial obligations and shoulder idiosyncratic shocks. Even the net interest income of banks, which has expanded substantially since the start of the tightening cycle and has supported the overall profitability of banks, levelled off in the first quarter of this year, amid a stabilisation in intermediation margins and the stagnation in credit volumes. Exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) may also lead to an amplification of monetary policy transmission, particularly if values fall in a sustained manner. Increasing funding costs put additional pressure on this sector, which was already vulnerable due to the impact of changing working patterns on the demand for office space.[32]Moreover, falling CRE asset values would lead to a decline in borrower creditworthiness and collateral values, leaving banks exposed to losses in the event of default. This could drive further declines in lending supply, potentially leading to a financial accelerator effect if such firms are particularly financially constrained. It should be noted that despite increased CRE risks in the euro area, these are less severe than in the United States, with vacancy rates for euro area CRE lower than those in the United States.
Let me conclude this part with two higher-level considerations on the strength of monetary transmission via the banking system. First, given the global nature of increased inflation, the ECB is not alone in increasing policy rates and there are spillovers from the global rate hikes to euro area banks. In particular, we should see spillovers from hikes by the Federal Reserve and other global central banks to the funding costs and liquidity of globally active euro area banks, potentially further amplifying the bank lending channel through global tightening.[33]Second, while the resilience of the euro area economy may have limited the severity of the credit supply channel by boosting the incomes of firms and households, a downturn or reversal of these factors would amplify the current slowdown in credit. In particular, as the cumulative tightening in monetary policy gains further traction, the countervailing impact of these factors will plausibly decline, with fading profits or a slowdown in household incomes amplifying the impact of the credit channel.
Conclusions
The banking channel is likely to further strengthen in the coming months. The typical lags in monetary transmission mean that the full economic impact of the considerable monetary tightening over the last year will only play out over the next couple of years. In relation to the banking channel, transmission will continue to strengthen with the ongoing repricing of bank funding, while the repricing of maturing fixed-rate loans will place further upward pressure on aggregate lending rates. The decline in liquidity due to the further repayment of TLTRO funds and the shrinking of the APP portfolio will further strengthen transmission via the banking channel in the coming months. Furthermore, any deterioration in the macroeconomic environment would also reinforce the banking channel by reducing loan demand and increasing credit risks. Non-linear amplification effects could materialise in the event that financial stress emerges either in the euro area or abroad.
Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor the strength of the banking channel through a range of indicators that draw on both hard and soft information. As part of our broad assessment of the banking channel, we examine a wide array of indicators on lending conditions, through information on bank balance sheets, the evolution of lending and deposit rates and survey-based measures. Our assessment is driven both by incoming data, but also broader modelling of bank lending conditions to create a forward-looking assessment. We combine macro-level data examining aggregate euro area credit developments and micro-level data that allows for variation across banks and different sectors of lending. The BLS plays a key role in our analysis, since it allows us to separate the demand and supply components of credit developments. The April BLS indicated that the net percentage of banks that further tightened their credit standards on loans to firms in the first quarter was 27 per cent, while the net percentage of banks reporting a decline in demand was 38 per cent. These results highlight the role that both credit demand and credit supply are playing during the current tightening cycle. The imminent July BLS will provide fresh information on the recent evolution of credit demand and credit supply, while the banks will also report their expectations for credit demand and credit supply for the coming months. Accordingly, in combination with the broader banking, financial and economic incoming data, the July BLS will help us to update our assessment of the banking channel of monetary policy tightening."

Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at King’s College London
London, 7 July 2023
Introduction
Thank you very much for inviting me here today to give the keynote speech on inflation.[1]Over the past two years inflation has surged across the globe, with the euro area being no exception. To be able to deliver on their mandates, monetary policymakers must understand its root causes, dynamics as well as possible knock-on effects.
My comments today will focus on the current inflationary environment in the euro area and the ECB’s monetary policy response. I will start by giving you a brief overview of how we got to where we are today and how we see the outlook for growth and inflation developing over the coming years. I will then take a more in-depth look at the main drivers of inflation, focusing on how they have evolved over the course of the pandemic and more recently. Finally, I will turn to the ECB’s monetary policy response so far.
The outlook for inflation and growth in the euro area
At the onset of the current inflation surge, the euro area economy was hit by a succession of extraordinary adverse supply shocks which pushed inflation far above the ECB’s 2% medium-term target. The COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 led to the enforced closure of large parts of the economy and a sharp drop in activity levels and inflation. As the consumer goods industry reopened and consumption patterns shifted from contact-intensive services to goods, supply and demand mismatches emerged. Bottlenecks slowed the supply of key intermediate inputs.[2]The decisive monetary and fiscal support measures that were put in place during the early stages of the pandemic protected people’s livelihoods, offered support to households and firms and counteracted the deflationary impact of the pandemic during the second half of 2020 and in the first half of 2021.
Then came Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Europe’s dependence on gas and food imports from the region led to an acute energy crisis and a significant negative terms-of-trade shock. Since then Europe has managed to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and avoided both energy rationing and a sharp contraction in activity. The gradual reversal of this shock is supporting economic growth and slowly reducing price pressures. But as the war is still ongoing, the risk of further upward pressure on commodity prices remains.
The recovery in demand, combined with supply disruptions, has made it easier for firms to pass on high input costs to consumer prices and for workers to negotiate higher wages.[3]This increases the risk of significant second-round effects.
The euro area economy has broadly stagnated in recent quarters as high prices and tighter financing conditions have weighed on household spending and private investment. Manufacturing activity has been hit particularly hard, while the services sector continues to benefit from the momentum generated from the reopening of the economy.
The labour market, meanwhile, has remained resilient. Almost 3.5 million jobs have been added since the start of 2022, largely thanks to an expanding labour force, with unemployment registering historical lows during the past year and reaching 6.5% in May 2023.
Although still too high, inflation fell from its peak of 10.6% in October last year, initially driven by a drop in energy inflation, to 5.5% in June, according to the Eurostat’s flash estimate. Inflation excluding energy and food – often referred to as core inflation – has been more persistent. It started to moderate only recently, declining to 5.3% in May, but it is estimated to have ticked up slightly to 5.4% in June.
In June, Eurosystem staff revised down slightly the outlook for growth in the euro area for the next two years. The economy is expected to slow to 0.9% in 2023 before rebounding to 1.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025 as energy prices moderate, foreign demand strengthens and real incomes improve. At the same time, the ECB’s monetary policy tightening is increasingly feeding through to the real economy while fiscal support is gradually withdrawn.
Inflation is projected to continue to slow as energy prices fall, food inflation moderates and supply bottlenecks ease. Eurosystem staff now see headline inflation decreasing from 8.4% in 2022 to 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain strong. Staff have revised up their projections for inflation excluding energy and food, owing to past upward surprises and the implications of a robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. They now see it reaching 5.1% on average in 2023 before declining to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025.
The anatomy of inflation
The drivers of inflation today are very different in type and magnitude from those in play before the pandemic as could be suspected in view of the recent unprecedentedly high inflation rates.[4]
Energy prices have been the most important driver of both the previous surge and the current decline in inflation. Recovering global demand drove the initial rise in commodity prices over the course of 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 pushed up commodity prices further, leading to an energy inflation rate of 44.3% year on year in March 2022, unprecedented in euro area history. Food inflation was also affected; it reached a historic high of 15.5% in March of this year. These developments have hit lower income households particularly hard owing to the significant share of energy and food in their consumption basket.
During the pandemic, the rotation of consumption away from services towards goods, combined with supply bottlenecks, resulted in severe demand-supply mismatches. This set in motion an inflationary impulse which pushed durable goods inflation to historically high levels.[5]More recently, goods inflation fell to 5.5% in June from its peak of 6.8% in February 2023. This reflects the easing of global supply shocks, as well as the impact of our monetary policy tightening on interest-sensitive components of demand, such as durable goods consumption.
Although services inflation eased slightly in May, it has been on an upward trajectory since mid-2021, reaching 5.4% in June.[6]The persistence in services inflation reflects that some cost pressures and reopening effects are still passing through. At the same time, rising wages are adding inflationary pressure to labour-intensive services. The reopening of the economy after the pandemic resulted in a strong resurgence of pent-up demand for contact-intensive services in particular, such as restaurants and travel related-items.
Overall, the pass-through from the recent supply shocks to underlying prices has been faster and more widespread than before the pandemic. This likely reflects both the unprecedented size and duration of the shocks which, combined with economic dislocations and significant labour shortages, allowed firms to pass higher input costs on to consumers. In an attempt to rebuild purchasing power, workers continue to push for higher wages.[7]
Given these unprecedented economic shocks, projecting key macroeconomic variables has proven challenging. This is particularly true for headline inflation, which has seen significant forecast errors by major professional forecasters, central banks and policy institutions since the start of the pandemic. Disentangling the “signal” on headline inflation from the “noise” has become increasingly difficult.[8]Underlying inflation measures have therefore become an important pillar in assessing the inflation outlook and risks.[9]These measures aim to capture more persistent price developments (for instance, by excluding more volatile items from headline inflation) to provide a clearer signal for medium-term inflation developments.
However, a key challenge is that the standard set of measures of underlying inflation continue to be contaminated by past energy shocks, supply disruptions and reopening dynamics. Since the start of the pandemic, the accuracy of both headline and core inflation projections one or two years ahead has in fact deteriorated significantly. Each indicator has its advantages and disadvantages and the performance of different measures can change over time. It is therefore important to monitor a wide range of indicators of underlying inflation.[10]
That said, there are currently two clear messages. First, while underlying price pressures remain strong, most indicators have started to show some signs of softening. Second, while still wide by historical standards, the range of measures of underlying inflation recently began to narrow. This suggests that the unusually high level of uncertainty around the downward trajectory of inflation over the medium term has started to ease somewhat. A closer look at some of these indicators however, reveals that some are levelling off only recently.
As the indirect effects of past energy price shocks and other pipeline price pressures gradually fade,labour costs – an important component of prices in the services sector – are becoming a dominant driver of inflation. Wage pressures are rising and we have factored strong wage growth into our inflation projections. Compensation per employee rose by 5.2% year on year in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to continue to grow strongly in the coming months. At the same time, firms in some sectors (such as trade, transport, accommodation and food) increased their profits, especially where demand outstripped supply.[11]Looking ahead, this may offer firms room to absorb the impact of wage increases on prices as other input costs moderate. The June 2023 Eurosystem staff projections assume a downward trajectory for firms’ profit margins along these lines. Given the crucial role of labour costs in the outlook, we are closely monitoring inflation dynamics in the services sector where these costs play a particularly important role.
The ECB’s monetary policy response
In response to the extraordinary surge in inflation since 2021, the ECB began to considerably tighten its monetary policy stance in several phases to make sure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. In December 2021 we announced that we would start normalising monetary policy by reducing the pace of net asset purchases. We decided to end net purchases in the first half of 2022, first under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and then under the asset purchase programme (APP). In July 2022 we began raising the key ECB interest rates, and we have since raised the deposit facility rate by a cumulative 400 basis points to 3.5%. Finally, to support the overall monetary policy stance, the Governing Council started to reduce the APP portfolio in March by only partially replacing maturing securities held therein, and reinvestments under the programme were discontinued as of this month.
We expect the transmission of our monetary policy tightening to operate across the entire yield curve.[12]The recent increases in policy rates affect the very short-term money market rates directly, while expectations of future policy rate changes lead to rising medium to long-term interest rates. At the same time, the rundown of our securities portfolio and changes in expectations of our holdings also push up long-term yields by increasing the duration risk that investors must hold. Due to these higher interest rates, households are expected to save more and consume less, while firms tend to reduce investments. Together, these effects lead to a cooling in aggregate demand that eventually feeds into lower inflation.
The bulk of the impact of our tightening is expected to materialise only in the course of this year and thereafter. Model estimates by ECB staff suggest that, owing to the tightening, inflation in 2022 was only half a percentage point lower than it would have otherwise been, while the downward impact is expected to average two percentage points over the period 2023-25.[13]
These model-based estimates provide a useful benchmark for assessing the strength of monetary policy transmission. However, during periods of elevated uncertainty or when policy is tightened quickly, transmission may differ in ways that are difficult to capture using models based on historical regularities. There may also be important non-linear dynamics – such as risks of inflation expectations becoming de-anchored or risks of financial effects being propagated more forcefully – that are not captured by linear models. For these reasons, models must be complemented by real-time monitoring of the transmission of policy to financial variables as well as leading indicators of prices and economic activity.
Given the unprecedented nature of the shocks that are working their way through the economy, as well as the uncertainty around the strength and speed of the impact of past rate hikes on inflation, we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction.
This data dependence works via the three rate-setting criteria that the Governing Council laid out in March 2023. Our future policy rate decisions will be based on (i) the assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission. It is important to note that these three criteria are equally important and provide cross-checks for the Governing Council in assessing the overall level and duration of restriction that will be necessary to achieve our objective.
Our June projections confirmed that, while inflation has moderated, it is expected to remain above our 2% target for too long. Although underlying price pressures are moderating, they remain strong and confirm the upward revision to both headline and core inflation. Nevertheless, the transmission of our unprecedented policy rate hikes so far to tighter financing conditions is well advanced and we are now beginning to see the impact on parts of the real economy.
Conclusion
To conclude, a succession of unprecedented shocks over the past three years has pushed inflation far above target in the euro area and around much of the world. The ECB’s Governing Council has responded by increasing interest rates substantially and has so far raised the policy rates by 400 basis points since July last year – the fastest tightening on record. But our job is not yet done. Services inflation, and labour costs in particular, need to be closely monitored, as they are now an important driver of overall inflation.
The current high inflation environment requires that monetary and fiscal policy work in the same direction. As energy prices fall and risks around the energy supply recede, it is important that the energy-related government support measures are rolled back to prevent that these drive up medium-term inflationary pressures.
Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary.
As the shocks reverse and the effects of our past rate increases are gradually transmitted across the real economy, inflation is projected to decline further towards our target. Nevertheless, the inflation outlook is surrounded by significant uncertainty, and we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the ECB Forum on Central Banking 2023 on “Macroeconomic stabilisation in a volatile inflation environment” in Sintra, Portugal
Sintra, 27 June 2023
Inflation in the euro area is too high and is set to remain so for too long. But the nature of the inflation challenge in the euro area is changing.
We are seeing a decline in the inflation rate as the shocks that originally drove up inflation wane and our monetary policy actions are transmitted to the economy. But the pass-through of those shocks is still ongoing, making the decline in inflation slower and the inflation process more persistent.
This persistence is caused by the fact that inflation is working its way through the economy in phases, as different economic agents try to pass the costs on to each other. And while it has been anticipated for some time in our staff projections, we have revised our assessment as new data have come in.
Monetary policymakers need to address this dynamic decisively to ensure that it does not lead to a self-fulfilling spiral fed by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.
So, the key question we face today is: how can we break this persistence?
In the ECB’s Governing Council, we have been clear that two elements of our policy stance will be key: we will have to bring rates to “sufficiently restrictive” levels and keep them there “for as long as necessary”.
Both elements are affected by uncertainty about the persistence of inflation and about the strength of the transmission of monetary policy to inflation.
Setting the right “level” and “length” will be critical for our monetary policy as we continue our tightening cycle.
In my remarks today, I will explore why the inflation process has become more persistent and what this implies for our policy stance.
My intention is not to signal any future decisions, but rather to frame the issues that monetary policy will face in the period ahead.
The inflation shock
The euro area economy has faced a series of overlapping inflationary shocks since the end of the pandemic.[1]Since the beginning of 2022, these shocks have both raised the price level by 11% and led to us transferring more than €200 billion to the rest of the world in the form of a terms of trade tax.[2]
In an environment such as this, the natural reaction of every economic agent is to try to pass on these price increases to other actors in the economy. In the euro area, we can identify two distinct phases in this process.
The first phase was led by firms, which reacted to steeply rising input costs by defending their margins and passing on the cost increases to consumers.
The intensity of this reaction was unusual. During previous terms-of-trade shocks in the euro area, firms had tended to absorb rising costs in profit margins, as slower growth made consumers less willing to tolerate price hikes.[3]But the special conditions we experienced last year turned this regularity on its head.
The sheer scale of input cost growth made it harder for consumers to judge whether price hikes were caused by higher costs or higher profits, fuelling a faster and stronger pass-through. At the same time, pent-up demand in reopening sectors, excess savings, expansionary policies and supply restrictions brought on by bottlenecks gave firms more scope to test consumer demand with higher prices.
For this reason, unit profits contributed around two-thirds to domestic inflation[4]in 2022, whereas in the previous 20 years their average contribution had been around one-third.[5]This in turn led to the shocks feeding into inflation much more quickly and forcefully than in the past.
This first phase is however now starting to wane.
Largely thanks to lower energy prices, year-on-year producer price inflation has already dropped by 42 percentage points from its peak last summer. And while this is taking time to feed through to prices more generally, it is partly being reflected in a broad-based decline in headline inflation and a levelling off in some measures of underlying inflation – especially exclusion-based measures and those that capture the persistent effects of energy on economy-wide prices.
At the same time, high inflation has eaten into domestic demand, which contracted by 2% over the last two quarters[6], and the consumption impulse created by excess savings is fading.[7]The early effects of our policy tightening are also becoming visible, especially in sectors like manufacturing and construction that are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Faced with this combination – falling input costs and dwindling demand – we saw unit profit growth slow markedly in most sectors in the first quarter of this year.
A more persistent inflation process
But the second phase of the inflation process is now starting to become stronger.
Workers have so far lost out from the inflation shock, seeing large real wage declines, which is triggering a sustained wage “catch-up” process as they try to recover their losses. This is pushing up other measures of underlying inflation that capture more domestic price pressures – particularly measures of wage-sensitive inflation and domestic inflation.
And since wage bargaining in many European countries is multi-annual and inertial, this process will naturally play out over several years. In our latest projections, we expect wages to grow by a further 14% between now and the end of 2025 and to fully recover their pre-pandemic level in real terms.
While this “catch up” has long been factored into our inflation outlook, the effect on inflation from rising wages has recently been amplified by lower productivity growth than we had previously projected, which is leading to higher unit labour costs. Alongside past upward surprises, this is a key reason why we recently revised up our projections for core inflation, even though our expectations for wages remained broadly the same.
Two features of the current business cycle are contributing to this dynamic – and both could linger, too.
The first is the resilience of employment relative to GDP growth.
Typically, we would have expected slowing economic growth over the last year to have somewhat reduced employment growth. But for the last three quarters in particular, the labour market has been performing better than an “Okun’s law”-based regularity would suggest.
That disconnect partly reflects increased labour hoarding by firms in a context of labour shortages, which is visible in the current gap between total hours worked and average hours worked.[8]This is weighing on productivity growth and, with unemployment expected to fall slightly further over the projection horizon, the motivation for firms to hoard labour may not disappear quickly.
The second feature contributing to weaker aggregate productivity is the composition of employment growth, which is concentrated in sectors with structurally low productivity growth.
Since the pandemic, employment has grown most in construction and the public sector, both of which have seen a decline in productivity, and in services, which has seen only meagre productivity growth. These trends could also persist in some of these sectors over the next few years given the relative weakness of manufacturing and long-term shifts towards employment in services.
All this means that we will face several years of rising nominal wages, with unit labour cost pressures exacerbated by subdued productivity growth. And in this setting, monetary policy must achieve two key goals.
First, we must ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored as the wage catch-up process plays out. While we do not currently see a wage-price spiral or a de-anchoring of expectations, the longer inflation remains above target, the greater such risks become. That means we need to bring inflation back to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner.
Second, for this to happen, we need to ensure that firms absorb rising labour costs in margins. If monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive, the economy can achieve disinflation overall while real wages recover some of their losses. But this hinges on our policy dampening demand for some time so that firms cannot continue to display the pricing behaviour we have recently seen.
Sensitivity analysis by ECB staff underlines the risks we would face if firms tried to defend their margins instead. For instance, if firms were to regain 25% of the lost profit margin that our projections foresee, inflation in 2025 would be substantially higher than the baseline – at almost 3%.
So, faced with a more persistent inflation process, we need a more persistent policy – one that not only produces sufficient tightening today, but also maintains restrictive conditions until we can be confident that this second phase of the inflation process has been resolved.
The policy stance
What does this imply for our policy in concrete terms?
We have not yet seen the full impact of the cumulative rate hikes we have decided on since last July – amounting to 400 basis points. But our job is not done. Barring a material change to the outlook, we will continue to increase rates in July.
And as we move further into restrictive territory, we need to pay close attention to two dimensions of our policy. First, our actions on the “level” of rates, and second, our communication on future decisions and how that is influencing the expected “length” of time that rates will remain at that level.
The Governing Council has provided orientation on both dimensions. It has stated clearly that “future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary”.
Two sources of uncertainty affect the desired “level” and “length” of our interest rate policies.
First, since we face uncertainty about the persistence of inflation, the level at which rates peak will be state-contingent. It will depend on how the economy and various forces I have described evolve over time. And it will have to be continuously re-assessed over time.
Under these conditions, it is unlikely that in the near future the central bank will be able to state with full confidence that the peak rates have been reached. This is why our policy needs to be decided meeting by meeting and has to remain data-dependent.
Second, we face uncertainty about the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The strength of transmission connects current decisions with expectations of future policy and therefore affects the policy stance. How strong transmission turns out to be in practice will determine the effect of a given rate hike on inflation, and this will be reflected in the expected policy path.
Uncertainty about transmission arises from the fact that the euro area has not been through a sustained phase of rate hikes since the mid-2000s and has never seen rates rise so quickly. And this raises the question of how quickly and forcefully monetary policy will be transmitted to firms – via interest-sensitive spending – and households, via mortgage payments.
For firms, ECB analysis finds that monetary policy shocks are typically transmitted more quickly and forcefully to manufacturing, reflecting the sector’s higher interest-rate sensitivity, while there is a more muted and delayed impact on services.
The key question today is whether the services sector will eventually “catch down” – which is what we have seen in previous cycles – or whether it will be insulated from the effects of policy tightening for longer than in the past, given the strength of demand and employment in the sector.[9]
For households, there is evidence that it will take longer for policy changes to pass through to interest burdens in this tightening cycle, as a higher share of households have fixed-rate mortgages than in the mid-2000s.
At the same time, once mortgages have been repriced, the restrictive effect may be greater: gross debt-to-income ratios, which emphasise debt servicing capacity, are higher than in previous tightening cycles, while the share of homeowners with a mortgage has increased.[10]
Both sources of uncertainty will only fade away with time. And that is why we have made our future policy decisions conditional on, first, the inflation outlook, second, the dynamics of underlying inflation and third, the strength of policy transmission.
But to ensure that uncertainty does not interfere with our intended policy stance – in terms of both “level” and “length” – two points are clear.
First, we need to bring rates into “sufficiently restrictive” territory to lock in our policy tightening.
Second, we need to communicate clearly that we will stay “at those levels for as long as necessary”. This will ensure that hiking rates does not elicit expectations of a too-rapid policy reversal and will allow the full impact of our past actions to materialise.
And all the while, we need to carefully evaluate the strength of policy transmission in order to avoid an error in calibrating policy in either direction.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Monetary policy currently has only one goal: to return inflation to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. And we are committed to reaching this goal come what may.
As the author Helen Keller wrote, “our worst foes are not belligerent circumstances, but wavering spirits”.[11]
We have made significant progress but – faced with a more persistent inflation process – we cannot waver, and we cannot declare victory yet."

Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a panel on the future of crypto at the 22nd BIS Annual Conference, 23 June 2023
Basel, 23 June 2023
Introduction
Some 15 years ago, software developers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto created the source code of what they thought could be decentralised digital cash.[1]Since then, crypto has relied on constantly creating new narratives to attract new investors, revealing incompatible views of what crypto-assets are or ought to be.
The vision of digital cash – of a decentralised payment infrastructure based on cryptography – went awry when blockchain networks became congested in 2017, resulting in soaring transaction fees.[2]
Subsequently, the narrative of digital gold gained momentum, sparking a “crypto rush” that led to one in five adults in the United States and one in ten in Europe speculating on crypto, with a peak market capitalisation of €2.5 trillion.[3]
However, this illusion of crypto-assets serving as easy money and a robust store of value dissipated with the onset of the crypto winter in November 2021. The fall in the price of cryptos (Chart 1) led to a decrease of around €2 trillion worth of crypto assets within less than a year. This caught millions of investors unprepared.[4]An estimated three-quarters of bitcoin users suffered losses on their initial investments at this time.[5]
Understandably, many are now questioning the future of crypto-assets.
But the bursting of the bubble does not necessarily spell the end of crypto-assets.[6]People like to gamble and investing in crypto offers them a way to do so.[7]
Crypto valuations are highly volatile, reflecting the absence of any intrinsic value. This makes them particularly sensitive to changes in risk appetite and market narratives. The recent developments that have affected leading crypto-asset exchanges have highlighted the contradictions of a system which, though created to counteract the centralisation of the financial system, has become highly centralised itself.
Today I will contend that due to their limitations, cryptos have not developed into a form of finance that is innovative and robust, but have instead morphed into one that is deleterious. The crypto ecosystem is riddled with market failures and negative externalities, and it is bound to experience further market disruptions unless proper regulatory safeguards are put in place.
Policymakers should be wary of supporting an industry that has so far produced no societal benefits and is increasingly trying to integrate into the traditional financial system, both to acquire legitimacy as part of that system and to piggyback on it. Instead, regulators should subject cryptos to rigorous regulatory standards, address their social cost, and treat unsound crypto models for what they truly are: a form of gambling.
This may prompt the ecosystem to make more effort to provide genuine value in the field of digital finance.
Shifting narratives: from decentralised payments to centralised gambling
The core promise of cryptos is to replace trust with technology, contending that the concept “code is law” will allow a self-policing system to emerge, free of human judgement and error. This would in turn make it possible for money and finance to operate without trusted intermediaries.
However, this narrative often obfuscates reality. Unbacked cryptos have made no inroads into the conventional role of money. And they have progressively moved away from their original goal of decentralisation to increasingly rely on centralised solutions and market structures. They have become speculative assets[8], as well as a means of circumventing capital controls, sanctions or financial regulation.
A key reason why cryptos have failed to make good on their claim to perform the role of money is technical. Indeed, the use of blockchain – particularly in the form of public, permissionless blockchain – for transacting crypto-assets has exhibited significant limitations.[9]
Transacting cryptos on blockchains can be inefficient, slow and expensive; they face the blockchain trilemma, whereby aiming for optimal levels of security, scalability and decentralisation at the same time is not achievable.[10]
Crypto-assets relying on a proof-of-work validation mechanism, which is especially relevant for bitcoin as the largest crypto-asset by market capitalisation[11], are ecologically detrimental. Public authorities will therefore need to evaluate whether the outsized carbon footprint of certain crypto-assets undermines their green transition commitments.[12]Moreover, proof-of-work validation mechanisms are inadequate for large-scale use.[13]Bitcoin, for example, can only accommodate up to seven transactions per second and fees can be exorbitant.
While alternative solutions to overcome the blockchain trilemma and proof-of-work consensus shortcomings have emerged for faster and more affordable transactions, including those outside the blockchain, they have drawbacks of their own. ""Off-chain"" transactions conducted via third-party platforms compromise the core principles of crypto-assets, including security, validity and immutability.[14]Another important aspect is the operational risk inherent in public blockchains due to the absence of an accountable central governance body that manages operations, incidents or code errors.[15]
Moreover, the handling of crypto-assets can be challenging. In a decentralised blockchain, users must protect their personal keys using self-custody wallets, which can discourage widespread adoption due to the tasks and risks involved, for example the theft or loss of a key. Given the immutability of blockchains, they do not permit transaction reversal.[16]
Another key limitation of unbacked cryptos is their instability.
Unbacked cryptos lack intrinsic value and have no backing reserves or price stabilisation mechanisms.[17]This makes them inherently highly volatile and unsuitable as a means of payment. Bitcoin, for instance, exhibits volatility levels up to four times higher than stocks, or gold (Chart 2).
Such high volatility also means that households cannot rely on crypto-assets as a store of value to smooth their consumption over time. Similarly, firms cannot rely on crypto-assets as a unit of account for the calculation of prices or for their balance sheet.
Moreover, unbacked cryptos do not improve our capacity to hedge against inflation. Indeed, their price developments exhibit an increasing correlation with stock markets (Chart 3). And empirical analysis finds that momentum in the crypto-asset market and global financial market volatility do have an impact on bitcoin trading against fiat currencies.[18]
But the very instability of unbacked cryptos does make them appealing as a means of gambling. Andtheir use as such has been facilitated by the establishment of a centralised market structure that supports the broader use of crypto-assets.[19]
Crypto exchanges have become gateways into the crypto ecosystem, often providing user access to crypto markets in conjunction with other services like wallets, custody, staking[20]or lending. Off-chain grids or third-party platforms have offered users easy and cost-effective ways to engage in trading and speculation, while stablecoins are being used to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto by promising a stable value relative to fiat currency.[21]
Besides gambling, crypto assets are also being used for bypassing capital controls, sanctions and traditional financial regulation. A prime example is bitcoin, which is used to circumvent taxes and regulations, in particular to evade restrictions on international capital flows and foreign exchange transactions, including on remittances.[22]These practices may have destabilising macroeconomic implications in some jurisdictions, notably in developing and emerging markets.
Risks from the growing centralisation of the crypto ecosystem
The crypto ecosystem’s move away from its original goals towards more centralised forms of organisation, typically without regulatory oversight, is giving rise to substantial costs and an array of contradictions. There are two major facets to this phenomenon.
First, dependence on third-party intermediaries, many of which are still unregulated, has resulted in market failures and negative externalities, which crypto was initially designed to sidestep.
The crypto ecosystem, for instance, has cultivated its own concentration risks, with stablecoins assuming a key role in trading and liquidity provision within decentralised finance markets.[23]The difficulties faced by prominent stablecoins in the past year likely contributed significantly to the noticeable downturn in these markets.[24]
Indeed, stablecoins often pose greater risks than initially thought. They introduce into the crypto space the kind of maturity mismatches commonly seen in money market mutual funds. As we have seen in the past year, redemption at par at all times is not guaranteed, risks of runs and contagion are omnipresent, and liquidation of reserve assets can lead to procyclical effects through collateral chains across the crypto ecosystem.
Another episode of instability driven by high concentration risk was the fall of the crypto exchange FTX. Initially the crisis seemed to primarily affect liquidity, but it quickly evolved into a solvency crisis. This situation arose due to FTX’s inadequate risk management, unclear business boundaries and mishandling of customer funds. The repercussions of this event rippled through the crypto ecosystem, causing cascading liquidations[25]that underscored the interconnectedness and opacity of crypto markets. Ultimately, it showcased how swiftly confidence in the industry could deteriorate.
Similarities to the FTX case can be seen in the recent civil charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the biggest remaining crypto exchange: Binance. These civil charges allege that Binance’s CEO and Binance entities were involved in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.[26]Should these allegations be proven, this would be yet another example of the fundamental shortcomings of the crypto ecosystem.
The recent crypto failures also show that risk, in itself, is technology-neutral. In financial services, it does not matter if a business ledger is kept on paper as it was for hundreds of years, in a centralised system as we have now or on a blockchain as in the crypto asset ecosystem. In the end, whether a firm remains in business or fails depends on how it manages credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and leverage. Crypto enthusiasts would do well to remember that new technology does not make financial risk disappear. The financial risk either remains or transforms into a different type. It is like pressing a balloon on one side: it will change in shape until it pops on the other side. And if the balloon is full of hot air, it may rise for a while but will burst in the end.
Links with the traditional financial sector
The second contradiction arises from the crypto industry’s attempt to strengthen ties with actors in the financial system, including banks, big tech companies and the public sector.
Major payment networks[27]and intermediaries[28]have enhanced their support services for crypto-assets. Numerous prominent tech companies, including Meta (formerly Facebook) and Twitter, have explored ways to incorporate crypto into their platforms.[29]By leveraging their large customer base and offering a mix of payments and other financial services, tech firms, especially big techs, could solidify the ties between crypto-assets and the financial system.
The recent failures of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank have highlighted the risks for banks associated with raising deposits from the crypto sector. The stability of these deposits is questionable given cryptos’ volatility. The discontinuation of the Silvergate Exchange Network and SigNet, which functioned as a quasi-payment system for the crypto investments of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank clients, also shows how crypto-assets service providers depend on the traditional financial sector for settlement in fiat money.
The crypto industry not only seeks to strengthen its ties with the traditional financial industry. It also seeks to gain access to the public safety net that strongly regulated financial entities benefit from.[30]Indeed, Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) tried to gain access to the Federal Reserve's overnight reverse repurchasing facility in order to back its stablecoin.[31]
The crypto industry is seeking to grow by parasitising the financial system: it touts itself as an alternative to the financial sector, yet it seeks shelter within that very sector to address its inherent risks, all in the absence of adequate regulatory safeguards.
The public response: backing, regulating or innovating?
The public sector response can be encapsulated in three main suggestions.
First, the temptation to offer public backing to cryptos must be resisted.
The idea of permitting stablecoin issuers as non-bank financial institutions to hold their reserves at central banks might seem appealing, but could lead to serious adverse consequences.
By granting stablecoins access to the central bank’s balance sheet, we would effectively outsource the provision of central bank money. If the stablecoin issuer were able to invest its reserve assets[32]in the form of risk-free deposits at the central bank, this would eliminate the investment risks that ultimately fall on the shoulders of stablecoin holders. And the stablecoin issuer could offer the stablecoin holders a means of payment that would be a close substitute for central bank money.[33]
This would compromise monetary sovereignty, financial stability and the smooth operation of the payment system. For example, a stablecoin could displace sovereign money by using the large customer network of a big tech, with far-reaching implications.[34]Therefore, central banks should exercise prudence and retain control over their balance sheet and the money supply.
Regulating cryptos adequately and comprehensively
Second, regulators should refrain from implying that regulation can transform crypto-assets into safe assets. Efforts to legitimise unsound crypto models in a bid to attract crypto activities should be avoided.[35]
Moreover, the principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"" should be endorsed. Cryptos cannot become as safe as other assets and investors should be aware of the risks. Anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism rules should be enforced, and crypto activities of traditional firms should be carefully monitored.
While some jurisdictions attempt to apply existing regulatory frameworks to crypto-assets, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation offers a customised regulatory structure that applies to all 27 EU Member States and draws on existing regulation where appropriate (e-money being one example). The EU has also updated existing regulation, for instance by extending the travel rule to crypto transactions.[36]
Despite the EU taking the lead in establishing a comprehensive framework regulating crypto activities, further steps are necessary. All activities related to the crypto industry should be regulated, including decentralised finance activities like crypto-asset lending or non-custodial wallet services[37]. Moreover, the regulatory framework for unbacked crypto-assets may be deemed lighter than for stablecoins as it relies mainly on disclosure requirements for issuing white papers[38], and on the supervision of the service providers which will offer them for trading. The risks posed by unbacked crypto-assets, which are largely used for speculative purposes, should be fully recognised. Enhancing transparency and awareness of the risks associated with crypto-assets and their social cost are critical aspects of this approach. Public authorities will also need to address those social costs: for instance, cryptos’ ecological footprint cannot be ignored in view of environmental challenges.
Additionally, the experience of FTX, which expanded massively with little oversight, underscores the importance of global crypto regulation and regulatory cooperation. The Financial Stability Board’s recommendations[39]for the regulation and oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets need to be finalised and implemented urgently, also in non-FSB jurisdictions. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's standard on the prudential treatment of banks' crypto-asset exposures is a positive step in this direction. It stipulates conservative capital requirements for unbacked crypto-assets with a risk weight of 1,250%, as well as an exposure limit constraining the total amount of unbacked crypto a bank can hold to generally below 1% of Tier 1 capital. It will be key for the European Union and other Basel jurisdictions to transpose the Basel standard into their legislation by the 1 January 2025 deadline[40].
However, regulation alone will not be sufficient.
Innovating: digital settlement assets and central bank digital currencies
Third, the public sector needs to contribute to the development of reliable digital settlement assets.
Central banks are innovating to provide a stability anchor that maintains trust in all forms of money in the digital age. Central bank money for retail use is currently only available in physical form – cash. But the digitisation of payments is diminishing the role of cash and its capacity to provide an effective monetary anchor. A central bank digital currency would offer a digital, risk-free standard and facilitate convertibility among different forms of private digital money. It would uphold the singleness of money and protect monetary sovereignty. We are advancing with our digital euro project and aim to complete our investigation phase later this year.
Furthermore, the tokenisation of digital finance may require central banks to modify their technological infrastructure supporting the issuance of central bank money for wholesale transactions. This could involve establishing a bridge between market distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms and central bank infrastructures, or a new DLT-based wholesale settlement service with DLT-based central bank money.[41]We will involve the market in the exploratory work that we have recently announced.[42]
Conclusion
To conclude, crypto-assets have been promoted as decentralised alternatives promising more resilient financial services. However, the reality does not live up to that promise. The blockchain technology underpinning crypto-assets can be extremely slow, energy-intensive and insufficiently scalable. The practicality of crypto-assets for everyday transactions is low due to their complex handling and significant price volatility.
To address these drawbacks, the crypto ecosystem has changed its narrative, favouring more centralised forms of organisation that emphasise crypto speculation and quick profit. But recent events have exposed the fragility of the crypto ecosystem, demonstrating how quickly confidence in crypto-assets can evaporate. In many respects, this ecosystem has recreated the very shortcomings and vulnerabilities that blockchain technology initially intended to address.
Further complicating matters, the crypto market seeks integration into the financial sector for increased relevance and public sector support. This would not provide the basis of a sustainable future for crypto. If anything, it would only heighten contradictions and vulnerabilities, resulting in greater instability and centralisation.
The public sector should adopt a determined position by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework that addresses the social and environmental risks associated with crypto, including the use of unbacked crypto-assets for speculative purposes. It should also resist calls to provide state backing for cryptos, which would essentially socialise crypto risks. The public sector should instead focus its efforts on contributing to the development of reliable digital settlement assets, including through their work on central bank digital currencies.
Decisive action of this kind should motivate the crypto ecosystem, including its foundational technology, the blockchain, to realign its objectives towards delivering real economic value within the digital finance landscape."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB,at
        the Summit for a new global financing pact in Paris
Paris, 23 June 2023
I am truly honoured to be with you here today at this important summit to address the most pressing issue of our
        time.
Eight years ago in Paris, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the COP21 by stating that “Paris must mark a
        turning point […]” towards limiting global warming to 1.5 °Celsius.[1]
Today, the window of opportunity to achieve this goal is closing before our eyes: The past eight years have been
        the warmest on record worldwide[2]and the critical 1.5 C
        threshold for annual temperatures will likely be exceeded in at least one year before 2027.[3]
Record-breaking droughts, heatwaves and floods are already plaguing the world. They are inflicting suffering and
        damage on every continent and serve as a mere glimpse into the future. It is everyone’s duty to take every
        possible step to ensure that the Paris climate goal is reached.
Not only is this a matter of justice for future generations, it is also undoubtedly a matter of justice and
        responsibility for today’s. Developing nations are already the hardest hit by the impact of global warming. One
        fact is glaringly evident: developing countries are poised to bear a disproportionate share of the impact. More
        than 90% of those who have perished owing to extreme weather events during the last half-century lived in these
        countries, where more than 70% of reported disasters occurred.[4]
The path forward is clear: we must forge ahead with a global transition to ensure our economies are future-proof.
        This means not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero and adapting our economies to shield them from
        climate change, but also tackling the root causes of the severe destruction of nature that is threatening the
        vital resources we rely on for our survival. ECB research shows that in Europe alone, over 70% of our economy is
        highly dependent on nature’s ecosystem services[5]– a figure that
        is likely to be much higher in developing economies.
In taking up this challenge, there are at least three levers we can use to boost the funding needed for a green
        and just transition on a global scale.
First and foremost, it is up to governments to lead the fight against climate change and honour their commitments
        to financing the transition.
Developed economies must lead by example and honour the USD 100 billion climate pledge made 14 years ago at COP15
        in Copenhagen. Governments should also mobilise private finance by implementing transition policies and creating
        a sound and stable framework to attract capital flows at the national and global level.
Second, governments can push for reform of the multilateral financial architecture.
The G20 – this year under India’s presidency – can play a key role in unlocking additional funding. The review of
        the capital adequacy frameworks of multilateral development banks can offer such opportunity. More generally, we
        must identify and remove public and private barriers to green finance worldwide wherever possible.
Third, central banks around the world can and must, within their mandates, support the greening of the financial
        system.
The Network for Greening the Financial System, which brings
        together 127 central banks and supervisors from all around the world, has played a crucial role in accelerating
        global action and will continue to do so.
We at the ECB have also made it a priority to take account of climate change, because (i) it affects inflation;
        (ii) it affects our balance sheet; and (iii) it is a financial risk for the banks we supervise. We have adjusted
        our corporate bond holdings and changed our collateral and risk management to better reflect climate risks and
        at the same time provide incentives to support the green transition of the economy. As supervisors, we make sure
        that banks consider climate risks when making business and lending decisions. We also stress test the impact of
        climate change on the economy and financial stability. Through our advice, analysis and actions, we aim to
        manage the financial risks stemming from climate change as well as provide evidence to support the need for the
        transition I just mentioned.
These transformations have occurred within a remarkably short period of just a few years, reflecting the growing
        momentum of our global collective efforts to combat climate change. Today’s conference is evidence of our shared
        dedication to ramp up our actions as the window to meet our climate targets narrows.
We can preserve the 1.5 °C threshold through our united efforts. As Sir David Attenborough so eloquently put it,
        “If working apart we are a force powerful enough to destabilise our planet, surely working together we are
        powerful enough to save it”.[6]Through our actions, let’s prove
        him right."

Keynote speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Fifth Joint Deutsche Bundesbank, European Central Bank and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Conference on CCP Risk Management
Frankfurt am Main, 22 June 2023
The agreement by the G20 in 2009 to make central clearing mandatory was a significant milestone on the path to enhancing counterparty credit risk management.[1]
In the years that followed, a series of regulatory and supervisory measures were introduced to ensure that the concentration of risks in central counterparties (CCPs) would be addressed through adequate risk management practices.
In the current context of elevated economic and financial uncertainty, CCPs must adapt their risk management strategies. Public authorities, meanwhile, must consider how they can best adjust the regulatory and oversight framework for CCPs.
In my remarks today, I will highlight three areas that require progress to preserve the pivotal role of CCPs in safeguarding stability. I will discuss challenges in cross-border supervision, the need to be better prepared for extreme stress events and further actions to limit margin procyclicality.
Challenges in cross-border supervision
Let me start with challenges in cross-border supervision.
Arrangements for cross-border supervision need to be commensurate with the cross-border systemic risk implications of central clearing. This is particularly true in extreme scenarios in which a CCP has exhausted its prefunded financial buffers. In these circumstances, allocating losses on an ad hoc basis could exacerbate credit and liquidity strains for clearing participants, which are often located across several jurisdictions.
The ECB therefore supports the European Commission’s proposal to enhance EU-level CCP supervision.[2]Given the increasing importance and complexity of EU CCPs, as well as their interconnectedness with significant credit institutions that are clearing members, enhancing the supervision of central clearing at EU level is necessary.[3]
Some have questioned this proposal, arguing that, in the event of a CCP being resolved, any losses would be borne by the taxpayers of the country where the CCP is domiciled.
But this argument overlooks the fact that both global standards and EU law require CCPs to establish comprehensive arrangements so that any losses related to the default of a clearing member are allocated to the surviving participants. Moreover, even if we were to reach the final stage of resolution and temporary public funding was provided, this would be recouped from clearing participants in line with the CCP’s arrangements for allocating losses.
The risks of EU CCPs therefore mainly affect clearing participants, which are generally located throughout the EU. This needs to be reflected in the supervision of EU CCPs through a greater role for the relevant authorities, including banking supervisors and central banks of issue, as potential providers of liquidity to clearing participants or CCPs.[4]
Our ability to address concerns arising from excessive exposures to third-country CCPs is also critical. More than one-third of the total collateral posted by EU clearing members for centrally cleared derivative transactions is posted to third-country CCPs. Particular concerns arise in relation to euro-denominated interest rate swaps and short-term interest rate futures and options, which are relevant for the smooth implementation of monetary policy but are mostly cleared outside the EU. For instance, around 80% of the total notional outstanding on euro-denominated interest rate swaps is cleared outside the EU[5]. And around 50% of EU clients active in euro-denominated interest swaps do not clear these trades in the EU.
EU authorities have less direct insight into – and ability to control – the risk management of CCPs located outside the EU. Current EU rules seek to reduce these gaps through the European Securities and Markets Authority’s targeted direct supervision of systemically relevant third-country CCPs – known as Tier 2 CCPs. But this framework would be powerless in severe circumstances where the resolution of a Tier 2 CCP may be required.
To deal with this vulnerability, I see two priorities.
First, we need to accelerate efforts to develop resolution plans for all major cross-border CCPs, in close cooperation with the relevant host authorities. Internationalagreement to proceed in this direction was reached, in principle, back in 2014.[6]However, almost 10 years on, resolution plans have not been put in place for any of the major global CCPs. We should not wait for a severe crisis in central clearing before closing this gap.
Second, while resolution plans play a significant role in reducing the potential fallout from CCP resolution, they cannot offer absolute guarantees, especially when the cross-border implications are considered.[7]
Against this background, the ECB supports the European Commission’s proposal that will require EU clearing participants to hold a so-called active account at EU CCPs in the few market segments that are considered to be of substantial systemic importance to the EU.[8]
The objective of the active account is to build and sustain an appropriate level of domestic clearing capacity for essential euro-denominated clearing services. This would also facilitate rebalancing between domestic and offshore business if, for example, it was deemed more prudent in view of evolving risks in a host CCP. An adequate domestic clearing capacity helps to preserve financial stability within the EU and to ensure the smooth functioning of euro area markets.
Given the economic benefits of global liquidity pools, implementing the active account will require a carefully calibrated and phased approach. We understand the concerns raised. However, around 50% of the EU clients that are not active in EU CCPs are only active in euro-denominated trades, so cross-currency pooling is not always the main issue.
Furthermore, although establishing an active account will not be without cost, it must also be acknowledged that EU stakeholders have a joint responsibility to establish a central clearing framework that is robust in periods of severe stress. Disrupted access to critical clearing services during a financial crisis would have much greater financial risk implications than gradually moving part of the respective euro-denominated business to EU CCPs.
Better preparedness for extreme stress events
The second area in which further progress is required is our capacity to effectively address low-probability, high-impact types of risk. Let me give two examples here.
First, the current guidance on non-default loss risk[9]is much less developed than the guidance on risks related to participant default. This is despite the fact that the impact of non-default losses could be particularly significant, especially given that the resources available to cover such losses – mainly CCPs’ own capital – are limited. This became clear from the results of the FSB, CPMI and IOSCO analysis of CCP financial resources for recovery and resolution.[10]
While CCPs are taking significant measures to mitigate non-default loss risk, this risk cannot be eliminated. Therefore, arrangements for assessing and preparing for potential non-default losses are essential, and we support the CPMI-IOSCO initiative to further explore CCPs’ risk mitigants for non-default losses.[11]
Second, there has been insufficient progress in terms of preparedness for events that, based on historical experience, would go beyond what could be considered extreme but still plausible. Progress needs to be made, particularly in conceptualising such scenarios and embedding them in CCP recovery and resolution plans. While it is important to learn from past vulnerabilities – as has typically been the focus to date – we also need to do more to identify extreme hypothetical scenarios and consider the full range of potential risks, such as financial, conjunctural, geopolitical, cyber and environmental risks.
Reducing the procyclicality of margins
Central clearing in turbulent times also raises critical issues in terms of margin procyclicality.
A certain degree of margin procyclicality is unavoidable, given that margin requirements reflect evolving risks. At the same time, a certain degree of margin stability over the medium term is necessary to reduce the need for sudden, large margin calls in times of stress. The role of CCPs as shock absorbers is crucial in such situations, as they help to avoid negative feedback loops between tightened risk management at CCPs and the financial strains of clearing participants.
Mitigation of margin procyclicality is reflected in both the global standards and the EU rules for CCPs. However, recent periods of extreme market volatility have underlined the need to do more.[12]
The review conducted in 2020 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, CPMI and IOSCO on margin practices provides us with a clear roadmap for action.[13]This includes enhancing CCPs’ tools to anticipate stress and reflecting margin procyclicality in the development of countercyclical measures and the validation of margin models. Margin transparency should also be enhanced, in terms of both the transparency of CCPs vis-à-vis clearing members and the transparency of clearing members vis-à-vis clients.
The ECB is actively contributing to the follow-up work that is under way. Once the results of this work are available, significant efforts will be needed to embed them in the rules of all relevant jurisdictions.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The introduction of mandatory central clearing has served us well in terms of enhancing counterparty risk management and market transparency.
However, in today’s turbulent market environment, all stakeholders – CCPs, clearing participants and authorities alike – must adopt a more forward-looking mindset.
Short-term cost considerations – be it stimulating clearing activity in the EU, enhancing stress-testing and cooperative arrangements or stepping up margin requirements and disclosure – must be balanced against the longer-term benefits of a robust set-up in which CCPs remain a pillar of our financial system.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ceremony to award the 21st Germán Bernácer Prize for Promoting Economic Research in Europe to Matteo Maggiori
Madrid, 20 June 2023
We are meeting today to award the Germán Bernácer Prize for outstanding contributions in the fields of macroeconomics and finance to a young European economist, Matteo Maggiori.[1]This 21st edition of the prize[2]honours Matteo “for his influential research on international finance and macroeconomics, including asset pricing and exchange rate dynamics”. I am delighted to be here today to celebrate his achievements with you.
Matteo’s research sheds light on many important aspects of international macroeconomics and finance under a common overarching theme: the role of imperfect financial markets.[3]A non-exhaustive list of his research includes: the international financial system; reserve currencies; tax havens; global capital flows and portfolio investment; exchange rate dynamics; expectations and bubbles. His research effectively combines theory with data, and it often provides key insights for economic – and monetary – policy.
In the decade since he graduated from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, Matteo has already made a profound mark on the profession and earned wide recognition, reflected in numerous prizes and awards.[4]His work is widely cited and published in the top academic journals. Since 2019 Matteo has been teaching as a Professor of Finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
Today I would like to highlight some of Matteo’s key contributions. But let me start with one caveat: Matteo is very productive. Far too productive for me to do justice to all his work in my brief remarks today. So I will inevitably have to skip over much of his work, such as his recent award-winning paper on heterogeneous investor beliefs[5]andhis new research on the link between exchange rates and stock market returns.[6]
Not everyone in the room may know that – not so long ago – Matteo was a trader of foreign exchange and interest rates (at JP Morgan). This experience enabled him to see first-hand how financial markets work. And it has been a source of inspiration for Matteo’s choice of research topics, which are always of practical relevance. Matteo’s background seems to underpin his approach to research, which often treats traditional theoretical assumptions in international macroeconomics with a healthy dose of scepticism.
In one of his first papers,[7]for example, he observes that exchange rates rarely absorb shocks in the way economic theory typically assumes. This paper, co-authored with Xavier Gabaix, nicely illustrates Matteo’s focus on international macroeconomics with imperfect financial markets. It stresses the financial determinants of exchange rates, namely financiers’ limited risk-bearing capacity and its role in explaining a number of puzzles and phenomena in international finance.
Another notable area of Matteo’s work is his research on the functioning of the international financial system and the role of reserve currencies, in particular the US dollar.[8]Together with Emmanuel Farhi,[9]he shows how many well-known theories and conjectures – such as those of Keynes,[10]Nurkse[11]and Triffin[12]– can be combined in a single, easy-to-use framework. Their work shows that a shift from a single reserve currency issuer to a large number of them would have a positive impact on welfare, but also that the effect of an intermediate shift – a shift to a small number of issuers – depends on multiple factors and might in some cases be destabilising.
Matteo is also exceptionally creative in using microdata to pin down the workings of the international monetary and financial system. In a paper on capital allocation[13]he exposes a home currency bias in global bond holdings: lenders prefer bonds denominated in their home currency, but care little about where the borrower resides. On the borrowing side, all but the very large firms issue bonds only in their home currency. Because of the investors’ home currency bias, firms borrow very little from abroad. The big exception to this pattern is the United States. Almost all investors appear willing to lend in US dollars, meaning that even small US firms borrow not only from domestic but also from foreign sources. Small firms thus benefit particularly if their home currency is an international currency, because it gives them easy access to the global capital market. This paper is therefore also relevant for the policy debate about the international role of the euro. This diligent data work shows that the international role of currencies is very much in flux – a finding that obviously makes one wonder what is driving this. Matteo and his co-authors describe how countries compete in establishing a reserve currency and how important it is to gradually build reputation.[14]
US financial markets get attention in any study of global capital flows. There is a good reason for this – the special role they play. But there is another reason, which is not a particularly good one, namely data availability. Over the years, the network of cross-country financial links has become increasingly complex. International funding is often channelled through intermediaries in tax haven countries, which blurs the link between borrowing and lending economies in the official statistics and with it the measurement of the international transmission of shocks. The Global Capital Allocation Project[15]which Matteo co-founded explores these links at a global scale: by following corporate ownership chains to derive consolidated portfolio holdings, it uncovered that the bilateral portfolio investment of developed economies in large emerging economies is much larger than commonly thought. For example, the euro area’s exposure to Chinese equity and debt, for example, turns out to be respectively three and five times larger than previously estimated. It also suggests that some of what has been considered foreign direct investment is portfolio investment in disguise, which is known to be more volatile. Moreover, Matteo and his co-authors show that the foreign currency exposure of emerging economies’ external liabilities is considerably larger, which has important implications for risk assessment and thus for economic and monetary policy. Despite the great data challenges, Matteo and his co-authors – in a cooperation between the Global Capital Allocation Project and the ECB – also took on the task of disentangling the investment positions of offshore-like financial centres within the euro area. They show, for example, that the euro area is less financially integrated than official data suggest.[16]This project is not only promising because it may change our priors on financial exposures within and outside the euro area, but also because it demonstrates how central banks and academics can join forces to shed light on complex financial intermediations chains within Europe and globally.
Before I give you the impression that Matteo is a pure international macroeconomist, let me highlight another – quite different – area of his work: the economics of very long-run discounting. Investment decisions in the fight against climate change hinge crucially on discounting cash flows far out in the future. Due to compounding, small differences in the discount rate can determine whether a project will be implemented or not. But we have very little guidance on what the proper discount rate might be. To help us select the appropriate one, Matteo and his co-authors examine information on very long-term leases – of 100 or more years’ maturity – in the United Kingdom and Singapore and compare the price of such leases with the price ofbuyingsimilar properties, i.e. with the price of owning without a time limit. They show that people care quite a lot about cash flows in the distant future: the implied very long-run discount rate is only 2.6% per year.[17]Discount rates for such long horizons are highly relevant for weighing up the costs and benefits of projects spanning more than one generation, such as those related to climate and the environment.[18]
Given the evidence of climate change, I do not have to stress the importance of this research. Matteo and his co-authors make the important point that investments mitigating global warming and its effects should be priced like an insurance.[19]An insurance is most valuable in the bad states of the world, and thus the appropriate discount rate must bebelowthe risk-free rate at all horizons.But if the appropriate discount rate for a climate change hedge is less than 2.6% for long-term projects, and even less for short-term ones,[20]then far more public and private projects should be implemented than suggested by other studies.
The long-run discount rate issue has direct implications for the overall strategy to fight global warming, which goes far beyond economics. So, my opening remarks about Matteo’s work providing “key insights for economic and monetary policy” do not fully do it justice. Matteo’s latest working paper,[21]released just a few days ago, studies the interface between geopolitics and economics. It describes how dominance in key industries, such as finance or information technology, enables a hegemon country to extract rents from small open economies. The framework adds a strategic aspect to the economic underpinnings of geopolitical power.
Let me conclude. In this brief tour through Matteo’s research, I hope I have conveyed just how much he has expanded our knowledge in an impressive range of areas. His topical and seminal work is international macroeconomics at its best: innovative, data-driven, and providing lessons for policymakers. Matteo, we all look forward to your research and new insights in the coming years!
I am delighted to congratulate you, Matteo, on winning the 2022 Germán Bernácer Prize for Promoting Economic Research in Europe."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Euro50 Group conference on “New challenges for the Economic and Monetary Union in the post-crisis environment”
Luxembourg, 19 June 2023
The ECB has taken forceful action in response to the unprecedented surge in euro area inflation. We have embarked on the fastest tightening cycle in our history, raising our key policy rate – the deposit facility rate – from -0.5% to 3.5%, and started reducing the size of our balance sheet.
Our actions are being swiftly transmitted to borrowing conditions, slowing the pace of credit creation. Inflation has started to come down from its historically high level, largely reflecting the sharp drop in energy prices. Underlying inflation has also moderated recently, but it has proven more persistent than expected.
Despite the welcome turn in inflationary developments, the path towards sustained price stability remains uncertain and fraught with risks.
In my remarks today, I will reflect on the outlook for inflation in the euro area. I will first explain the factors that are expected to drive the continued decline in headline inflation under the latest Eurosystem staff projections. I will then describe some risks around the baseline scenario and discuss what these imply for the optimal conduct of monetary policy.
Profit margins expected to absorb rising labour costs
In the June 2023 Eurosystem staff projections, headline inflation is expected to decline notably over the coming months and to gradually converge to levels somewhat above 2% in 2025 (Slide 2, left-hand side).[1]
The projected decline in headline inflation rests, to a significant extent, on a further decline in energy inflation and a marked drop in food inflation, both driven by large base effects (Slide 2, right-hand side). Core inflation is projected to moderate more gradually, from an average of 5.1% this year to 2.3% in 2025, as pipeline pressures recede and the tightening of monetary policy increasingly weighs on economic activity.[2]
Over the near term, disinflation is hence primarily driven by a reversal of the supply-side shocks that had caused the unprecedented surge in inflation (Slide 3, left-hand side). Surveys show that bottlenecks in the global manufacturing sector have by now fully unwound and that input prices have fallen to the lowest level in many years as gas and oil prices have continued their sharp descent.
Softening demand, as reflected in a decline in new orders, should further support the disinflationary impulse in the manufacturing sector, which is particularly sensitive to higher interest rates.
As the energy shock unwinds and supply chains normalise, domestic demand, and wage growth in particular, has become the dominant factor driving recent inflation developments, and is expected to remain so over the projection horizon (Slide 3, right-hand side).
Demand-side shocks tend to be more persistent, especially in the euro area’s institutional environment built on centralised collective bargaining, with wage agreements having an average duration of around two years.[3]
Price pressures in the services sector, where labour costs represent a larger share of total costs, are therefore expected to fade more gradually. The catch-up in wages is assumed to moderate on the back of falling headline inflation, while current high nominal wage growth is expected to be absorbed, to a large extent, by firms’ profit margins, thus breaking the vicious circle between wages and prices.[4]
Firms’ selling price expectations, which have been correlating closely with consumer price inflation over the past two years, corroborate the assumptions underlying the projections (Slide 4, left-hand side).
In the manufacturing sector, the share of firms expecting to raise prices further has fallen back to pre-pandemic levels. In the services sector, the share remains higher but has also been coming down for four consecutive months.
Risks to the inflation outlook tilted to the upside
The baseline scenario of the Eurosystem staff projections is a plausible representation of how inflation could evolve in the absence of further shocks. That said, the outlook for inflation remains highly uncertain.
On the downside, banks may tighten credit standards by more than currently envisaged because of risks to the value of their assets, their exposure to interest rate risk and tighter funding conditions.[5]A re-emergence of financial tensions constitutes another downside risk. Together, such effects could accelerate disinflation in the euro area.
On the upside, risks are broader. Option prices in financial markets suggest that risks to the medium-term inflation outlook remain tilted to the upside (Slide 4, right-hand side).
Three types of upside risks can be distinguished.
One is that negative supply-side shocks could continue to hit the euro area and global economy. These risks are particularly pertinent for fossil fuels, like gas and oil, due to the green transition and the war in Ukraine.[6]
There are also other shocks, however, that we know exist but that are difficult to integrate into the baseline, so-called “known unknowns”.
El Niño is a case in point. The US Climate Prediction Center has recently declared that El Niño conditions are now officially present and are expected to gradually strengthen in the northern hemisphere in the winter of 2023/24.[7]
ECB analysis suggests that a one-degree temperature increase during El Niño historically raised global food prices by more than 6% after one year (Slide 5, left-hand side).
El Niño also reinforces the risks of extreme weather events stemming from global warming. Sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic are currently significantly above their average over the past 40 years (Slide 5, right-hand side).
The war in Ukraine, in particular the heightened uncertainty about the Black Sea grain deal and the flooding caused by the destruction of the dam in the Kherson region, poses further upside risks to food inflation.
New research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis suggests that food price inflation matters. Among consumer price index components, it was found to be the one with the highest signal-to-noise ratio and hence predictive power for future headline inflation, more than any core inflation component.[8]
The second type of upside risk relates to hysteresis effects.
Shocks, even if transitory, can have persistent effects on economic activity.[9]The global financial crisis of 2008, for example, inflicted sustained income losses on millions of workers who remained excluded from labour markets for many years.[10]
Similarly, the pandemic and the energy price shock after the Russian invasion of Ukraine may cause long-lasting damage to the euro area’s supply capacity.
We are seeing two concerning developments. One is thataveragehours worked per employee remain below pre-pandemic levels (Slide 6, left-hand side).[11]As a result, despite the strong increase in employment by 3.1%,totalhours worked increased by only 1.4% over the same period.[12]
One reason behind the sluggish recovery in average hours worked is the marked increase in sick leaves.[13]In Germany, for example, around 8.5% of all employees insured in the public health system were recorded as being on sick leave at the peak last winter (Slide 6, right-hand side).[14]Insurance funds data suggest that more than 60% of the increase in sick leaves is related to respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.[15]
The second concern is that a notable gap has emerged between actual investment and the investment levels that could have been expected if the economy had evolved along its pre-pandemic growth path (Slide 7, left-hand side). This shortfall significantly predates the tightening of monetary policy.
Supply chain disruptions affecting critical capital goods, such as semiconductor chips, have been one reason why capital accumulation has slowed. As delivery times normalise, these effects should reverse, supported by investments related to the green transition, digitalisation and reshoring of parts of global supply chains.
Other factors may prove more persistent, however. Most notably, uncertainty in the wake of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine remains significant.
The automotive sector is a case in point.
The number of car registrations remains well below pre-pandemic figures, as price level effects and legislative efforts to accelerate the green transition have made many consumers reluctant to purchase new vehicles (Slide 7, right-hand side).[16]Instead, they hold on to their old cars for longer, with the average age of passenger cars having risen to 12 years, from 7 to 8 years not so long ago.
In other words, even as past shocks abate, their broader repercussions may have persistent effects on the future productive capacity of the economy. Indeed, potential output estimates for the euro area have been measurably revised down relative to the pre-pandemic trend.[17]
New research shows that such hysteresis effects may amplify and prolong the rise in inflation caused by transitory supply shocks.[18]The reason is that the fall in investment and the rise in employment required to restore total hours worked tends to weigh on productivity and thereby raise firms’ marginal costs.[19]
This channel is economically relevant. Labour productivity growth, both per employee and per hour, contracted in the first quarter of this year, putting upward pressure on unit labour costs, which is the relevant cost measure for firms (Slide 8).
In the Eurosystem staff projections, these effects are expected to reverse, as labour productivity growth is forecast to rebound strongly in 2024 and 2025. The implied fall in unit labour costs, in turn, is expected to allow firms to absorb the increase in nominal wages in their profit margins.
Should weak productivity growth persist, however, the further increase in unit labour costs raises the probability that firms will pass on parts of the increase in their costs to final consumer prices, setting in motion a perilous wage-price spiral.
This brings me to the third type of upside risks: aggregate demand may be slowing by less than currently anticipated, implying that fiscal and monetary policy are not sufficiently restrictive.
Fiscal policy is expected to tighten over the projection horizon. However, only about half of the discretionary stimulus provided in response to the pandemic and the energy shock is expected to be reversed by 2025.
Such discretionary measures are leaving fiscal policy accommodative and are not sufficiently offset by efforts to increase public investments that could help reduce medium-term inflationary pressures. In this case, monetary policy must become more restrictive.[20]
Quantifying the level of interest rates necessary to bring inflation back to target in a timely manner is inherently difficult, however, as there is large uncertainty about the effects of monetary policy.
First, within each model there is a large range of plausible outcomes (known as parameter uncertainty). For example, according to a benchmark model from the academic literature, a one percentage point increase in the short-term interest rate could dampen inflation after one year by as little as 0.1 percentage point, or by as much as 0.8 percentage points (Slide 9, left-hand side).[21]
The second source of uncertainty relates to model uncertainty – that is, even the median estimate, which itself is surrounded by large parameter uncertainty, usually differs considerably across different classes of economic models.[22]For example, the estimated impact on inflation in 2025 of the ECB’s policy actions taken since December 2021 ranges from 0.9 to 3.9 percentage points across three of the ECB’s main macroeconomic models (Slide 9, right-hand side).
These differences reflect, to a considerable degree, the role that expectations are assumed to play in consumption and investment decisions. Put simply, the more households and firms believe that the past is a good guide for the future, the less powerful monetary policy will be.
Inflation expectations are a case in point. If they are adaptive, meaning they change in response to actual inflation outcomes, inflation will become more persistent, and monetary policy will transmit more slowly.
Carefully analysing how inflation expectations evolve is therefore critical for understanding the strength and speed of policy transmission. At present, the long period of above-target inflation raises concerns about a potential shift in inflation expectations.
The experience over the past ten years suggests that market-based measures of long-term inflation compensation are not always firmly anchored around our 2% target (Slide 10, left-hand side). Before the pandemic, they declined significantly as inflation fell short of our target. About a year ago, they gradually began to move beyond 2%, to currently stand around 2.5%.[23]
Expectations of inflation settling above our 2% target could be an early sign that investor start questioning central banks’ determination to restore price stability.
In a recent survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for example, nearly two-thirds of respondents said that global central banks would accept inflation of 2% to 3% if it helped to avoid a recession, suggesting risks to central banks’ credibility (Slide 10, right-hand side). Nearly a fifth said central banks would accept even higher inflation of 3% to 4%.
For euro area firms, evidence on inflation expectations remains scant. A regular survey among Italian firms conducted by Banca d’Italia suggests that Italian firms generally expect inflation to decline from current high levels, but to be highly persistent and to remain above 5% in 2025 (Slide 11).[24]
Previous rounds of the same survey suggest that expectations of high inflation are not a systematic feature: in 2019, Italian firms expected inflation to settle below 1% two years ahead.[25]That is, firms’ expectations seem to adapt to periods of both low and high inflation, just as those of investors in financial markets.
Inflation expectations of consumers are more readily available from surveys run by various institutions. One main insight from those surveys is that many consumers are inattentive. For example, in the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, a significant share of respondents expects prices to always remain unchanged, both over the short and medium term (Slide 12).
That said, consumer surveys also signal shifts in expectations. Today, for example, less households expect inflation to be at, or close to, 2% over the medium term than on average over the past three years (Slide 12, right-hand side).
Yet, there can be large discrepancies across surveys. In the ECB’s survey, reported inflation expectations for German households three years ahead are currently 2%, while they are 5% in the survey conducted by the Deutsche Bundesbank (Slide 13, left-hand side). Differences of that size complicate the assessment as to whether expectations are anchored or not.
Qualitative data, as collected by the European Commission, are therefore a useful complement for understanding consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations.[26]
In the past, inflation perceptions tended to closely follow actual inflation trends (Slide 13, right-hand side). Recently, however, an unusual gap has emerged between inflation perceptions and actual inflation.[27]It seems that the recent sharp decline in headline inflation has not yet affected consumers’ perceptions, as they continue to experience inflation as historically high.
The observed shift in inflation expectations can hence reduce the strength of policy transmission.
Structural factors can further dampen the effects of monetary policy, three of which seem quantitatively most relevant.
The first is the rising share of services in economic activity and employment.[28]While the services sector accounted for around half of gross value added during the tightening cycle of the 1970s, it accounts for more than 70% today. Similarly, three jobs out of four are in the services sector.
The shift towards services is likely to affect monetary policy transmission.[29]Because services are less capital-intensive and their prices are, on average, more rigid than in other sectors, changes in interest rates are slower to affect aggregate inflation outcomes.[30]
The second factor relates to the impact of monetary policy on households’ cash flows. The marked increase in the share of household loans with a fixed interest rate currently shields many net borrowers from higher interest rates. At the same time, banks are slow to pass through interest rate increases to deposit rates.
As a result, the aggregate impact of the increase in policy interest rates on household’s net interest income has been fairly limited so far (Slide 14, left-hand side). At the end of last year, the average euro area household has received about €10 less per year in net interest rate income compared with a year earlier. Moreover, interest rate payments as a share of gross disposable income are still a fraction of what they were ten or 15 years ago (Slide 14, right-hand side).
The third factor relates to the labour market.
One of the greatest social benefits of the fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine is its impact on the labour market. Employment in the euro area has never been higher, and unemployment never been lower.
Yet, labour demand remains exceptionally strong. The ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers remains close to its historical high (Slide 15, left-hand side). Surveys point to continued employment growth in the coming months.
Put differently, one of the key channels in policy transmission – if not the most important one – is currently not working as usual.[31]Structural factors, such as the rise in sick leave, the higher share of services in value added and a shortage of workers, are contributing to this.
But demand is playing a key role, too. In the services sector, for example, the share of firms reporting demand as a factor limiting business remains close to historical lows.
A tight labour market, in turn, increases the bargaining power of workers in an environment in which wages are already expanding at a historically high pace. If wages increased by more than currently projected, paired with potentially lower productivity, firms would be more likely to pass on higher labour costs to consumer prices.
This risk is corroborated by evidence that, as inflation increases, prices and wages become less sticky – that is, they are adjusted more frequently, as the cost of keeping them unchanged increases (Slide 15, right-hand side).[32]
In such an environment, whether a wage-price spiral will unfold will ultimately depend on the ability and willingness of firms to absorb higher unit labour costs in their profit margins. This, in turn, depends on the economic environment in which firms operate, and hence on monetary policy.
Recent work by Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard has examined the role of labour market tightness for the United States.[33]Their work suggests that unless the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers falls back below its pre-COVID level, inflation is unlikely to return to target in the next three years.
Policy implications and conclusions
All in all, the risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, reflecting both supply- and demand-side factors. The question is how monetary policy should take such risks into account. The IMF has recently issued a clear recommendation: if inflation persistence is uncertain, risk management considerations speak in favour of a tighter monetary policy stance.[34]
There are two reasons for this.
First, the costs of protecting the economy from upside risks to inflation are comparatively small, as the policy rate can be brought back to neutral levels faster than if policymakers acted under the assumption of low inflation persistence (Slide 16, left-hand side).
Second, it is very costly to react only after upside risks to inflation have materialised, as this could destabilise inflation expectations and thus require a sharper contraction in output to restore price stability (Slide 16, right-hand side).
A monetary policy stance that errs on the side of determination “insures” against costly policy mistakes caused by inflation being more persistent than expected. Such an approach is called “robust”.[35]
Simple Taylor-type policy rules offer another angle to illustrate the monetary policy implications of underestimating inflation persistence. These rules have well-known limitations, so that their predicted interest rate levels should not be taken at face value. Nevertheless, they yield useful insights about the directional bias of policy when facing inflation uncertainty.
These rules suggest that the optimal interest rate path would have been steeper, and outside the range of paths prescribed by a variety of rules at the time, had we been able to correctly anticipate the future path of inflation in June 2022 (Slide 17, left-hand side).
This also has implications for policy today, as inflation forecast errors correlate strongly over time, as shown by a recent analysis by the Bank for International Settlements (Slide 17, right-hand side).[36]In other words, the fact that we underestimated inflation persistence last year raises the probability that we are also underestimating inflation today.[37]
These findings confirm new research showing that a narrow reliance on projections can lead to large policy mistakes, and that, as a result,giving more weight to observable data, in particular at times of high uncertainty, can improve the quality of policy decisions.[38]
Taken together, this means that we need to remain highly data-dependent and err on the side of doing too much rather than too little. Risks of both a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and weaker monetary policy transmission suggest that there is a limit to how long inflation can stay above our 2% target.
We thus need to keep raising interest rates until we see convincing evidence that developments in underlying inflation are consistent with a return of headline inflation to our 2% medium-term target in a sustained and timely manner.
Thank you."

Remarks by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the G30 dinner in Amsterdam
Amsterdam, 16 June 2023
Inflation has been coming down, with the latest data showing a broad-based decline. But it is still projected to remain too high for too long. In our latest projections, Eurosystem staff expect headline inflation to average 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Staff have also revised up their projections for core inflation, which they now see reaching 5.1% in 2023, before it declines to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025.
This revision is due to past upward surprises in inflation and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. Specifically, we expect both wages and employment to continue growing strongly over the projection horizon, while output growth will be weaker this year and next. In this context, labour productivity growth will be lower and rising unit labour costs are likely to put upward pressure on inflation.
This assessment of price pressures is also confirmed by real-time indicators of underlying inflation. Exclusion measures and indicators that capture the persistent effects of energy are showing signs of softening. But the wage-sensitive components of core inflation remain strong and domestic inflation is rising. This configuration suggests that the external drivers of underlying inflation – namely rising energy costs and supply bottlenecks – are easing, but domestic factors – i.e. wage pressures – are becoming increasingly important.
At the same time, our monetary policy is working to rein in inflation pressures. We have already undertaken a sizeable policy adjustment, and this is now starting to be felt along the transmission chain. First, we are seeing our past rate increases being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions. Borrowing costs have increased steeply and growth in loans is slowing. In April, lending rates reached their highest level in more than a decade, standing at 4.4% for business loans and 3.4% for mortgages.
Second, our monetary policy is also starting to be transmitted to the demand components that are typically more sensitive to interest rate changes: housing and business investment, as well as durable consumption goods. This is one reason why we are seeing a pronounced divergence between weakening manufacturing and resilient services. The strengthening transmission of policy tightening to the economy helps explain why inflation is projected to decline further towards our target, since it will increasingly dampen demand.
Taking into account our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission, the Governing Council decided yesterday to raise interest rates again by 25 basis points. That means we have now raised rates by 400 basis points in less than a year. This is testament to our determination to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner.
We also confirmed that our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. In other words, we still have ground to cover. Barring a material change to our baseline, it is very likely that we will continue to increase rates at our next policy meeting in July.
Thereafter, we will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council also confirmed that it will discontinue the reinvestments under the asset purchase programme as of July 2023."

CRR3/CRD6: key last step to fully leverage on the lessons learned from the global financial crisis
It is a great pleasure to take part in this seminar about the outstanding Basel III reforms in Europe.
These rules have been developed and agreed upon at international level by central banks and bank supervisors, in response to the lessons from the global financial crisis.
One important lesson has been that banks tend to downplay their risks using internal models. The core of the 2017 reforms – the output floor – ensures that a limit is established on how much banks can tweak their risk profile using their internal models. This is an essential achievement.
I will focus my remarks today on the fact that we need to protect this achievement, and we need to continue drawing lessons for our EU banking framework, including from the recent episode of bank stress.
Benefits of strong regulation and supervision
The recent episode of stress in the US and Swiss banking sectors reminded us of the importance of strong regulation and strong supervision. It was a wake-up call highlighting the merit of sticking to the agreed standards. There are many lessons that can be drawn from this episode. Let me focus on three in relation to finalising our banking framework, the CRR3 and CRD6.
First, we have seen that a strong regulatory framework eventually pays off. Euro area banks have been remarkably resilient in response to the pandemic, the Russian war and the recent episode of bank stress. Significant banks’ common equity tier one capital ratio stands at 15.3% on average, with liquidity well above regulatory minima. We have also seen improvements in the diversification of funding sources and bank profitability. At the same time, resilience of the euro area banking to the latest episode of stress should not lead to complacency.
Second, we have seen that weakening the regulatory framework can create systemic risks. Pockets of vulnerability can emerge easily, particularly where standards are not applied fully. And these vulnerabilities can quickly grow into broader financial stability risks. In this context, let me comment on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the LCR. Some attention has been paid to this element of the Basel framework and whether meeting the LCR would have helped the stressed banks. The LCR should not be considered a tool in isolation to measure and address liquidity and funding risks. To the contrary, the turbulence this spring shows that the Basel framework – which has regulatory and supervisory pillars – needs to be seen and be implemented, in its entirety. For example, in the ECB, the check of regulatory measures such as the LCR is complemented by additional supervisory liquidity risk monitoring.
A third and important lesson from the recent episode is that trust issues can develop and spread more quickly in the digital age. Bank runs can happen faster than in the past. This makes it even more important to have bank managers’ commitment to sound bank business models, because they are a precondition for trust. Bank management matters in establishing trust in business models. We need a tough rulebook which allows supervisors to check and react to bank management-related issues.
Priorities for the Banking Package
Coming to the topic of today, what should we focus on for finalising the EU banking package? Two key priorities emerge from the above learnings.
First, only strong rules will lead to strong banks. I am particularly concerned about those areas where the legislation proposals for the capital requirements regulation (CRR3) would deviate from Basel III – especially on the risk-weights for loans to unrated corporates. These deviations lower the impact of the output floor on banks’ required capital. In fact, on average, all proposed deviations together would more than halve the effect of the introduction of the output floor on banks’ required regulatory capital, and even lower the required regulatory capital for some banks compared to the status quo.
It is of particular concern that in some of the proposals these deviations are even suggested to be made permanent. Watering down the safeguards provided by agreed global standards now would send a detrimental message not only on the future resilience of EU banks, but also regarding the EU’s commitment to international agreements.
A similarly concerning issue is the intention by some trilogue parties to reintroduce prudential filters on the accounting of unrealised losses on government bonds. These have been in place in the EU until the end of 2022 on account of a systemic exemption during the pandemic crisis. They need to be strictly limited to exceptional crises times and now is not the time to reintroduce them.
As a second priority, I call on you to empower and trust prudential authorities. Only strong supervisors can implement strong supervision and exercise the required scrutiny. Here I am concerned about the reluctance to grant the ECB a stronger and more adequate role as a gatekeeper in ensuring that only suitable and experienced managers can take up top positions at banks, especially at large ones. Ensuring that managers are “fit and proper” for their job is key for sound and robust governance. The recent episode of bank stress has shown that culture matters and that banks need to be properly managed, as otherwise trust erodes.
In addition, I am concerned that all proposals still impose freezes on the macroprudential buffers of a bank when the output floor becomes binding. This is allegedly to avoid double-counting of risks. But here again, legislators should trust the macroprudential authorities to ensure that both buffers are calibrated appropriately. Macroprudential buffers cater for system- or sector-wide risk, while the output floor caters for bank-specific risk.
On a positive note, we welcome the inclusion of environmental, social and governance risks more explicitly in banking regulation, as this will grant supervisors more adequate tools to require banks to address these risks more effectively. We also welcome the new rules on third-country branches, which aim to avoid unregulated and unsupervised activities that could pose risks to financial stability in the EU.
Conclusion
Let me conclude. Finalising Basel III in EU legislation is crucial to keep our banks safe in an ever-changing macro-financial environment. We should do so faithfully, without deviations, to underpin our commitment to a resilient banking sector in Europe. I strongly welcome the intention of the Swedish and Spanish Presidencies to finalise CRR3 and CRD6 still this year, to ensure an entry into force on 1 January 2025. Targeting this date will also keep the EU aligned with the plans in other major global jurisdictions, so that we cross the finishing line together after this over ten-year endeavour to strengthen the global banking system. Only by upholding strong regulation and powerful supervision, will we ensure strong and stable banks in the EU."

Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Annual Joint Conference of the European Commission and the European Central Bank on European Financial Integration
Brussels, 7 June 2023
It is a great pleasure to be participating in this year’s joint conference on financial integration. This event offers an excellent opportunity to reflect on key developments in the financial sector over the past year and to reassess priorities for advancing the integration, development and safety of the financial system.
Recent developments and the euro area banking sector
In recent months, bank failures in the United States and Switzerland have affected financial markets worldwide. This “real-life stress test” has provided valuable insights and lessons for the euro area banking sector and for our regulatory and supervisory framework.
The European banking sector has proven resilient. And the enhanced regulatory and supervisory framework put in place following the great financial crisis has proven its worth. But it is still incomplete – the Basel III agreement still needs to be transposed into EU banking regulation in a full and timely manner. We cannot be complacent.
During the recent bank failures, deposits were withdrawn much faster than during the great financial crisis. Silicon Valley Bank lost more than USD 40 billion – almost 30% of its deposits – in a single day. The extraordinary speed of deposit withdrawals was driven by the widespread use of online banking and the rapid dissemination of news via social media and was compounded by the highly concentrated customer base.[1]In this ever-faster digital world, banks, supervisors, central banks and legislators need to review the tools for safeguarding liquidity conditions and financial stability.
The turbulence seen in financial markets this spring is a timely reminder of the benefits of strong regulation and supervision. While adequate regulatory standards are the first line of defence against bank failures, they must be supported by a second line of defence in the form of steady, powerful and agile supervision.
Harmonised and effective supervision and an enhanced resolution framework
ECB Banking Supervision has successfully developed and promoted harmonised supervisory practices. It started to closely monitor risks related to rising interest rates when the first signs of inflationary pressures emerged, long before the bank failures in the United States. The European Commission[2]and the European Court of Auditors[3]recently confirmed that the ECB has established itself as an effective and mature supervisory authority, and the ECB has already started to implement their recommendations.
The EU has made considerable progress in crisis management by establishing a robust framework for dealing with banks in financial difficulties. While they are not a direct response to the recent turmoil, we strongly welcome the European Commission’s proposed changes to the crisis management and deposit insurance framework. In particular, we support expanding the scope ofthe resolution framework to ensure that the failure of small and medium-sized banks can be addressed in a more effective and harmonised way. At the same time, ensuring adequate resolution funding is critical to make resolution feasible for smaller banks. This includes using deposit guarantee schemes to help unlock access to the Single Resolution Fund and introducing a single-tier depositor preference. The proposals form a coherent package which must be preserved in its entirety. We call on the co-legislators to adopt it swiftly, preferably during the current institutional cycle.
The events of this spring have demonstrated the need for effective and agile crisis management frameworks for banks of all sizes. To complete the crisis management toolkit for large banks in the EU, we also need to make progress in other areas, such as liquidity in resolution and a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.
The missing third pillar of banking union
The large gap in our institutional framework is still the missing third pillar: the European deposit insurance scheme. As long as deposit insurance remains at the national level, the sovereign-bank nexus will continue to be a source of fragmentation in the banking union, as the level of confidence in the safety of bank deposits may differ across Member States. In a crisis, we run the risk of deposit outflows towards other Member States and non-banks, thereby exacerbating systemic liquidity stress. An incomplete banking union is a key vulnerability for the EU banking sector and hampers progress towards greater financial system integration.
Furthermore, as firms broaden their funding sources and diversify away from bank loans, there needs to be a greater focus on financing through marketable debt securities and equity instruments. This lies at the heart of the capital markets union (CMU) project.
Implications for the capital markets union
Completing the CMU is essential for three reasons.
First, the CMU strengthens the resilience of the euro area economy through private risk-sharing.
Deep and integrated capital markets provide opportunities for effective risk-sharing. This is essential for financing the real economy and limiting fluctuations in economic activity. However, recent ECB analysis shows that, while euro area capital market integration has improved over the last 20 years, it remains rather modest.[4]
We must also consider the challenges posed by climate change in the coming years. Enhancing the risk-sharing potential of capital markets will help to further improve the ability of the EU financial system to sustain investment flows during climate-related shocks. This will bolster the EU’s overall resilience to increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events, which typically hit regions asymmetrically.
Second, further developing EU capital markets boosts innovation, supports long-term growth and enables continued financing of the green transition.
This is of paramount importance as the EU navigates rapid technological change and is faced with an increasingly challenging geopolitical environment. The public sector cannot shoulder all the investment required for the green and digital transitions on its own.[5]Capital markets have a key role to play in allocating the private investment required and in complementing the financing provided by banks.
Equity financing – especially venture and growth capital – plays a central role in funding innovative firms. Given equity investors’ greater risk appetite, a larger share of equity financing may be needed to drive green innovation. ECB research suggests that an economy’s carbon footprint shrinks faster when a higher proportion of its funding comes from equity rather than debt financing.[6]
The EU still lags behind its global peers when it comes to developing venture capital markets. Although it has grown in recent years, EU venture capital relative to GDP is still only a fifth of that of the United States. Public investment at the European level can play an important role in crowding in private investment, while coordinated public-private investment can play a crucial role in kick-starting innovation. Furthermore, the EU and its Member States should strengthen their support for initiatives aimed at providing financing to small and medium-sized enterprises or funding EU-based start-ups and scale-ups.
On the plus side, we are already seeing substantial growth in sustainable finance. Although sustainable finance products still only account for a small share of euro area capital markets[7], assets under management of environmental, social and governance funds have tripled since 2015 while the volume of outstanding green bonds has risen tenfold. Promisingly, green bonds are roughly twice as likely as other European bonds to be held cross-border[8], and investments in environmental, social and governance funds appear to be more stable than those in conventional funds.[9]This incipient evidence suggests that, with the right regulatory framework in place, scaling up green finance will be beneficial in supporting both the low-carbon transition and financial integration in the euro area.
Third, the capital markets union and the banking union are intrinsically linked. More integrated capital markets support cross-border banking activities, while more cross-border holdings would allow banks to diversify, making them more resilient. From issuance to underwriting, banks provide essential services for capital markets. Therefore, a more resilient and integrated banking system also supports the smooth functioning and further integration of capital markets.
Key legislative initiatives to advance capital markets integration
To move forward on the legislative front, we need to finalise the implementation of the Commission’s capital markets union action plan – without compromising on its ambition. This includes implementing proposals such as the consolidated tape, the targeted harmonisation of insolvency rules and the upcoming initiative on the withholding tax framework.
We welcome the recent statement made by the co-legislators in April, in which they committed to finalising CMU legislative initiatives during the current institutional cycle, and the recent agreement on the European Single Access Point. The ESAP will help to mobilise and allocate capital by making it easier for investors to identify suitable firms and projects to invest in. Likewise, the proposed targeted harmonisation of insolvency regimes should make it easier to reallocate resources from failing firms and provide more transparency for cross-border investors. Finally, a more efficient and harmonised withholding tax framework will reduce the burden and costs for investors and facilitate cross-border investment.
Beyond the current institutional cycle and the CMU action plan, EU legislators should also look at structural issues, such as improving the current architecture to enable more consistent and harmonised supervision of markets.
Conclusion
The euro area financial system recently passed a real-life stress test. At the same time, the events of this spring underlined the importance of making decisive progress on the European banking union and capital markets union projects. The financial market turbulence and contagion from the United States and Switzerland would have been far more muted had we been closer to our goals. Completing the banking and capital markets union projects will increase cross-border bank lending and enhance the dynamism of public and private equity markets. Both are key to enhancing integration and stability in the euro area financial system, and they will also ensure that the funding for the green and digital transitions is available to meet the challenges ahead.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 5 June 2023
It is a pleasure to be with you again today for our second regular hearing this year and immediately after celebrating the ECB’s 25th anniversary.
I am delighted that several members of this Parliament were able to join the celebrations in Frankfurt a few days ago, reflecting the close and fruitful dialogue our institutions have always maintained. Since the ECB’s creation in 1998, members of its Executive Board have attended over 100 hearings before this Parliament. This engagement has been central to the ECB’s accountability and has contributed to the euro becoming a currency that our fellow citizens trust.
Let us now turn our attention to the current matters at hand. Let me start by providing a brief overview of the economic outlook before going on to discuss our latest monetary policy decisions.
Growth in the euro area nearly stalled in early 2023. Activity is being supported by lower energy prices, easing supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support to firms and households.
As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. The ECB welcomes the European Commission’s recommendation to Member States to wind down in 2023 the fiscal measures taken in response to the energy price shock.
Domestic demand, especially consumption, remains weak.
Business and consumer confidence indicators point to weak activity in the second quarter and remain lower than before Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people. We see a divergence across sectors of the economy. The manufacturing sector is still working through a backlog of orders, but its prospects are worsening. Meanwhile, the services sector remains resilient, owing in particular to the reopening of the economy after the pandemic.
Household incomes are benefiting from fiscal support measures and the strength of the labour market, with the unemployment rate having fallen to a new historical low.
Looking at inflation, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, headline inflation has declined from its October peak and stood at 6.1% in May. While base effects have led to some variation in energy inflation in recent months, the rate declined to -1.7% in May. Food price inflation remains elevated but is decreasing and stood at 12.5% in May, down from 13.5% in April.
Price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food declined to 5.3% in May from 5.6% in April. Upside pressures on both headline and core inflation are still coming from the pass-through of past energy cost increases and supply bottlenecks, which are nonetheless expected to fade gradually. The latest available data suggest that indicators of underlying inflationary pressures remain high and, although some are showing signs of moderation, there is no clear evidence that underlying inflation has peaked.
Wage pressures have strengthened further as employees recoup some of the purchasing power they have lost as a result of high inflation. Moreover, in some sectors firms have been able to increase their profit margins on the back of mismatches between supply and demand and the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation.
High inflation is putting a strain on people living in the euro area. As energy inflation – which imposed a notable burden on low-income households – declines, the inflation differential between low and high-income consumers starts to fade away. Nevertheless, high food inflation continues to weigh on low-income households in particular. We are fully committed to fighting inflation and we are determined to achieve its timely return to our 2% medium-term target. This commitment to price stability contributes to economic growth and employment in the medium term and hence to reducing inequality.
In the light of the ongoing high inflationary pressures, in our May meeting we decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. We also announced that we expect to discontinue the reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP) as of July 2023.
Our rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions for firms and households, as can be seen in rising lending rates and falling lending volumes. At the same time, the full effects of our monetary policy measures are starting to materialise. Recent ECB staff analysis indicates that the effects of monetary policy tightening on real activity and inflation can be expected to strengthen in the coming years, but our assessment is surrounded by significant uncertainty.[1]
Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our policy rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in the light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
As requested by you, let me now discuss the financial stability outlook. Financial stability is a pre-condition for price stability and vice versa.
Financial stability in the euro area has proved robust so far, but we continue to assess possible risks, taking into account a wide range of indicators.[2]
Euro area banks' exposure to the recent banking sector stress which arose in other regions has been limited. But challenges to funding and asset quality may weigh on future profitability. More broadly, as financing conditions tighten, we will gain more insight into the resilience of euro area firms, households and banks.
The medium-term orientation of our monetary policy strategy allows us to consider financial stability in monetary policy decisions if this supports the pursuit of price stability. Conversely, price stability remains as crucial as ever for durably preserving financial stability.
We do not see a trade-off between financial stability and price stability in the euro area. Over time, the pursuit of price stability through monetary policy, and of financial stability primarily through macroprudential policy, are complementary. In addition, the ECB has the tools to provide liquidity to the euro area financial system if needed to preserve financial stability and the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
We remain committed to price stability. And to support financial stability, it is essential that you, as co-legislators, make tangible progress towards completing the banking union and that you strengthen regulatory policies to further enhance the resilience of the euro area financial sector.
Allow me to conclude.
In 1998, former ECB President Willem Duisenberg stressed that the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) should be open, transparent and accountable, noting that “the most important challenge for the ESCB is to win the confidence of the citizens of Europe”.[3]
25 years on, this is still an important challenge, and we are working hard to further foster trust in our institution. But the ECB cannot do this alone. Today’s dialogue with you, who represent the people of Europe, is essential to that endeavour.
This is why I am delighted that I have just signed, together with the President of the European Parliament, an Exchange of Letters between our two institutions. Building on our close and fruitful dialogue over the past 25 years, this Exchange of Letters will allow us to better structure our interactions and facilitate effective cooperation.[4]
Together we must do all we can to keep listening and responding to concerns of European citizens.
Thank you. I now stand ready to take your questions."

Welcome address by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the meeting of the Council of Presidents of BusinessEurope
Madrid, 1 June 2023
Yesterday we published the latest edition of the ECB’s Financial Stability Review, which is issued twice a year. In my remarks today, I will provide you with the main findings of our analysis.
Two key developments have shaped the macro-financial environment over the past six months. First, there has been some improvement in the growth and inflation outlook since late last year. Macro-financial conditions have improved on the back of a robust post-pandemic recovery, fading global supply chain disruptions and lower energy prices. At the same time, the outlook remains fragile, given downside risks to growth and relatively sticky core inflation.
A second key recent development concerns financial turbulence witnessed this spring, with the spotlight increasingly turning on systemic risk concerns following bank failures outside the euro area. Strains in the US and Swiss banking sectors in March introduced an element of stress into a highly uncertain environment. While the fallout experienced by euro area banks was limited, these events have served as a timely reminder of just how much the preservation of financial stability depends on the shock-absorption capacity of the financial system. All the more so in an environment where financing conditions are being tightened to tackle elevated inflation around the world.
Framed by these recent developments, our current assessment is that financial stability vulnerabilities in the euro area remain elevated.
Tighter financing conditions to address high inflation have contributed to a reappraisal of the economic outlook alongside an orderly reversal of overly compressed asset price risk premia.
Euro area bank fundamentals are solid, thanks to the strength of banks’ capital and liquidity buffers under stringent regulation and supervision. At the same time, continued improvements in asset quality and profitability are contributing to bank resilience.
But there is no room for complacency.
Bank liquidity challenges could yet intensify. Rolling over maturing bonds is pushing up banks’ market funding costs, while competition for deposits is likely to rise and translate into faster deposit repricing. Haircut and margining risk has also increased due to higher volatility in government bond markets. Muted economic growth and signs of weakening credit quality pose downside risks to bank earnings. The outlook for banks has thus become more uncertain, with liquidity asset quality concerns surfacing.
The non-bank financial sector could also see such risks. While this sector has remained resilient during the recent banking sector stress and market volatility, its exposure to liquidity and credit risks remains high. If investment funds were to experience any sudden liquidity needs, they could amplify adverse market dynamics via procyclical selling behaviour and forced asset sales, thereby introducing risks to wider financial stability. Strains in the non-bank sector, which is an important source of bank funding, could also give rise to additional banking sector vulnerabilities via liquidity and credit risk spillovers.
Past events, such as the pandemic-related turmoil in March 2020 and the UK gilt market stress in the autumn of 2022, also vividly illustrate how non-banks can amplify margin call dynamics in the wider financial system, especially when coupled with excessive leverage.
On the side of the non-financial sector, the improvement in macroeconomic developments I noted at the outset have provided key support. At the same time, our assessment underpins how tighter financial conditions are testing household, corporate and sovereign resilience.
A strong labour market with unemployment at historical lows has supported household income. But higher interest rates and the squeeze in real income due to high inflation are increasingly compromising household debt servicing capacity. This is reflected in an increase in consumer loans classified by banks as suffering a significant deterioration in credit quality.
Robust revenues and high profit margins have contributed to strong corporate results. But firms are also being challenged by tighter financing conditions and the repercussions in terms of the availability and cost of funding. Euro area firms have benefited from high profits on the back of a sharp post-pandemic recovery and lower energy prices. Yet not all firms have benefited equally from the recovery. Highly indebted, energy-intensive and pandemic-sensitive sectors have often been unable to increase profit margins. Adverse developments in the corporate sector would have knock-on effects on bank balance sheets and household employment prospects.
Turning to sovereigns, short-term fiscal pressures remain contained. But medium-term challenges are adding to financial stability risks. Fiscal fundamentals remain fragile in some euro area countries, given their high debt levels, rising funding costs and high short-term refinancing needs. As government bond yields have increased sharply across the euro area, higher funding costs will ultimately weigh on sovereigns. At the same time, higher than expected deficits combined with lower growth are limiting fiscal space and may put debt dynamics on a less favourable path, especially in countries with high debt levels.
In view of all of the above vulnerabilities, it is clear we are seeing a general turning of the financial cycle. This is also becoming increasingly evident when looking at the euro area real estate sector. A clear downturn is visible in commercial property markets, while after several years of expansion, signs of correction – albeit far less pronounced – are also now apparent in the residential property market.
While an orderly price correction in residential real estate might be warranted, a disorderly fall in prices would pose systemic risks. Rising interest rates on new mortgage lending would increasingly compromise affordability and add to the interest burden on existing mortgages, especially in countries where variable-rate mortgages predominate.
At the same time, valuations have continued to decline in commercial real estate markets in the euro area. An even more pronounced adjustment in such markets could expose structural vulnerabilities in some open-ended property funds, increase credit risk for lenders and lower collateral values.
Let me conclude.
Against the background of low growth, high inflation and rising interest rates, signs of a turn in the financial cycle are clearly emerging.
As the likelihood of financial stability risk materialising has increased, the Financial Stability Review notes that, in the light of elevated uncertainty amid accumulated vulnerabilities and a turning financial cycle, macroprudential policy should continue to focus on ensuring the resilience of the financial system. While there are some indications of credit supply tightening, driven by higher risk perception and funding costs, capital requirements are not constraining bank lending, as banks continue to exhibit sizeable capital headroom.
In fact, many euro area countries have enhanced macroprudential policies since the pandemic, which has also helped greatly to strengthen bank resilience. Maintaining macroprudential buffers now preserves the ability of authorities to release such buffers in response to potential future shocks and support the supply of key services to the real sector at that time.
Turning to the non-bank financial sector, the increasing risks posed by this lightly regulated sector, with strong links to banks, requires a comprehensive macroprudential approach to address structural vulnerabilities, notably in investment funds – especially targeting liquidity mismatches and overall leverage.
The stress in US and Swiss banking markets has highlighted structural fragilities and demonstrated the greater speed at which liquidity problems can emerge in the financial sector. At the same time, it has revealed that the incomplete banking union is a source of vulnerability for Europe’s banking sector. The lack of a complete banking union still represents a very wide gap in the EU’s institutional framework.
Thank you for your attention."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at “Deutscher Sparkassentag 2023”, Hanover
Frankfurt am Main, 1 June 2023
Hanover is a city of great significance.
Ludwig Erhard once described it as the emblem of German ambition and vitality. And, over the years, Hanover has been justifiably proud of its role in Germany’s industrial development.
Nowhere is this more obvious than at the Hannover Messe.
Since inception in 1947, Hannover Messe has showcased the passion and economic potential of German workers and entrepreneurs to the world. The fair has become a symbol of the GermanWirtschaftswunder, intimately linked to post-war German reconstruction and the subsequent economic and industrial success.
Success in which the German savings banks have played a pivotal role.
With a history spanning 200 years, you have consistently served as a reliable financial partner, supporting and promoting the German industry through crises and transformation. It is no wonder that around three out of four businesses in Germany are customers of the savings banks.[1]
And your business is also the intersection point of our monetary policy and the economy.
We depend on banks to transmit our policy to firms and households – in good times and in bad. Our changes to interest rates feed through into bank lending rates, altering people’s propensity to spend and invest – and ultimately the path of growth, employment and inflation.
In this sense, even though we have different goals, we are partners in the pursuit of price stability.
Today, inflation is too high and it is set to remain so for too long. We are determined to bring it back down to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner.
That is why we have hiked rates at our fastest pace ever – and we have made clear that we still have ground to cover to bring interest rates to sufficiently restrictive levels.
These hikes are already feeding forcefully into bank lending conditions, including here in Germany. And we know that – having hiked so far and so fast – considerable tightening is still in the pipeline.
But it remains uncertain just how much stronger the transmission of our policy will be.
So, we need to continue our hiking cycle until we are sufficiently confident that inflation is on track to return to our target in a timely manner. At the same time, we need to carefully assess the strength of monetary policy transmission to financing conditions, the economy and inflation.
In my remarks today, I would like to look at what we have done so far to fight inflation and explain the factors that will determine our future decisions towards bringing inflation down.
The distance covered so far
Since the outset of the pandemic, the euro area has been hit by a series of sudden, overlapping and self-reinforcing shocks which, together, have sent inflation soaring.
Shocks to the supply side – notably the supply bottlenecks created by the pandemic, the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis – have raised input costs for firms.
And this has been felt particularly hard here in Germany, where businesses have seen delivery times reach historic highs, critical materials are in short supply and producer prices for energy – despite recent falls – are still much higher than they were in January 2021.[2]That was an important reason why the economy fell into recession over the winter.
At the same time, shocks to demand, especially the surge in spending as the economy reopened, have allowed firms to pass on these costs to prices much faster and more strongly than in the past. In combination, these shocks led to headline inflation in the euro area exceeding 10% at one point last year.
The ECB entered this period with a highly accommodative policy that had been geared to fighting a decade of too-low inflation and the deflationary risks created by lockdowns. But once we had clear evidence that the inflation outlook was shifting, we changed tack completely – and rapidly.
Already in December 2021, we announced that we would discontinue net asset purchases under the bond buying programme we had introduced during the pandemic, and would gradually reduce net asset purchases under the previous asset purchase programme.[3]
Then, as inflation accelerated in early 2022, we announced that we would conclude net purchases under all our purchase programmes even sooner. As a result, even before we began raising policy rates, longer-maturity market rates had moved up by almost 200 basis points.[4]The battle had begun.
We started rate hikes in July 2022 and, since then, we have raised rates by 375 basis points in less than a year – from -0.5% to 3.25% today.
So, we have moved in a deliberate and decisive way to fight inflation. And though inflation is still too high, this rapid policy adjustment has put us in a different position today.
Think of an airplane climbing to cruising altitude.
At the start, the plane needs to ascend steeply and accelerate fast. But as it gets closer to its target altitude, it can reduce acceleration and retain its existing airspeed. The plane needs to climb high enough to reach its destination – but not so high as to exceed it.
Similarly, when we began hiking rates out of negative territory, in all scenarios there was a steep ascent ahead and so it made sense for us to move rapidly.
Now, we are approaching our cruising altitude – and that means we need to climb more gradually, using the speed that we have already built up behind us.
This analogy helps explain why, at our last meeting in May, we raised interest rates again – making clear that we were not there yet. But we also reduced the pace of rate hikes to a more standard increment of 25 basis points.
How much higher do we need to go?
That will depend on our assessment of the incoming data. And to help the public understand what sources of information will matter to us for these decisions, we have clarified our reaction function.
Three factors will be decisive: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Let me explain how we currently assess each one.
The inflation outlook
First, given that interest rate changes affect the economy with long lags[5], we look at the inflation outlook. Our best tool for doing so is the ECB's staff projections, which offer a comprehensive picture of the inflation path over the medium term, taking into account all relevant economic and financial information.
To be sure that we have set the right monetary policy, we want to see inflation returning to 2% in our projections in a timely manner. This timeliness is important because the longer inflation remains above our target, the greater the risk that it infiltrates people’s expectations.
In March, we projected annual average headline inflation to be 2.1% in 2025 – still slightly above our target. And we did not see year-on-year inflation rates returning to 2% until the second half of 2025. At our last meeting in May, we judged that the incoming data broadly supported those projections.
On the basis of these past projections we cannot yet say that we are satisfied with the inflation outlook. But we will have a new set of projections at our meeting on 15 June, and these will give us an updated picture incorporating the additional policy tightening since then.
In any case, in the uncertain and volatile environment we face today, it would not be wise to condition our policies solely on medium-term projections, which are surrounded by too much uncertainty. That is why our reaction function has a second element – the dynamics of underlying inflation.
Underlying inflation
Underlying inflation refers to the slow-moving part of inflation which, when temporary shocks have faded, will persist into the medium term. Therefore, by looking at underlying inflation, we can be more confident that inflation is on the right path. And it has an important benefit – measures of underlying inflation can be observed in real time.
However, there is no clear evidence that underlying inflation has peaked. To date, all measures monitored by the ECB are still strong. And whether they remain so will depend mainly on the balance between two forces: energy prices and wages.
On the one hand, as energy is an important input into every economic activity, the sharp rise in energy prices last year has fed through to all prices – including those that make up our various measures of underlying inflation.
But energy prices have dropped considerably since then, which should have the opposite effect. HICP energy inflation in Germany fell from 44.2% in September 2022 to 9.4% in April 2023.
This decline in energy costs for both consumers and producers should, in turn, limit firms’ ability to further raise profit margins, which has been a key factor driving recent price pressures in the euro area.[6]Consumers are less likely to accept disproportionate price rises when they know that firms are saving on their energy bills.
On the other hand, mounting wage pressures are becoming a more important driver of inflation. So far, workers have faced a significant loss from the erosion in overall labour income caused by the energy crisis. In the euro area, real wages at the end of last year were still around 4 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels.
But labour markets across the euro area are tight and workers have considerable bargaining power, which they are starting to use to recoup these losses.
This is especially visible here in Germany, where labour shortages reached historic highs in the second half of last year,[7]leading to strong wage agreements in many sectors. Wage growth in Germany increased from 3.9% in the fourth quarter of last year to 5.1% in the first quarter of this year.[8]
To be clear: a period of catch-up wage growth need not cause unduly persistent inflation over time – if the costs of the energy shock are ultimately shared in a balanced way between firms and workers. But if we start to see what I have called “tit-for-tat” inflation[9]– with both parties trying to offset any real income losses[10]– we could see a negative spiral taking hold.
Monetary policy transmission
The ECB cannot allow this to happen. And since profits are ultimately influenced by the business cycle, it is our responsibility to restrict demand enough to prevent such a spiral. That should, in turn, lead to slower margin growth and lower wage demands while reducing pressure in the labour market.
But to gauge whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, we need to know how much traction our policy tightening is having – and is likely to have – on spending in the economy.
That is why policy transmission is the third element we are looking at.
So far, our rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to bank borrowing[11]and lending rates – faster even than during previous hiking cycles. For the euro area, bank lending rates to firms currently stand at 4.2%, up by 267 basis points since May last year. This is their highest level since January 2009.
Bank lending volumes are also weakening, leading to a sharp contraction in money growth. From November onwards, monthly lending flows to firms have been negative on average. Money (M3) has also seen negative flows, causing its year-on-year growth rate to plunge from almost 12% in mid-2020 to 1.9% in April this year.
And banks report that credit standards are tightening, which heralds lower lending flows to come. In the ECB’s latest bank lending survey, the pace of net tightening in credit standards was at its highest level since the sovereign debt crisis in 2011.[12]
This is the desired effect of our policy: we want financing conditions to tighten. And, so far, it has not been at the expense of bank performance, with the positive impact of higher rates on banks' interest margins outweighing the negative impact on volumes.[13]
But we know that our rate hikes have not yet been fully reflected in financing conditions. And we are also aware that recent financial market tensions may have intensified the tightening by increasing bank funding costs and encouraging more risk aversion.
So we need to monitor carefully how this pass-through process is playing out. And if the recent tensions do leave a lasting footprint on markets, a given level of rates would mean tighter financing conditions – and that would have to be reflected in the level at which rates peak.
At the same time, there is also uncertainty about how tighter financing conditions will affect the economy, and whether the effects will be stronger or weaker than in the past.
Firms have not faced a steep rise in funding costs for more than a decade, while the economy has changed considerably in that time – and may still be changing after the pandemic. This means that we need to observe closely the impact of our measures over time.
We might already be seeing some early indications of their effects across sectors.
A marked divergence has emerged between manufacturing activity, which looks to be contracting, and services, which are expanding – especially in the leisure and tourism sectors.
This can largely be explained by continued reopening effects: people are consuming more of the services they were denied during the pandemic, such as travel and eating out, while spending less on goods that they stocked up on during lockdowns.
But monetary policy may also be playing a role. Tighter financing conditions may already be constraining households’ total spending, forcing them to substitute between sectors.
And spending on durable goods is likely to be more affected by higher financing costs, as some of these are typically bought on credit. By contrast, for this summer at least, our consumer surveys show that tighter monetary policy is not going to affect people’s holiday plans.[14]
As our rate increases percolate through the economy, we will get a clearer picture of how much the tightening we have already done is biting – and how much more is needed to ensure that inflation is decisively squeezed out of the economy.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The motto of the Sparkassen is “Weil’s um mehr als Geld geht”. And this, in many ways, also applies to the ECB.
Our job is to create money and to preserve its value. But we do so because, in the long run, price stability produces the best and fairest outcomes for people and businesses.
Today, to return to my analogy, the airplane is still climbing – and it will keep going until we have enough speed to glide sustainably and land at our destination.
But the reaction function we have laid out will help to strike the right balance for our monetary policy decisions in the future: between further tightening to tame inflation on the one hand and uncertainty about the speed and strength of policy transmission on the other.
One thing, however, is certain: we will keep moving forward – determined and undeterred – until we see inflation returning to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner."

Introductory remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECON Committee of the European Parliament
Brussels, 25 May 2023
I am pleased to be back before the ECON Committee to present the ECB’s Annual Report for 2022[1], which we have published today together with our written feedback on the resolution on our activities you adopted earlier this year.[2]
These documents, as well as today’s hearing, are fundamental for the ECB’s accountability relationship with this Parliament. We greatly value this dialogue with you as it allows us to reach out to the public, which is especially important in times of high inflation.
In my remarks today, I will first focus on the outlook for the economy and the appropriate monetary policy response. I will then discuss the importance of a resilient financial system in supporting the real economy.
The outlook for the economy and the appropriate monetary policy response
The euro area economy grew modestly in early 2023. Activity is being supported by lower energy prices, easing supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support to firms and households. But domestic demand, especially consumption, remains weak.
Headline inflation declined from its October peak and stood at 7.0% in April. Core inflation remains elevated, partly because of input cost pressures. Upside risks to inflation stem from, among other things, higher than expected wage and profit margin growth, and a potential lasting rise of longer-term inflation expectations above our target. Downside risks relate to possible renewed financial market tensions and weaker demand, due for example to a more marked slowing of bank lending or a stronger transmission of monetary policy.
As the inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long, we decided at our May meeting to raise our key policy rates again, by 25 basis points. We also announced that the Governing Council expects to discontinue reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP) as of July this year. While our key interest rates are the primary tool for setting our monetary policy stance, the reduction of the APP portfolio also helps to normalise monetary policy.[3]
While the speed and scope of our policy tightening since last July has already been unprecedented, our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determine the appropriate level and duration of restriction, taking into account the highly uncertain environment. To this end, our policy decisions will be based on the assessment of the inflation outlook in the light of incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of our monetary policy transmission.
One important factor for the future inflation outlook is the behaviour of fiscal policy. As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium term.
The importance of a resilient financial system
Despite the very strong tightening cycle, financial stability in the euro area has proved robust so far. But we of course continue to monitor the situation, taking into account a wide range of indicators.
Vulnerabilities in euro area financial markets were shown up by recent stress in the banking sector in other regions, which led to market reactions here too, although such spillovers were mitigated by solid euro area bank fundamentals. These tensions were short-lived, however, owing to prompt interventions by the authorities in the United States and Switzerland.
Tighter credit conditions are testing the resilience of euro area firms, households and sovereigns, while the possibility of sudden changes in property prices, especially in commercial real estate, remains a concern. We are also closely monitoring non-banks, which – given their interconnections with banks − can amplify shocks within the financial system.This highlights the need to strengthen the regulation of non-banks, in part by taking a more comprehensive macroprudential approach that would ensure their resilience while avoiding the risk of creating blind spots within the financial system.[4]
Our banking sector is strong today, largely thanks to the reforms and prudential policies implemented over the past years. However, the recent events should remind us to consistently attune our regulatory framework to the times – doing so, among other ways, by monitoring and reacting to new developments such as crypto-assets, digitalisation and the impact of social media.[5]
For our part, we have been working at international level with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)[6]and the Financial Stability Board[7]to assess what can be learned from the recent events. We have also helped to define the BCBS standard for the prudential treatment of banks' crypto-asset exposures.[8]
Your role as co-legislators will be crucial in keeping our framework robust.
First, your role is vital in fully implementing the final elements of Basel III faithfully and without delay, as this best guarantees the safety of our banking system. We are very concerned about the numerous deviations from the Basel standards introduced in the EU banking package and think they should be avoided.
Second, we need to swiftly implement in EU law the aforementioned BCBS standard for the prudential treatment of crypto-asset exposures. We need to be ambitious and make rapid progress, in particular on the envisaged exposure limit to reduce contagion between crypto and banks.
Third, it is imperative that we complete the banking union – the European Commission’s proposal on crisis management and deposit insurance is an important step towards this goal.
Conclusion
Let me now conclude.
We are going through a period of high uncertainty marked by a sequence of economic and geopolitical shocks and trade fragmentation. The best way to protect stability in the EU is to ensure closer European integration and a solid regulatory framework.
In the coming twelve months before this parliamentary term ends, we can make tangible progress on some key dossiers.
First, on fiscal policies, we very much welcome the Commission’s legislative proposals for the reform of the EU’s economic governance. A well-functioning governance framework is essential from an economic, monetary and financial stability perspective.
Second, on financial sector policies, we need to make progress on the Basel III reforms, crypto-asset standards, and the crisis management package – along the lines just outlined.
Third, on banking union, the lack of a European deposit insurance scheme is a source of vulnerability; completing the banking union is essential to pave the way for a stronger and more prosperous Europe.
Thank you for your attention. I now stand ready to take your questions."

Opening remarks by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the celebration to mark the 25th anniversary of the ECB
Frankfurt am Main, 24 May 2023
It is a pleasure to welcome you to this reception marking the 25th anniversary of the ECB and the Eurosystem.
Helmut Kohl, the former German Chancellor, once famously observed that “peace means more than just an absence of war”. And at its root, the story of the euro is one of building the foundations for lasting peace.
It is a story that stems from Europe’s far-sighted decision after the Second World War to bind its economies together so tightly that our futures would be inseparable, and which, in turn, created the powerful logic underpinning European integration.
This engine of integration meant that whenever we faced trials, we did not retreat into division and let what we had built together fail. Instead, we met those challenges head on and answered them together.
And it was this same spirit that made – from the late 1980s onwards – the single currency a necessary next step on our European journey.
At that time, both Europe and the world were changing.
First, our common market was evolving into the Single Market. This made it even more important to remove the prospect of competitive devaluations among major economies, since that would have undermined trust and turned the tide against openness.
But with global capital flows multiplying, Europe’s fixed exchange rate system was becoming increasingly unstable – a problem epitomised by the exchange rate mechanism crisis in 1992-93.
Second, the global integration of finance was also threatening Europeans with a loss of monetary sovereignty. The monetary policies of large countries that issued global currencies – especially the United States – were exerting ever-larger global effects.[1]
Regardless of the exchange rate regime used, this meant that the scope for smaller countries to set monetary conditions in line with their domestic needs was gradually narrowing.
Third, as the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War ended, there were new, fundamental questions being asked about the direction of Europe – and who would hold sway within it. That created a powerful need for new European symbols that could tie people within a larger and more diverse Union.
The euro was the logical answer to all three of these changes. It offered Europeans stability, sovereignty and solidarity.
Stability, because the euro ensured that the Single Market could be insulated from currency fluctuations while making speculative attacks on euro area currencies impossible.
Sovereignty, because adopting a single monetary policy at the European level would increase Europe’s policy independence vis-à-vis other large players.
Andsolidarity, because the euro would become the most powerful and tangible symbol of European unity that people would encounter in their day-to-day lives.
The euro through the crises
We can be grateful for the foresight of Europe’s visionary founders. When the euro was born on 1 January 1999, they could never have imagined the crises that lay ahead.
The first President of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg, faced 9/11 and the dotcom crisis. His successor, Jean-Claude Trichet, had to navigate the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in its early days, which my predecessor, Mario Draghi, inherited. He had to contend with fears about the future of the euro area, followed by a prolonged period of too-low inflation.[2]
And my own Presidency has already seen the pandemic and economic lockdown, Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, the energy crisis and the return of too-high inflation.
Yet the fundamental promise of the euro has held true. And thanks in no small part to our monetary union, we have been able to weather it all – and come out just a bit stronger each and every time.
First, the euro has brought us stability.
With stable exchange rates, the Single Market – and the commitment to peace it represents – has not only survived; it has thrived. One can only imagine how tempting protectionism would have been if the possibility of competitive devaluations had not been eradicated.
The euro has also shielded us from external shocks. Soon after its launch, it quickly established itself as the world’s second reserve and invoicing currency. As a result, the price of more than half of what we trade is now denominated in euro, and for the other half, the single currency has helped insulate the economy from excessive exchange rate volatility.[3]
As an illustration, ECB staff estimates suggest that, had the euro not been introduced, the depreciation of some euro area countries’ currencies against the US dollar could have been up to 14% larger during the global financial crisis and up to 10% larger during the pandemic.[4]
Of course, instability has arisen in other areas that were missing from the original design of the euro area, most painfully during the sovereign debt crisis. But where gaps have appeared, they have been filled, most importantly through the creation of European banking supervision.
Second, the euro has increased our sovereignty, allowing us to be the master of our own economic destiny and to set the monetary policy that Europe needs for stable prices and sustained growth.
Thanks to our single monetary policy, the ECB has been able to respond quickly and decisively to every kind of shock we have faced. And we have done so even when other large jurisdictions were pulling in a different direction.
This was perhaps most visible when the US Federal Reserve System began a tightening cycle in 2013 while the euro area was still recovering from the sovereign debt crisis. Our policy independence allowed us to chart our own course and begin a recovery that lasted for 26 straight quarters.
Third, the euro has created solidarity within Europe.
It has provided a symbol of unity through incredibly testing times, and motivation to support each other through the darkest of hours. And for this reason, new countries continue to join.
Over the past quarter of a century, we have welcomed nine new countries to the euro area, bringing us from 11 to 20 – with the most recent, Croatia, joining at the start of this year.
We have now reached a position where people can separate institutions from policies – which in my view is the hallmark of success. They may like or dislike the policies of the ECB, but they mostly no longer question whether being part of the euro area is the right choice.
While the share of people who support the euro hit a low of around 60% during the sovereign debt crisis, that figure is now close to 80%.[5]And the depth of this support has also been demonstrated at the ballot box whenever membership of the euro area has featured in national elections.
Looking forward
But this success does not mean that our work is done. It means that we are now in a position to make the best choicesforour monetary union – rather than about having a union at all.
It is now time for the next chapter in the euro’s story to be written. And that will depend on the actions that we, as Europeans, undertake.
For the ECB, our immediate and overriding priority is to bring inflation back down to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. And we will do so.
But as I recently said, faced with shifting geopolitics, digital transformations and the threat of a changing climate, there will be more challenges ahead which the ECB will need to address. We must continue to provide stability in a world that is anything but stable.[6]
And we are also counting on other policymakers to do their part. A monetary union is not an end point – it is a constant process of uniting. Each generation of leaders must continue it. Union should be multifaceted – and include fiscal, financial and banking dimensions to develop a higher degree of integration, especially if the euro is to cement its international status.
When Wim Duisenberg accepted the Charlemagne Prize on behalf of the euro in 2002, he portrayed the euro as a triple contract.[7]
It is a contract between countries to pool their strength. A contract between the ECB and the people of Europe to deliver on their needs, most of all price stability. And a contract between Europeans themselves to share their common currency.
But a contract does not only grant rights – it also assigns responsibilities. And now it is up to all of us – leaders, institutions and citizens – to continue to honour this contract for many years to come."

Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) and Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) 3rd Annual European Financial Integration Conference
Frankfurt am Main, 23 May 2023
In recent years, the global economy has been hit by a series of unprecedented shocks – including a pandemic, the outbreak of war, and an energy crisis. And with geopolitical tensions on the rise, we may see the frequency of such shocks even increase.
The prospect of an increasingly shock-prone economy means that it has never been more important to ensure the financial sector is resilient to challenges that come its way. And today,I would like to share some thoughts on financial integration in the euro area, focusing on the important role of the non-bank financial sector in the euro area financial system.
The importance of the financial system for the economy
A strong and integrated financial system is essential to support the growth and resilience of the euro area real economy.
Well-developed and broad capital markets can help to efficiently allocate capital to the most innovative and productive companies, thereby contributing to economic growth.Market-based finance also allows companies to diversify their funding sources and facilitates increased cross-border funding. This can result in greater risk-sharing across the euro area and contribute to overall financial resilience. Investment funds, for instance, play an important role in financial integration.[1]However, if we are to strengthen the euro area financial sector’s capacity to attract and intermediate funding for euro area companies, we must make further progress on the banking union and continue to develop the capital markets union (CMU).
The CMU seeks to integrate national capital markets into a genuine single market, in turn making financing more accessible to EU companies and transforming Europe into an even more attractive place to save and invest. Consequently, this means scaling up market-based financing in the EU, leading to a larger role for the non-bank financial sector than is already the case.
The changing role of market-based finance in the euro area
It has been almost ten years since the Financial Stability Board published its policy recommendations on strengthening the oversight and regulation of the non-bank financial sector.[2]And since then, we have seen the sector grow significantly.
In the euro area, the combined total assets of investment funds, money market funds (MMFs), insurance corporations, pension funds and financial vehicle corporations have doubled since the global financial crisis from €15 trillion to €31 trillion.
The sector has become increasingly important in financing the euro area real economy in recent years. As a share of credit granted by all financial institutions[3], credit granted by non-banks to euro area non-financial corporates has almost doubled since 2008, from 15% to 26% at the end of last year.[4]
The growing role of non-banks offers the benefit of diversifying sources of finance and can thereby help to ensure a smooth provision of funding to the real economy.[5]Evidence also suggests that a higher share of non-bank finance can help economies to recover faster from recessions,[6]when banks’ ability to lend may be impaired.[7]
Crucially, however, the benefits of this diversification rely on making sure that the non-bank financial sector provides a stable source of funding, ensuring robust financing for companies in both normal and stressed market conditions.
Liquidity and leverage – lessons from recent market events
As the market footprint of non-bank financial institutions increases, new risks and vulnerabilities can arise. Let me discuss three in particular.
First, the strong growth of the non-bank financial sector – especially the asset management industry – over the past 15 years has been accompanied by an increase in liquidity mismatches.
A key contributing factor is that investors in open-ended funds – which account for the largest part of the investment fund sector – can typically redeem their shares on a daily basis without prior notice. This creates a liquidity mismatch especially in funds that invest in relatively illiquid assets, such as high-yield corporate bonds.
Liquidity demand has become more procyclical as a result, especially during periods of financial market stress. During the pandemic, we saw how liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds increased demand for market liquidity, which amplified stress in financial markets.[8]
The second vulnerability in the non-bank financial system relates to financial and synthetic leverage, which can amplify shocks and create spillover risks for banks.
We saw an example of this with Archegos Capital Management, which defaulted on its losses from leveraged equity trades in March 2021. The fact that Archegos used total return swaps to generate synthetic exposures highlights another challenge in identifying leverage, as leverage can be embedded in derivative exposures.[9]While the Archegos default had only a limited impact on the broader financial system, the event nevertheless highlighted possible contagion channels to banks through the provision of synthetic leverage by prime brokers.
The third vulnerability in the non-bank sector results from an insufficient preparedness to meet large demand for liquidity, especially from margin calls – as the recent stress episode in the UK pension fund sector has highlighted.
In the United Kingdom, pension funds had made extensive use of leveraged strategies to hedge long-term interest rate risk and free up capital to generate higher returns in their investment portfolios.
Many smaller pension funds had pooled their hedging activities in liability-driven investment (LDI) funds. But a sudden increase in UK government bond yields in September 2022 led to large valuation losses and margin calls, which meant these funds had to deleverage and raise additional cash from their pension fund trustees.
As a result, pension and LDI funds were forced to sell assets, including gilts, which amplified gilt market movements and liquidity stress. And in response, the Bank of England had to intervene on financial stability grounds through temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds.
While these new risks and vulnerabilities are evident, the non-bank financial sector has remained largely stable in recent months, despite the stress in the banking sector that emerged in March.
Fund investors shifted their exposure from higher to lower risk assets, especially from high-yield corporate to government bond funds. Portfolio de-risking has also been evident in insurance corporations and pension funds, as higher interest rates have reduced incentives for the non-bank financial sector to search for yield.
But there are no grounds for complacency here. Structural vulnerabilities from liquidity mismatches and leverage remain elevated despite recent de-risking. Moreover, bank and non-bank financial institutions can be closely interconnected through funding channels, ownership linkages and common risk exposures.
The non-bank financial sector remains particularly exposed to asset price corrections and credit risk should corporate sector fundamentals deteriorate substantially. In addition, non-banks’ exposure to property markets has increased markedly in recent years, rendering institutions vulnerable to ongoing price corrections in real estate markets. Fragile risk sentiment and elevated vulnerabilities in parts of the non-bank financial sector could amplify negative shocks.
Strengthening the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation
Given the vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector, it is vital to further enhance its resilience, also from a systemic perspective.
To date, the macroprudential policy framework has mainly focused on the banking sector, while the policy framework for non-bank financial institutions still needs to be enhanced. This means that there are fewer safeguards for non-banks, and risks can grow largely unchecked.
With this in mind, let me highlight four areas where I see a need for further regulatory efforts in the non-bank financial sector.
First, we need to reduce the risks of mismatch between funds’ asset liquidity and their redemption policies. Funds need to ensure that their redemption policies are closely aligned with the liquidity of their portfolio assets.
For instance, funds that invest in illiquid assets, such as real estate or private debt, should have commensurate redemption notice periods to mitigate liquidity risk. At the same time, funds that offer daily redemptions should be required to invest in sufficiently liquid assets and maintain high liquidity management standards to enable them to meet redemption requests under both normal and stressed market conditions.
This should be complemented by enhancing the availability and use of anti-dilution liquidity management tools to pass on the costs of redemptions to redeeming investors. Moreover, higher liquidity buffers would be useful to manage increased liquidity needs during periods of market stress, including from margin calls.
Second, we must renew our efforts to reform the MMF sector in the EU.
After the market turmoil in March 2020, proposals to enhance the resilience of the MMF sector were developed at the international and European level. These focused on removing regulatory threshold effects, strengthening MMF liquidity requirements, and improving the availability and usability of liquidity management tools.[10]In the EU, however, reforms of the MMF Regulation have not progressed to date. They should be pursued as a matter of priority, while ensuring a globally consistent approach.
Third, it is essential to address risks from non-bank leverage from various perspectives.
A key priority should be to develop a globally consistent approach to addressing risk from both financial and synthetic leverage in the non-bank financial sector. Further improving data quality and coverage and information sharing are central to assessing leverage-related risks across non-bank financial sector entities and activities. This work should be complemented by identifying gaps in policy frameworks globally, especially where financial entities are not subject to adequate leverage rules.
Fourth, there is a need to enhance margining practices and liquidity preparedness to meet margin calls. Since the March 2020 market turmoil, the non-bank financial sector has been repeatedly confronted with periods of high market volatility and surging liquidity needs from margin calls.
Increasing the transparency and predictability of initial margin models and assessing their responsiveness to market stress can help reduce the procyclical demand for liquidity. In addition, ensuring robust liquidity risk management and contingency planning frameworks would mitigate risks associated with inadequate liquidity preparedness.
More generally, we must recognise the cross-border dimension of activities and regulatory developments in the non-bank financial sector and the importance of global coordination. For example, the new guidance recently proposed by the US Financial Stability Oversight Council facilitating the designation of non-banks as systemically important demonstrates that these issues are being considered outside of Europe. It is vital that work to identify and address systemic risks is carried out jointly across countries, taking a macroprudential perspective rather than solely focusing on the soundness of individual entities.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In the past decade, we have seen the role that non-banks play in financing the euro area economy become increasingly important. While this is a welcome development in terms of promoting financial integration and supporting economic growth, it also entails increased risks for the financial system. Interconnectedness between the banking and the non-bank financial sector remains high, increasing the scope for contagion.
Given these growing risks, the policy action undertaken to date is becoming ever more insufficient. Indeed, there seems to be a general inertia in the adoption of policy recommendations on non-banks. That has to change. The lack of policy action today may mean the materialisation of risks tomorrow. In particular, a more comprehensive macroprudential framework should be a priority to ensure that non-banks are more resilient and able to provide a stable source of funding to the real economy in both good and bad times.
Thank you."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Conference on Financial Stability and Monetary Policy in the honour of Charles Goodhart
London, 19 May 2023
Over the past years, we have seen a fundamental change in the macroeconomic environment.[1]After years of low inflation and low interest rates, inflation has come back with a vengeance, reaching double-digit rates in some countries.
After some initial hesitation, central banks around the world have responded forcefully to the inflationary threat, leading to a rapid and broadly synchronised tightening of monetary policy across advanced and emerging economies (Slide 2, left-hand side). In the euro area, too, the pace of rate hikes has been unprecedented (Slide 2, right-hand side).
This rapid change has caught many by surprise. In December 2021, market participants still expected policy rates to remain in negative territory until the end of 2024, virtually unchanged relative to the end of 2019 (Slide 3). The unexpected sharp rise in interest rates has exposed fragilities in the financial system that had built up over the long period of low interest rates, adding to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.
The rise in financial stress is visible in the ECB’s composite indicator of systemic stress (CISS), which started to soar in tandem with long-term interest rates (Slide 4, left-hand side). Implied volatility in the bond market also rose well above its longer-term average, driven to a large extent by uncertainty about future monetary policy, while implied volatility in stock markets remained contained (Slide 4, right-hand side).
Since the start of the unexpected sharp hiking cycle, we have witnessed repeated episodes of financial distress in different parts of the world.
Many of them are in one way or another related to the quickly changing interest rate environment.[2]Historically, global interest rate hiking cycles often coincided with bank or other financial distress (Slide 5).[3]
For central banks, this raises the question of what the risk of financial instability implies for their policy choices at a time when inflation, and underlying inflation in particular, remains stubbornly high, suggesting the need for further policy tightening.
In my remarks today, I will discuss this question, starting from the “separation principle”, which posits that monetary policy stance considerations can be separated from financial stability concerns. I will then look at some of the more recent financial disturbances to see whether such separation worked in practice. Finally, I will consider current challenges for the euro area financial system and draw some lessons for the future.
In conclusion, I will argue that recent history has shown that, even in high-inflation periods, separation between monetary and financial stability considerations can be ensured if financial disturbances are caused by market dysfunction and liquidity issues rather than solvency concerns. A fundamentally sound, well-regulated financial sector protects central banks from any form of financial dominance, allowing them to focus on their primary mandate of price stability.
The separation principle in ECB history
The “separation principle” can be interpreted as an application of the Tinbergen rule, which says that achieving a certain number of targets requires the policymaker to control at least an equal number of instruments.[4]
It implies that, if the central bank has different instruments at its disposal, its actions to safeguard financial stability need not impinge on its ability to maintain price stability.
This principle first appeared in ECB communication at the height of the global financial crisis when policymakers stressed that ample liquidity was provided in order to ensure the proper transmission of monetary policy, whereas the monetary policy stance was controlled by conventional interest rate policy.[5]
In later years, the separation principle was invoked to clarify the distinction between the use of “standard” (i.e. interest rates) and “non-standard” measures, emphasising that longer-term liquidity operations and asset purchases were not thought of as tools to steer the monetary policy stance.[6]Accordingly, purchases under the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), introduced in 2010, were fully sterilised via reverse repurchase operations. The same would apply to the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) if they were ever used.
This distinction became unsustainable when inflation remained stubbornly below the 2% target and interest rates were approaching the effective lower bound. In order to fulfil our price stability mandate, the ECB began using asset purchases also for monetary policy stance reasons, complemented by forward guidance on interest rates.
Thereby, the previous formulation of the separation principle – framed as a distinction between conventional tools calibrated to deliver price stability and non-conventional tools designed to preserve smooth market functioning – became obsolete.[7]
This view was reinforced by the monetary policy strategy review of 2021, which confirmed the regular use of formerly “non-conventional” tools for monetary policy in certain circumstances, namely when interest rates are already close to their effective lower bound.[8]
The strategy review also pointed to macroprudential regulation and supervision, which had been adopted as one major lesson from the global financial crisis, as the first line of defence against the build-up of systemic financial risks.
If macroprudential policy was fully effective, the Tinbergen principle would also apply here, allowing monetary policy to focus only on price stability, while macroprudential policy would target systemic stability.[9]
However, the strategy review acknowledged that macroprudential policies are unlikely to be fully effective, primarily due to inaction bias and the lack of such policies for the non-banking sector.[10]
Therefore, given that financial stability is a precondition for price stability, and vice versa, there is a clear case for the ECB to take financial stability considerations into account in its monetary policy deliberations even in the presence of macroprudential policies.[11]
The question therefore remains under what conditions the separation principle can be maintained, implying that both objectives – monetary and financial stability – can be reached via central bank actions.
Recent applications of the separation principle
To understand how the separation principle has been applied in practice, it is useful to consider how the ECB and other central banks have responded to financial disturbances since the beginning of the pandemic.
During the pandemic, financial stability risks materialised in a manner that avoided a trade-off between monetary policy stance and financial stability measures.
The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) was announced at the onset of the pandemic when financial stress increased sharply, liquidity dried up and volatility hit levels last seen in 2008.[12]
The CISS suggests that the PEPP stabilised financial market functioning and helped restore investor confidence, likely preventing a severe financial crisis that would have had dramatic consequences for the economy in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand side). Prices and wages would probably have fallen significantly, which would have run counter to our price stability mandate.
Quick and decisive action by the ECB was essential to prevent market dysfunction, and it was also in line with the desired monetary policy stance, as an expansionary monetary impulse was needed to counter the projected sharp drop in inflation (Slide 6, right-hand side).
Hence, when confronted with financial instability in the middle of a deflationary shock, there is typically no need for separation. The same tool could, in principle, be used for the two purposes.
However, the PEPP was designed in a specific way that supported financial stability: It provided flexibility – implying that asset purchases could be allocated flexibly over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions.[13]This essential feature of the PEPP helped to protect the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area at a time when sovereign spreads diverged rapidly beyond what could be justified by economic fundamentals (Slide 7, left-hand side). After the announcement of the PEPP, in conjunction with an emerging agreement on fiscal support at European level, sovereign spreads normalised.
The active use of flexibility was needed only in the early stages of the pandemic. Once the market stress subsided, its active use was no longer required, as can be seen from the swift decline in the deviations from the ECB’s capital key (Slide 7, right-hand side).
Over the following two years, the macroeconomic backdrop changed fundamentally. After a short spell of negative annual inflation rates in the euro area at the end of 2020, inflation started its sharp upward trend.
While the rise in inflation and inflation expectations was initially welcomed because it allowed the euro area to leave behind the long period of too low inflation, the mood gradually turned, giving way to concerns about steadily increasing inflation.
After repeated upside surprises to inflation, which cast increasing doubts on the narrative that inflation would revert to target by itself once the supply-side shocks had faded out, the desired monetary policy stance shifted from broad expansion to sharp tightening.
In line with the pre-announced sequencing, the ECB first discontinued its net asset purchases under the PEPP and the asset purchase programme (APP), before embarking on interest rate hikes.
However, after the Governing Council had in June 2022 announced its intention to start raising interest rates at its next monetary policy meeting, a negative inflation surprise in the United States was sufficient to trigger sharp and fundamentally unjustified movements in sovereign bond markets, which raised fears of self-reinforcing dynamics that could lead to severe market dysfunction (Slide 8, left-hand side).[14]
A new programme, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), was created to prevent financial market fragmentation and ensure a smooth transmission of our monetary policy stance across the entire euro area at the time of policy normalisation. At the same time, it explicitly sought to avoid any interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The new tool allowed for purchases of public sector securities, but only in jurisdictions that fulfilled a list of eligibility criteria. This was to ensure that the programme would only be used in countries with sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies.[15]
The TPI complemented the PEPP’s in-built flexibility, which also allowed shifting reinvestments flexibly over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions.
Again, the PEPP’s flexibility was actively used only over a short time span.
Meanwhile, the TPI has unfolded its power without being used. The mere option of activating the TPI helped to halt the disorderly and unwarranted rise in sovereign spreads. It restored the smooth transmission of the monetary policy stance across all euro area countries.
Since the announcement of the TPI, sovereign spreads have been range-bound and rather insensitive to shifts in rate expectations, despite repeated tightening shocks over the past year as the historically unprecedented sharp interest rate hiking cycle proceeded (Slide 8, right-hand side).
It is probably fair to say that such a steep hiking cycle would not have been possible in the euro area in the absence of the TPI. In that sense, the new tool to ensure smooth transmission was a precondition for tackling the inflation problem forcefully and preventing a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.
Therefore, this episode can be seen as an example of successful separation.
Another example from the high inflation period is the Bank of England’s intervention in the autumn of 2022 to address dysfunction in the long-dated UK government bond market.
In an environment of globally elevated volatility in financial markets due to central banks’ efforts to fight high inflation, the new UK government's announcement of its “mini budget”, which comprised historic tax cuts and a sharp rise in public borrowing, caused a massive repricing in the gilt market.[16]
This exposed risks at leveraged liability-driven investment (LDI) funds, requiring them to sell large volumes of gilts in an already illiquid market, which threatened to give rise to a self-reinforcing price spiral (Slide 9, left-hand side).
Responding to these financial disturbances, the Bank of England announced a strictly time limited and targeted backstop purchase facility in line with its statutory financial stability objective, specifying that it would carry out purchases of long-term UK sovereign bonds to restore market functioning. These purchases were announced to be reversed in a timely but orderly manner via asset sales.[17]
The operations were explicitly designed to deal with financial instability. In fact, the Bank of England emphasised that these operations were not to be seen as a deviation from the general monetary policy stance, which foresaw the start of active sales from the monetary policy bond portfolio in the light of the persisting threat to price stability.
The Bank of England was able to restore market functioning quickly through its interventions, while it also managed to start active asset sales from its monetary policy portfolio (Slide 9, right-hand side). The balance sheet expansion due to the LDI episode was short-lived and did not put into question the general monetary policy stance.
In that sense, the Bank of England’s response can be seen as another successful application of the separation principle.[18]
Since March of this year, a series of bank failures has shaken the US financial system. In early March, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which had lent heavily to start-up companies, was closed down, followed two days later by the closure of Signature Bank.[19]
As in the TPI episode, the turbulences were related to monetary policy. The sharp hiking cycle exposed the risks that had built up at SVB over time, due to its failure to properly manage its interest rate and liquidity risks and a lack of sufficient supervisory scrutiny.[20]
Two key factors led to SVB’s demise.
The first was its peculiar deposit structure. The bank’s deposits came mainly from very large, uninsured investors who were highly concentrated in the venture capital and technology sector, exposing SVB to synchronised and rapid withdrawals, amplified and facilitated by social media and digitalisation (Slide 10, left-hand side).[21]
The second issue was the composition of its asset side. SVB had high holdings of long-term US government bonds that were classified as “held-to-maturity” (HTM) assets, implying that they were not marked to market.[22]At the time of purchase, these securities appeared to be low risk and highly liquid, with a safe return well above typical deposit rates.
However, the rapid rise in interest rates led to a sharp increase in unrealised mark-to-market losses in SVB’s bond portfolio, which raised doubts about the bank’s solvency and triggered a run by its depositors (Slide 10, right-hand side).[23]
This also implied that temporarily providing liquidity would likely have been ineffective as the underlying problem was one of insolvency, rather than illiquidity. In the end, equity and debt holders were wiped out, while even large, uninsured depositors were spared from losses.
In order to stabilise the overall banking sector, the Federal Reserve swiftly established the bank term funding programme (BTFP), which accepts devalued high-quality collateral at par without haircuts.[24]Effectively, it provides liquidity at rates lower than market funding.
The liquidity provision via different facilities partly reversed the reduction of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, while quantitative tightening continued as planned (Slide 11).
Thanks to the prompt and decisive response by US policymakers, the crisis did not evolve into a full-fledged banking crisis. However, as shown by repeated disturbances, regional banks remain vulnerable.
The SVB case differs from the other episodes in two respects:
First, the underlying cause was more related to insolvency than illiquidity.[25]In such cases, liquidity injections by central banks are likely insufficient, implying that governments need to step in.
Second, compared with LDI, the problem was more widespread as similar vulnerabilities were shared by other regional banks, albeit to a lesser extent.[26]
In such circumstances, the separation principle is harder to maintain.[27]
Current challenges for the euro area financial system
The recent banking turbulence immediately spilled over to the euro area. Bank stocks and financials’ bond prices dropped sharply, and bond market volatility soared. However, tensions were short-lived and remained largely confined to the banking sector.
A decomposition based on a dividend discount model shows that the sell-off of euro area bank stocks after the SVB failure reflected a sharp and sudden increase in risk premia amid contagion fears rather than a deterioration in euro area bank fundamentals. In fact, banks’ earnings outlook continued to improve in the aftermath of the banking turmoil, overall offsetting the massive increase in the discount rate (Slide 12, left-hand side).
Euro area bank stock prices are now well above their 2022 average, suggesting that equity investors perceived banks to be net beneficiaries of higher interest rates.
This is confirmed by euro area banks’ return on equity, which has not only recovered from the low levels recorded during the pandemic but has reached levels not seen in a decade (Slide 12, right-hand side).
The resilience of the euro area financial system can largely be attributed to the greatly improved prudential framework, reflecting concerted international action taken since the global financial crisis.
The euro area banking sector displays strong liquidity and capital ratios, much higher than before the global financial crisis (Slide 13).[28]
Risks from unrealised losses on marketable securities are likely to be moderate for euro area banks on average, as central bank reserves account for the largest part of liquid assets.
However, there is no room for complacency as financial stability risks may be hidden below the surface of relatively calm financial markets and benign regulatory ratios.[29]
After all, the dramatic and unexpected shift in the macroeconomic environment affects all institutions conducting maturity transformation, albeit to different degrees depending on their business models.
Financial regulation may not always sufficiently capture such risks. One key example is interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB), which has not been included under the Pillar 1 capital requirements of the Basel Accord. In the current regulatory framework, it is up to supervisors to decide how interest rate risk is to be reflected in banks’ capital requirements. In the euro area, there has been a strong focus on interest rate risks over recent years, including a dedicated stress test in 2017 and a thematic review last year.[30]
Such analyses show that, in the short run, most euro area banks tend to benefit from higher interest rates, which boost banks’ margins and net interest income due to the slow and partial pass-through of higher rates to depositors.
The pass-through of higher rates to deposits, and hence the boost in net interest income, depends on the deposit structure. The pass-through tends to be larger for term deposits than for overnight deposits. Moreover, firm deposits tend to be more responsive than household deposits (Slide 14, left-hand side).
The positive effect of higher interest rates on net interest income has been amplified by euro area banks' increased reliance on overnight deposits over recent years, generating a higher franchise value of deposits (Slide 14, right-hand side).[31]
The changing interest rate environment is also reflected in banks’ funding structure.
Both in the euro area and in the United States, overnight deposits declined over recent months. However, in the euro area, a larger share was shifted into term deposits, and the shortfall in deposits was largely compensated for by higher bank bond issuance, keeping bank funding overall broadly stable (Slide 15, left-hand side). By contrast, in the United States, a much larger share of deposits appears to have been shifted into money market funds (Slide 15, right-hand side). While parts of those funds may have been circulated back to banks, some may have flown into the overnight reverse repo facility (ON-RRP), thereby reducing banks’ excess liquidity.
But also in the euro area, the shift from overnight deposits into higher-yielding alternatives implies that net interest margins are bound to shrink over time, as funding costs eventually rise more strongly than banks’ interest income in many cases.
As shown by sensitivity analyses to a 200 basis point interest rate shock, the impact on banks’ long-run performance is less benign than suggested by the short-run positive effect on net interest income. Due to a duration mismatch, the economic value of equity of most euro area banks drops over the long run in response to rising interest rates (Slide 16, left-hand side).[32]The analyses also show that banks’ exposure to interest rate risk has increased since the start of the tightening cycle (Slide 16, left- and right-hand side).[33]
The impact of higher interest rates on the economic value of equity is again heterogeneous and depends, among other things, on the composition of the banks’ asset side.
Banks with a higher share of mortgages are expected to experience a much sharper decline in the economic value of equity than those with a lower share (Slide 17, left-hand side). This is because mortgages were, on average, granted at low rates and with a relatively long duration, exposing banks to interest rate risk. Similarly, banks with a lower share of reserves in total assets are more sensitive to interest rate hikes, as they may be forced to liquidate marketable assets at low prices in case of withdrawals (Slide 17, right-hand side).
Taken together, the longer-run and heterogeneous impact of rising interest rates needs to be monitored carefully, including banks’ strategies to deal with those challenges.
Risks can be mitigated via hedging strategies or a larger share of variable rate loans. But hedging contracts do not offer perfect protection as they may be subject to counterparty risks. Even variable rate loans can give rise to vulnerabilities as interest rate risk may be converted into credit risk. So far, however, credit risks have not increased.
In addition, risks may also be lurking in the non-bank sector. In light of potential systemic risks emanating from them, the macroprudential framework for non-bank financial institutions needs to be enhanced.
Both banks and non-banks may be facing additional headwinds in future. Higher interest rates will eventually cool the economy, possibly leading to higher credit risks. Moreover, one can already see signs of a reversal of the overvaluation of assets observed both in real estate and in the stock market (Slide 18).
Lessons for the future: when can separation work?
Let me conclude by drawing some lessons regarding the conditions under which the separation principle can work.
The ECB has a clear mandate of price stability.
Since financial stability is a precondition for price stability, and vice versa, we need to take financial stability into account in our monetary policy deliberations.
In fact, central banks have an important role to play as lenders of last resort to deal with liquidity crises and stabilise financial markets at times of self-reinforcing dynamics.
Such interventions do not create a conflict with price stability in the presence of a deflationary shock, as shown by the PEPP episode.
But even if liquidity crises occur in high-inflation periods, tools can be designed in a smart way to ensure separation. This requires that the tools are targeted and temporary, and that the underlying issue is truly one of liquidity rather than solvency.
Monetary policymakers cannot address solvency issues, which are clearly in the realm of fiscal authorities. In fact, by doing so, they would risk overstepping their mandate and endangering their independence.
Governments and supervisors are therefore essential to enable monetary policymakers to focus on their primary mandate of price stability. A sound financial regulation and supervision are the best protection against financial dominance, just as a functioning fiscal framework is needed to protect against fiscal dominance.
This speaks in favour of maintaining or strengthening macroprudential capital buffers, being cautious on profit distributions and share buy-backs, and closing regulatory gaps, including by fully implementing the Basel III reforms.[34]
Taking financial stability into account is not just about market stabilisation. To ensure the proportionality of their monetary policy decisions, central banks need to consider potential side effects regarding the build-up of financial stability risks, even if those risks may materialise only in future.
During the years of low inflation, monetary policy encouraged risk-taking as part of its monetary policy transmission mechanism.[35]Moreover, central banks themselves underestimated the possibility of a return of persistent high inflation, which affected our monetary policy actions and shaped firms’, households’ and investors’ expectations. Central banks need to reflect on how such factors may have contributed to the build-up of financial fragilities.
In the current situation, given the resilience of euro area banks, President Lagarde rightly stresses that there is no trade-off between price stability and financial stability. The ECB can continue to do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a timely manner. This implies raising rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and keeping them at that level for as long as necessary. At the same time, the ECB has the tools to provide liquidity to the euro area financial system, if needed to preserve financial stability and a smooth transmission of monetary policy.[36]
Over the longer run, weakened bank profitability may expose the persisting problem of overbanking in the euro area coupled with a lack of pan-European bank mergers – an issue the ECB cannot solve on its own. So, the changing interest rate environment may provide a new impulse for one of the most important steps in European integration – completing European banking union.
Thank you."

Remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 18th edition of the Banking Sector Industry Meeting “Banking: Navigating the Wave of Inflation”
Madrid, 17 May 2023
Earlier this year, substantial global market tensions emerged following the failure of two mid-sized banks in the United States and the loss of confidence in Credit Suisse.
As a result, banking sector risks are now squarely back in the focus.
While market sentiment towards euro area banks had improved markedly in 2022, this reversed abruptly in March following the events I just mentioned. Market tensions led to sharp declines in euro area bank stock prices and in riskier bank bond markets, notably in the Additional Tier 1 segment.
Fortunately, turmoil in the euro area was short lived. The limited exposures of euro area banks to the sources of US and Swiss bank stress, their solid fundamentals, and the comprehensive regulatory and supervisory frameworks in place shielded them from a more severe financial unravelling.
But this shock was only the latest in a series of extraordinary events that have put Europe’s economy and banking sector to the test – the pandemic, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and the subsequent energy crisis.
It is against this background that I would like to review the last couple of months from the perspective of euro area banks. I will first highlight how they differ from their global counterparts, before turning to the complex challenges they currently face. I will then conclude by discussing how macroprudential policy and regulation can help maintain banks’ resilience.
Recent developments for euro area banks
Euro area banks’ fundamentals are solid across several key areas.
The first of these is profitability. Euro area banks’ profitability improved in 2022 and their return on equity reached almost 8%, its highest level since the start of the banking union. This improvement in earnings was followed by an increase in distributions to shareholders via dividend payouts and share buybacks. Market valuations for euro area banks also improved, with the valuation gap vis-à-vis their US peers narrowing.
The second key area is resilience. The euro area banking sector is underpinned by strong capital positions. Banks’ aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 15.3% at the end of 2022, well above the minimum requirements. And the decline in non-performing loan (NPL) stocks continued last year, with banks’ aggregate NPL ratio stabilising at 2.3% in the fourth quarter.
The third area I want to highlight is liquidity and funding. Here, euro area banks differ substantially from their global counterparts. Their average liquidity coverage ratio exceeded 160% at the end of 2022, and around half of their high-quality liquid assets are held as cash and deposits with central banks. On aggregate, euro area banks are mainly funded by customer deposits, and a relatively high share of these are covered by deposit guarantee schemes.
A challenging outlook
There is no room for complacency, however.
Economic activity in the euro area has held up better than expected and a recession at the turn of the year did not materialise. But growth is still weak and inflation continues to be too high, with underlying price pressures remaining strong. Earlier this month, the Governing Council decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing the deposit facility rate to 3.25%.
The challenging outlook heightens the uncertainties surrounding banks’ profitability and resilience.
While higher interest rates boost banks’ net interest income, the benefits could be somewhat smaller than previously anticipated given a slowdown in lending growth and the inversion of the yield curve.
For example, the latest euro area bank lending survey shows that demand for corporate and housing loans has decreased strongly, contributing to a slowdown in lending to firms and households in March. In parallel, banks’ credit standards for corporate and housing loans tightened considerably in the first quarter of 2023. As lending slows down, so does the income base banks can rely on. Importantly, however, banks’ capital positions are not currently seen to be constraining bank credit supply.
There are two sides to rising interest rates. Certainly, they have a positive impact on earnings. But on the downside, they heighten interest rate risk with larger duration gaps, which vary widely across euro area banks – not least due to differences in the share of fixed-rate mortgages.
Banks also tend to incur unrealised losses on their fixed-income portfolios during periods of increasing long-term yields. This exerts a negative effect on the value of their equity. Preliminary assessments show that, on aggregate, potential unrealised losses on bonds held at amortised cost are limited. But to gain further insights into this risk, we – together with the EBA – are using the ongoing stress test to collect data on these portfolios.
The prospect of higher funding costs also increases the downside risks to bank earnings.
In early 2023, we saw bond issuance volumes picking up amid repayments of the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and banks’ efforts to increase or maintain buffers on their minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). But bond funding costs have also risen markedly since the start of 2022. A faster repricing of deposits, on the back of heightened competition, would increase funding pressures even further.
While NPLs are at record lows, default rates on banks’ corporate credit exposures started to increase in the second half of 2022 and early warning signals of future asset quality deterioration have become more pronounced. Loans showing a significant increase in credit risk (so-called “stage 2” loans) are on the rise, in particular for consumer and other non-mortgage household loans.
Within the corporate sector, concerns are mounting about the outlook for commercial real estate (CRE) loans amid falling valuations and investor demand in CRE markets. And while the energy crisis has abated, the risks for European firms from delaying the transition to climate neutrality are still high.
Finally, elevated vulnerabilities in non-bank financial institutions may spill over to euro area banks – given that they are strongly interconnected – exposing the banks to liquidity, asset price and credit risks. These links appear on both sides of banks’ balance sheets and are stronger for large banks.
The importance of preserving resilience
So what does the current environment imply for macroprudential policy in the euro area? In view of prevailing uncertainties, macroprudential policy should focus on preserving resilience.
First, existing macroprudential capital buffers that have been built up in recent years should not be released in the current environment. This is because banks’ profitability improved considerably and, as I said earlier, their capital positions are not constraining the supply of bank credit.
Second, in the current uncertain environment, banks should remain prudent on their payouts to further support the resilience of the euro area banking system. Increasing bank payouts should not be seen as a sign of strength. Far from it. The best sign of banking system strength continues to be strong capital positions, which ensure sufficient loss absorption capacity even in adverse circumstances.
Supporting the European regulatory effort
Let me now turn to the important role of regulation.
In Europe, banks are strong today because we have applied the Basel regulatory framework to all EU banks. Indeed, recent events in other regions have shown just how important it is to have an adequate framework in place for all types of banks. Looking ahead, let me highlight three key takeaways that should guide the European regulatory effort.
First, the EU needs to fully implement the final outstanding elements of Basel III. We call on co-legislators to support the resilience of the banking sector by implementing these faithfully and without delay.
Second, we need to complete the banking union.
A month ago, the European Commission tabled a legislative proposal that will improve how we manage crises affecting mid-sized and smaller banks. This is very welcome, and we hope the legislators will rapidly adopt the proposal.
But if we are serious about completing the banking union, we also need to tackle some more ambitious elements: namely, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) and a European framework for providing liquidity to banks in resolution. Both of these would further strengthen the resilience of our crisis management framework and should therefore be a top priority for legislators.
And third: we need to see further progress on the capital markets union (CMU). Creating deeper and more integrated capital markets in the EU will provide firms with additional funding sources as alternatives or complements to bank credit. Implementing the Commission’s CMU Action Plan in full within this legislative cycle should remain one of Europe’s key goals.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Since the emergence of market tensions in March, banking sector risks have come back into the spotlight. We have seen just how rapidly financial market sentiment can change and how confidence in the banking sector can weaken substantially.
But euro area banks are weathering the storm. This is in large part due to their solid capital and liquidity positions. We should not be complacent, however. Vulnerabilities persist, and we need to closely monitor the situation to safeguard financial stability.
The recent market turbulence demonstrates the importance of implementing our banking regulatory framework in full. At the same time, macroprudential policy continues to play a vital role in ensuring the resilience of the system by maintaining or strengthening buffers.
If anything, the financial stability concerns raised by recent market tensions revealed that the incomplete banking union is a source of vulnerability for Europe’s banking sector. If the banking union had been complete, the recent contagion from the United States and Switzerland to the EU financial system would have been far more muted. The lack of a complete banking union is still a very wide gap in the EU’s institutional framework.
Thank you for your attention."

Dear Madam Chancellor, dear Angela,
Dear Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr Wüst,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a privilege to be here today to give this speech in recognition of you, dear Angela, as you receive North Rhine-Westphalia’s highest honour, the State Prize.
We are on the banks of the Rhine in the wonderful city of Cologne, the birthplace of Konrad Adenauer, once the city’s Lord Mayor and later Germany’s first Chancellor. And I know that the symbolism of this place will not be lost on you.
In important ways, the contours of your lives have overlapped. You followed in his footsteps some 40 years later, becoming the first female Chancellor of Germany. Just recently, you were awarded the Grand Cross 1st class, special issue, of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. The only other chancellors to be given such honours were Helmut Kohl and Adenauer.
As a reminder of Germany’s past and of those who came before you, you displayed Oskar Kokoschka’s portrait of Chancellor Adenauer behind your desk in the Chancellery.
But Adenauer was also a guiding light in more fundamental ways.
You share, for example, a deep understanding of and respect for the value of democracy. “Democracy is more than a parliamentary form of government,” Adenauer said. “It is a philosophy of life that has its roots in the concept of the dignity, the value and the inalienable rights of each individual human being.”[1]
Having grown up in a dictatorship, you know better than anyone that democracy and freedom cannot be taken for granted. They are hard won and easily lost. In a speech in 2021 to mark German reunification, you said “Democracy doesn’t just happen. We have to keep working for it together, every day”.[2]
And – just like Adenauer – that is what you did throughout your political career. It was what drove your leadership. You were the antidote to a growing wave of populism, which the author Moisés Naím describes as a new malignant form of power that mimics democracy while undermining it.[3]
Like Adenauer, you also stood unwaveringly for European unity, shepherding the European construction through incredibly testing times.
The reconciliation between France and Germany after the war was profoundly influenced by the friendship between Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle. It reignited the relationship between their two countries, which they deepened by signing the Elysée Treaty in 1963. They prepared the ground for the advances in European integration that followed.
Likewise, you strove to position Germany as a reliable and stable partner in Europe, anchoring the Union through crises that could have otherwise torn us apart. You knew that the futures of Germany and Europe were inseparable, and that a strong and united Europe was the best way to secure your country’s prosperity. You succeeded, despite the major challenges that arose along the way.
But, Angela, you are also you. Unique, incomparable, inimitable. I believe the success you have achieved in your remarkable career is down to three of your attributes.
First, you have a sense of curiosity and a demand for rigour that help you understand and find solutions to the most complex problems. This is what I call Angela “the scientist”.
Second, you have the humility to seek consensus when others may be held back by ego, and the finesse to bring people to an agreement. This is Angela “the pragmatist”.
Third, you have the inner strength and conviction to defend your most deeply held values when they are most at risk. This is Angela “the moral force”.
So let me explore these three qualities in more detail.
The scientist
You have spoken about the challenges of growing up behind the Iron Curtain, yet it instilled in you qualities that – seen from the outside – have been indispensable to your success. As information was strictly controlled, you developed your own sense of curiosity, seeking out everything you wanted to learn, including what the socialist regime did not want to teach you. And because openly speaking your mind was dangerous – something you understood early on – you learned to be judicious, developing a strong sense of self-reliance. You once told me that you would learn themost important information by heart – so as to leave no trace for the Stasi.
You then chose to study physics, which gave you a way to remain true to yourself, even under dictatorship. “Even under Honecker, two times two had to be four,” you said.[4]Were it not for the German Democratic Republic, you would have liked to teach languages.[5]Instead, you did your PhD in quantum chemistry and started working at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin.
Then, something happened that you didn’t expect. The wall came down, peacefully. “The biggest surprise of my life is freedom,” you said in your inaugural speech at the Bundestag in 2005. “I expected many things, but not the gift of freedom before my retirement age.”[6]
Suddenly, you were free to do as you pleased. You left physics and entered politics,rising rapidly through the ranks. You were voted into the Bundestag in 1990 and soon became Minister for Women and Youth in Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s cabinet.
You wanted to shape the future of this newly reunited Germany. And yet, since a life in politics had never been your plan, you brought with you the analytical rigour of your scientific training, the curiosity of the researcher, and an unyielding search for the truth.
I was immediately struck by this when our paths first crossed at a meeting between the French and German Governments in 2005, shortly after you were sworn in. I remember thinking how refreshing it was to meet a woman chancellor, especially one so young, fearless, and brilliant.
I was Minister of Trade in the delegation of President Jacques Chirac. We discussed the launch of the first joint French-German history book for schoolchildren. You praised the initiative, saying that it would deepen the friendship between France and Germany. “Everything starts with education,” you said.
And you, Angela, are the living proof of this.
The pragmatist
But it is not enough in politics to knowwhatto do. One must also knowhowto do it. The statesmen and women that history remembers are those who marry a careful analysis of the situation with an ability to rally others and bring about change.
This is you in a nutshell, Angela.
The fact that you hit your stride so quickly in politics– to the surprise of many of your male colleagues –was because you had a different approach: less ego-driven, and more results-oriented. You were a pragmatist in the truest sense of the word, engaging deeply with complex problems, identifying the space for agreement, and then being able to bring people together to find solutions.
This is one of your key strengths – and something I could tell you also enjoyed. During G20 meetings, for example, you would get up and talk to other leaders around the table. You would listen, discuss and negotiate. You would walk over to the colleagues drafting the communiqué for the meeting, taking out your pen, crossing out sections and making sure that key sentences were included.
I have never seen any other leader do this – and at many key moments it proved critical.
Thanks to your inclusive and consensus-driven style, you were instrumental in forging a compromise when Greece’s future in the euro area was on the line. We held a crisis meeting during one weekend in July 2015. The meeting went on well into the early hours. Many leaders had already left the room, but you stayed until a solution was found, together with me and a few others. I was there as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. We managed to find a way to keep Greece inside the euro area, and you played a crucial role in getting us there. The consequences of Greece exiting would have been much greater than any risks posed by another rescue package. It was the right decision, as we now know, even if some at the time were not convinced or had their doubts.
Your keen interest in understanding complex issues, often completely immersing yourself in the matter in question, helped you during those intense meetings. I remember one occasion when you pored over the IMF’s model assumptions about Greece’s debt sustainability. Thankfully our calculations broadly survived your scrutiny, but you made sure to question and fully understand them. It was rare to see this kind of attention to detail from someone in your position. It impressed me.
But it was no coincidence that you were always the best preparedperson inthe room. You were the best in class at school, and that work ethic never left you. Yet knowing your brief inside out had another benefit for you: it meant that you didn’t have to rely on others. You could take matters into your own hands – and deliver the outcomes that no one else could.
The moral force
Your pragmatism, however, never drifted into opportunism. The clarity of your moral compass made sure of that. And this is the third attribute, Angela, that stands out: your moral force.
You served four terms as Chancellor, a total of 16 years. Everything you did during those 5,860 days as Chancellor was grounded in your values. Your moral compass guided you even at times when there was not – yet – a majority in favour of your decisions. Your fixed points were freedom and democracy, the good of the German people and the strength of the European Union. There was no place for hyperbolic ideologies.
Your experience growing up in a dictatorship, surrounded by a wall, also meant that you did not turn a blind eye to the suffering and hardship of others. This was on display most clearly when we saw hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the summer of 2015. Others built fences and closed their borders, but you kept your country’s borders open. You welcomed those who were looking for refuge.
Though you earned a lot of praise around the world for that decision, you were harshly criticised at home. But you did not waver. You stood by your decision – because it was the right thing to do.
As the Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll – who was born here in Cologne – wrote: “Freedom is not a gift, it is something that is earned.” Your actions gave those people a chance to find freedom where you had found it so many years before.
You were often underestimated because you were a woman or because you came from East Germany. You were often the outsider who nobody could quite place. But instead of being upset or angry about this, you used it to your advantage – against your opponents, and in favour of the many millions who have benefited from your compassion and conviction.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
As Germany’s first female Chancellor, you steered your country and Europe through a series of crises: the great financial crisis, the European debt crisis, the refugee crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. And especially after the pandemic, amid a global trend towards fragmentation, it has become clear that we need Europe more than ever to pool our strengths and to make up for our weaknesses.
You were the antidote to the emerging populist movements that feed on fake news and false narratives, polarising our societies. You stood for unity while others sowed division.
Throughout your career you were driven by a deep respect for the precious gifts of democracy and freedom. In keeping with that, you stepped down voluntarily when you felt that it was time to move on.
The people of Germany and Europe can be proud to have had such a principled leader, who worked day and night to preserve their prosperity with patience, pragmatism, and persistence.
Dear Angela, you were an exceptional leader in exceptional times.
Congratulations."

Speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, State of the Union conference organised by the European University Institute
Florence, 5 May 2023
Many thanks for inviting me to address this conference along with so many esteemed speakers. As the cradle of the Renaissance, Florence has a long history of attracting people from different disciplines across Europe. The most gifted individuals in the fields of art, science, politics and finance have long come to this city to make a difference, together unleashing creative forces of a magnitude greater than the sum of their already impressive individual contributions. Just as we have come to Palazzo Vecchio today to unlock the creativity required to address the multidimensional challenges that are affecting the state of the European Union. My contribution will focus on the most pressing challenge requiring urgent action: the ongoing climate and environmental crises.
The problem is clear. The state of the EU is not yet on a transition path that is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement – to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and in any case well below 2 degrees. Linear trend extrapolation of global warming puts us going beyond 1.5 degrees in March 2035.[1]Mind you, when country delegates negotiated the Paris Agreement in December 2015, the trend suggested this level would not be breached until March 2045. In other words, on top of the seven-plus years that have passed since the Paris Agreement, we have lost another ten.
Using a more sophisticated approach, the Climate Action Tracker – which was developed by a consortium of climate research organisations – when compiled in November 2022 assessed that the policies and actions taken by the EU were almost sufficient to be consistent with limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. The picture improves if the tracker incorporates policy commitments made but not yet implemented. However, even then it is still not consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. For some existing commitments, the European Council recently endorsed several measures proposed by the European Commission. Nonetheless, more specific commitments are clearly required and all promises need to be kept.
Importantly, under its Fit-for-55 strategy, the EU is committed to lowering carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Moreover, against the backdrop of Russia’s horrific ongoing war against Ukraine, the EU has pledged to become independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030 under its REPowerEU plan.
The European Commission estimates that reaching the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU objectives requires an average annual investment of €1.25 trillion over the years 2021-30.[2]That estimate would add around €500 billion to the level of annual investment in climate and energy security seen in the previous decade.[3]Most of this additional investment will need to come from the private sector as households and firms adjust to a net-zero economy. However, significant shortcomings in the functioning of the financial system are presently curtailing the flow of investment in green – and therefore truly sustainable – economic development.
Gaps in finance
Most prominently, carbon pricing is still not being used to an adequate extent. Progress has been made: the carbon price in the EU’s emission trading system has been rising since 2021, and the European Council and European Parliament recently agreed on extending the scheme’s scope of application and on a mechanism to equalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports.[4]However, overall emissions continue to be improperly priced, implying that economic activity – including the flow of finance – remains biased in favour of high-emission activities.
Besides the gap in carbon pricing, a second gap is that capital markets are not playing their potential role in supporting the green transition. ECB research shows that stock markets can strongly encourage investment in greener technologies.[5]However, those markets are still relatively underdeveloped in the EU and a lack of harmonisation limits cross-border flows. Resolving these issues and advancing a capital markets union, as proposed by the European Commission, will boost the efficiency and resilience of the flow of finance in Europe. As ECB President Christine Lagarde has said when speaking about the green transition, developing the capital markets union is “too good an opportunity to pass up”.[6]Today I add: we must seize this opportunity.
A third gap can be identified in the approach banks are taking to climate-related and environmental risks in their activities. In recent years, the ECB has conducted several benchmarking exercises among banks under our supervision to assess their practices against our expectations for a sound management of climate-related and environmental risks. These exercises showed that while almost all banks acknowledge the importance of climate-related and environmental risks and while we are seeing progress, banks’ practices to manage these risks are still underdeveloped and insufficiently applied across the board. Given these shortcomings, at present it is difficult to see how banks can sufficiently help their customers navigate the transition and become resilient to climate change and environmental degradation in a timely manner.
While most financing for the green transition should come from private resources, the public sector also has an important role to play, both directly through public investment and indirectly though co-financing, private-public partnerships or State guarantees.[7]Much of this will be financed at the European level through the EU Member States’ national recovery and resilience plans as part of the Next Generation EU programme that was set up to support the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. How much these EU-financed expenditures will contribute to the EU’s climate objectives is uncertain and depends on how successfully and quickly the individual countries implement their recovery and resilience plans. Earlier this year, the European Commission proposed a Green Deal Industrial Plan intended to support this effort.
Analysis by ECB staff shows that, from a legal and institutional perspective, public investment efforts could well be supplemented by additional EU-financed resources in the form of a European Climate and Energy Security Fund.[8]As in the case of Next Generation EU in response to the pandemic, there are compelling arguments to suggest that the investment efforts required to support an orderly transition are exceptional, one-off and temporary. At the same time, concerns have recently emerged about Member States’ capacity to implement their existing recovery and resilience plans.[9]These concerns can largely be traced back to administrative hurdles at the national and local level and need to be addressed before any additional resources are considered. Moreover, any additional European funds would need to be accompanied by a euro area aggregate fiscal stance that is consistent with the ECB’s fight against high inflation.
Besides gaps that curtail the transition, there are also gaps in the financial system that are threatening its resilience to increased climate-related and environmental damages. A recent discussion paper by the ECB and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority shows that only around 25% of all climate-related catastrophe losses in the European Union are currently insured.[10]In some countries, including Italy, the figure is below 5%. As natural disasters become both more frequent and more severe, insurance costs are expected to rise. Some insurers may reduce risk coverage or stop providing certain types of catastrophe insurance altogether, which would widen the insurance gap further.
The lack of climate catastrophe insurance can affect the economy and financial stability.[11]If losses are not covered by insurance, households and firms will take more time to resume their activities, slowing economic recovery. Banks’ exposure to credit risk may therefore increase. The fiscal position of governments may be also weakened if they need to provide relief to cover uninsured losses.
All this confirms that, when preparing for the future, we must acknowledge that the world – and therefore the economy – will change. Regardless of whether the gaps that I have described are closed or not, the economy will face profound changes and increasing shocks. Moreover, analyses consistently show that if we fail to deliver on a timely and orderly transition, the macro-financial damage will be more severe than if we act in time. We are in a race against the clock, and so far the clock is winning.
Implications for the ECB
The ECB takes the consequences of the ongoing climate and environmental crises into account in the pursuit of its mandate. We are mindful that if we ignore these consequences we cannot deliver on our objectives of maintaining price stability and preserving the safety and soundness of the banking system. In fact, we are committed to aligning ourselves with a Paris-compatible transition path across all our tasks and responsibilities because this is a precondition for sustainably fulfilling all our tasks and responsibilities.
Let me give two specific examples of actions we are taking within our mandate that show our focus on some of the gaps that I have mentioned.
On the monetary policy side, in an effort to correct for the bias that exists in financial markets in favour of high-emission activities, since October 2022 we have been tilting our corporate bond purchases towards those issuers with a better climate performance.[12]Similarly, we will incorporate climate-related considerations when assessing the collateral that banks can pledge when borrowing from us.
In banking supervision, we have been persistently pushing the banks we supervise to close the gap between their practices and our expectations on the sound management of climate-related and environmental risks. Banks’ practices must be fully aligned with our expectations by the end of 2024 at the latest and we have set interim deadlines for banks to satisfy specific requirements even earlier. If necessary, we will enforce these deadlines, standing ready to use all the supervisory instruments at our disposal. Let me be clear: as Vice-Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board, it is not for me to determine whom banks should lend to. Instead, what I and other banking supervisors around the world have consistently been emphasising is that a failure to adequately manage climate-related and environmental risks is no longer compatible with sound risk management. To manage their own risks, banks need to engage with their customers to gain a deep understanding of how they are being affected by the climate and environmental crises and how they will mitigate and adapt to the consequences.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Leonardo da Vinci – a resident of Florence when finance first thrived back in the early days of the Renaissance – is believed to have said that “nature never breaks her own laws”. Indeed, nature’s laws are a constraint on human activities that we cannot set aside. After all, we are an integral part of nature. We have been pushing the boundaries of this constraint for far too long and the devastating consequences are now increasingly upon us.
Yet we do have the power to bend this trend we ourselves set in motion. This requires us to be mindful of the gaps that perpetuate the destructive trend and to work relentlessly towards closing them. Only then can we change nature’s current course and ensure a Paris-aligned transition path. Each and every one of us must act in our areas of competence and responsibility. Respecting nature’s laws. Conscious of her precariousness, preserving her preciousness.
Thank you for your attention."

Introductory statement by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 24 April 2023
I am pleased to appear before this Committee again today as part of our series of hearings on the digital euro project.
We are now entering the final stage of the investigation phase of the project. The ECB’s Governing Council recently endorsed a third set of design options for the digital euro – design options that we have also discussed in previous hearings. Today we are thus publishing a report setting out the Eurosystem’s views on how people could access, hold and start to use the digital euro. The report also examines how the digital euro could be distributed by intermediaries as well as the services and features it could offer.[1]
Our work in recent months has not just been about investigating technical issues. We have also held focus groups to hear from potential users of a digital euro and find out what they think about the different features a digital wallet should have. This will help us in designing a product that meets their needs.[2]
In a modern economy, being able to pay digitally is a basic need for people.
With cash, central banks already provide a means of payment that is risk-free, widely accessible and easy to use, and that leaves no-one behind. But the rapid digitalisation of our economies requires us to complement cash with its evolution in the digital sphere: a digital euro.
As a central bank, we need to be ready for future evolutions and make sure that the money we issue maintains its role as a monetary anchor in the digital era, thereby reassuring us that one euro is one euro whatever form it takes and wherever we go. And it cements people’s trust in our currency.[3]
For this monetary anchor to be effective, the digital euro would need to be in line with people’s preferences. Everyone across the euro area should be able to use it for day-to-day payments: online, in shops or from person to person.
In my remarks today, I will focus on how we can ensure that everyone in the euro area would be able to easily access and use a digital euro – if and when they want to, no matter who they bank with or which country they come from. People would have noobligationto use the digital euro. But they should always have theoptionto use it. Just like they do with cash today.
You, as European legislators, will take decisions that will be key to us achieving this objective. Therefore, in my remarks I will look at the digital euro also from a regulatory angle.
There is currently no single European digital means of payment that is universally accepted across the entire euro area. It therefore comes as no surprise that Europeans see the ability topay anywhereas the most important feature of a potential digital euro.[4]In other words, they are keen for one of the key characteristics of euro banknotes to be replicated in the digital realm.
At the ECB, we have been investigating the technical solutions that would enable people to easily make payments in digital euro, anywhere in the euro area.[5]But if we want the digital euro to replicate these cash-like features, we need a proper regulatory framework.
Legislators assigned the legal tender status to euro banknotes in the Treaty[6], and this is why citizens can use them throughout the entire euro area.[7]They are tangible proof that we share a single currency.
The digital euro could also be given legal tender status by legislators.[8]If introduced, the digital euro would be a public good, and Europeans would expect to be able to access and use it easily, anywhere in the euro area. So, it would be more beneficial and convenient for all users if merchants that accept digital payments were obliged to accept the digital euro as legal tender.[9]
A requirement for merchants to accept digital euro could, in fact, also be seen as an opportunity. For example, it would make European payments more resilient and would enhance competition.[10]This, in turn, would help to make payments cheaper, with clear benefits for everyone in the euro area.[11]
But if we want to make the digital euro widely usable, acceptance is only one side of the coin. The other side is access.
Individuals and merchants will expect to be able to obtain digital euro at their banks[12], just like they do today with cash.[13]It should be simple for people to start using the digital euro, and there should be no need to change bank in order to do so.
In our regular exchanges, consumer associations and merchants[14]have remarked that the best way to ensure broad access for consumers would be to require euro area banks and other payment service providers to make the digital euro available to their customers.[15]Previous attempts at building pan-European payment initiatives have shown that ensuring broad access throughout the euro area has ultimately always required regulatory measures.[16]
So, both sides of the coin – widespread acceptance and broad access – are necessary to ensuring the digital euro would be a public good that meets the expectations of consumers and merchants.
These two aspects are also key to achieve other public policy goals. For instance, they are essential to ensure that the digital euro can support financial inclusion and generate opportunities for financial intermediaries.
A digital euro would offer a new platform for innovation that is truly European. It would allow these intermediaries to build services for their customers that are instantly available across Europe. It could help domestic payment providers and new instant payment solutions to scale up and operate at the European level. And it would reduce dependence on a few dominant providers, increasing competition and resilience.
Over the past 20 years euro banknotes have enabled everyone in the euro area to easily recognise and use public money, regardless of what country they are living in, or where they are paying.
The same should be true for the digital euro. People should be able to pay and be paid in digital euro anywhere in the euro area, no matter which intermediary they are using to access the digital euro or which country they are in.
To achieve this, we need a common set of standards – which we call a “payment scheme”.[17]
The scope of these standards will be limited to what is strictly necessary to establish and offer users a harmonised and convenient payment experience, while enabling and inviting the supervised intermediaries to develop further services and solutions.[18]
Even if supervised intermediaries will distribute the digital euro, one should not forget that it will be a liability of the central bank. The Eurosystem, as its issuer, would be accountable to euro area citizens for its correspondence to their payment needs. The Eurosystem should therefore be able to govern the standards to ensure that using a digital euro in the future is as standardised as using cash today. It would do so by steering consensus among all involved stakeholders – consumers, retailers, banks and non-banks.
Economic incentives should be used to encourage the active distribution of the digital euro and to ensure that it is widely available. We have already proposed a set of four core principles for a digital euro compensation model.[19]
You asked for more details on these principles in previous hearings, so I will share our thoughts on them now. Ultimately, however, the decision on the regulatory framework for fees is primarily a matter for you, as European legislators.
The first principle is that, as a public good, the digital euro should serve society. We believe consumers should be able to use it free of charge for basic day-to-day purposes.[20]
Second, intermediaries should be compensated for the services they provide, just like they are for other digital payments.
Third, legislative safeguards should prevent merchants from being overcharged by intermediaries if they are obliged to accept digital euro as legal tender. While we believe that the digital euro would allow for more competitive fees, this principle would ensure that fees for merchants cannot exceed the current levels for comparable means of payment.
Finally, the Eurosystem would bear its own costs, for example for settlement[21]activities and managing the common standards for making and receiving payments in digital euro. This would reflect the public good nature of the digital euro and follow the same logic that currently applies to cash. The savings that arise from the Eurosystem covering its own costs would ultimately benefit the end-users.
Let me conclude.
The design of the digital euro and its regulatory framework are key to ensuring that it retains its key characteristics as a public good.
It will then be European legislators to decide whether the digital euro will be an inclusive, truly European means of payment – widely usable and accessible across the entire euro area, free for basic use, and offering the highest levels of privacy. The success of a digital euro will be in your hands.
The ECB stands ready to continue discussing all these issues with you during the legislative process. Throughout the next project phase, which is expected to be launched later this year, we will accommodate any necessary adjustments to the design of the digital euro that may emerge from legislative deliberations.[22]In that phase, we will develop and test the possible technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro.
These two processes – legislative and design – should advance in parallel so we can be in a position to promptly begin issuing a digital euro, if and when warranted. The possible decision by the Governing Council to issue a digital euro would be taken only after the legislative act has been adopted.
We will take all the necessary measures to ensure that the digital euro would act as a true public good. But all European institutions have to play their part to achieve our common goal of making the digital euro a success. This is why we are looking forward to the European Commission’s legislative proposal. It will be a decisive step forward for the digital euro and put Europe at the forefront of the work on central bank digital currencies among the G7.
I now look forward to your questions."
147,2023-04-24,Fabio Panetta,United we stand: European integration as a response to global fragmentation,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230424~67a4af298c.en.html,"United we stand: European integration as a response to global fragmentation
Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an event on “Integration, multilateralism and sovereignty: building a Europe fit for new global dynamics” organised by Bruegel
Brussels, 24 April 2023
Recent developments have raised the question of how geopolitics will affect global economic relations in the 21st century.[1]
History suggests that the world is facing a trilemma, whereby peace, open trade and antagonistic political competition struggle to coexist. Open trade and peace can only be sustained if a stable political, economic and legal international order supported by common institutions offers a non-conflictual and enforceable way of dealing with disagreements.
This lesson was the basis for the creation of multilateral international institutions and European integration after the Second World War. They supported trade integration and facilitated access to capital, labour, natural resources and technology.
But in recent years severe geopolitical tensions have emerged, posing a threat to both peace and trade, and in turn to prosperity. These tensions increase the risks of multiple supply shocks destabilising prices and the economy, making it more difficult for central banks to deliver on their mandates.[2]
In this context, technology is taking on a crucial role. It remains a key driver of trade, notably in services. It offers an antidote to the effects of a possible reversal of globalisation by making it possible to use scarcer resources more effectively and reduce dependencies. And it supports growth by generating productivity gains. But it may exacerbate political competition as major powers strive for technological dominance.
Today, I will argue that closer European integration is the best response to global fragmentation. It provides us with the necessary foundation and scale to bolster our resilience to this fragmentation and our influence on international developments.
I will start by discussing the link between globalisation and the EU’s economic model. I will then turn to economic fragmentation and the changing nature of globalisation, emphasising the implications for the economy and monetary policy in Europe. And I will consider how the EU can pursue openness while preparing for fragmentation scenarios.
Globalisation and the EU’s economic model
In the aftermath of the Second World War, global trade integration underpinned by multilateral institutions aimed to reduce the risk of conflict. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)[3], signed in 1948, sought to liberalise trade and correct the protectionist measures that had been in place since the 1930s. In 1995 the World Trade Organization (WTO) replaced the GATT, providing the world economy with a negotiation forum where countries could address trade issues under the aegis of an agreed system of rules and a mechanism for solving trade disputes peacefully.[4]
Around the turn of the century, we entered a phase of globalisation “on steroids”[5]marked by a considerable increase in trade (Chart 1) and the integration of India and China into the world economy.
This globalisation boom has had positive effects for the global economy overall,[6]as the reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers[7]fostered trade, job creation, innovation and growth.The increasing participation in international trade has allowed emerging market economies to reduce the technology gap, improve institutional capacity and promote the accumulation of physical and human capital.
The EU has been a major contributor to the open trade system, achieving high levels of economic integration with the rest of the world. Trade flows between the euro area and the rest of the world reached 54% of euro area output in 2021, compared with 26% in the case of the United States. Regional and global integration has given the euro area an advantage over other advanced economies: by enhancing country specialisation and input sourcing possibilities, it has supported competitiveness and export market shares.[8]
But the EU’s reliance on exports was not complemented by adequate domestic investment and home-grown innovation. And the current circumstances highlight the significant risks of relying excessively on foreign demand as a growth engine. It can distract from the need to invest domestically and to improve competitiveness. And it can obscure the fact that dependencies on trade linkages can turn into vulnerabilities, allowing foreign players to weaponise them. Therefore, the EU needs to rely more on domestic demand – like other large, advanced economies – and reduce its dependencies.
Indeed, the euro area growth model largely relied on the assumption that an open multilateral economic order would continue to prevail in the future, guaranteeing continued access to relatively cheap imported resources, critical raw materials and technology. Investing in openness was often seen as a substitute for domestic investment in our physical, human and social capital.
It is now clear that these favourable conditions can no longer be taken for granted. We therefore need to rebalance the EU’s economic model.
Challenges for the European economy
The principle of multilateral cooperation – which most countries had until recently adhered to – is now facing formidable challenges, which are leading to fragmentation in international trade and finance.
The shocks that have hit the world economy have exposed the flip side to economic interdependence, which is vulnerability. Geopolitical risks have triggered a flight to safety, and many countries are putting an emphasis on greater autonomy.
While this is not a new trend, it is a fact that protectionist tendencies – which had already increased in 2017-18 with the trade dispute between the United States and China – increased further after the COVID-19 pandemic (Chart 2). And they have intensified further still following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The EU – for decades a champion of openness and integration – has developed its Open Strategic Autonomy agenda in order to prevent dependencies becoming vulnerabilities.[9]
Geopolitical tensions and global fragmentation could entail high economic costs. Simulations by Eurosystem staff show that a fragmentation of the world economy would lead to sizeable losses in both global trade and welfare.[10]The EU thus needs to continue working towards safeguarding trade openness while increasing its own resilience to fragmentation.
So far, the levelling-off of global trade in goods since the great financial crisis can be characterised as a phase of “slowbalisation” rather than “deglobalisation”.[11]In the services sector, the growth of international trade seems to be signalling a continuation of globalisation trends driven by technological progress.[12]Overall, aggregate data do not point towards deglobalisation, at least not for now.
At the same time, the nature of globalisation may be changing. Firms are becoming more inclined towards nearshoring, onshoring or friend-shoring their supply chains, especially for the production of advanced technologies (Chart 3).[13]
Moreover, foreign direct investment in strategic sectors is becoming more fragmented, primarily to the detriment of Asian countries.[14]For instance, large US chip companies are showing a long-term commitment to moving their manufacturing plants back to the United States, also in response to the US CHIPS and Science Act.[15]These pledges mark a significant shift in the ability of US industry to manufacture semiconductors after two decades of dependence on offshore production.[16]
This new state of affairs poses challenges for the EU economy and the ECB’s monetary policy. Weaker trade integration could significantly reduce welfare because our economy is one of the most open and outward-oriented large economies. Its interdependencies could therefore turn into vulnerabilities (Chart 4).
Fragmentation may also affect the ECB’s monetary policy. Geopolitical shocks may trigger persistent output and inflation volatility, with multiple spillovers.[17]Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has, for instance, disrupted energy and commodities markets, with major implications for inflation.
Moreover, the evolving nature of globalisation could influence the natural rate of interest. Efforts to diversify imports and reduce foreign dependencies on specific countries may reduce productivity and curb the demand for safe assets coming from these countries, pushing up global interest rates. Capital movements and financing conditions could also be affected. At the same time, changes in international labour supply may affect the composition and dynamics of domestic labour markets, causing mismatches, changes in wage-setting relations and wage rises in the longer run.
Dealing with fragmentation
In this environment, the challenge is to pursue openness while preparing for fragmentation scenarios.
The way forward should include at least the following elements.
On the external front, the EU should continue to defend the principle of multilateralism, resisting the formation of closed blocs. A trade confrontation would lead to significant losses (Chart 5). We should not shy away from pursuing a more assertive role in fostering global cooperation. We should leverage our large internal market and significant share of global trade[18], while at the same time strengthening cooperation beyond close partners.
The EU should also diversify its participation in supply chains. The role that low-income countries can play in the EU’s supply chains should be considered further. Successful partnerships, including with low-income countries, could reduce the risk of value chains fragmenting along geopolitical blocs, especially in areas such as the green transition, where cooperation is vital and critical raw materials play an essential role.
The EU also needs to revisit its growth model, balancing external orientation with home-grown demand. The reasons are threefold. First, to remedy insufficient public investment and structural reforms, for which we should leverage European tools and objectives, as we did for the Next Generation EU. Second, to raise total factor productivity, which requires increasing investment in domestic research and cutting-edge civil and defence technologies. And third, to leverage the complementarity of Member States’ economies, using comparative advantages within the Single Market to reinforce European value chains, foster competitiveness and boost resilience to geopolitical shocks. This would also increase European cohesion and internal convergence.
European integration will also strengthen our ability to influence international developments. Well-coordinated, common EU action can be more effective at global level than isolated moves, especially when facing players of considerable economic and political weight.
Initiatives to deepen Economic and Monetary Union and strengthen the integration of the Single Market would also make our economy more resilient and stable, especially if backed by an appropriate common fiscal capacity. Such a fiscal capacity would support the necessary investment in EU public goods in areas such as the green transition, digital innovation and military spending.[19]
Policies aimed at increasing our strategic autonomy need to be carefully coordinated to ensure that they do not lead to internal fragmentation themselves. The EU’s strategic autonomy framework should avoid a counterproductive reliance on national solutions to global shocks, as this could bring about an internal race for subsidies, inefficient allocation of resources or unfair competition among EU Member States, exacerbating domestic economic divergences to the advantage of Member States with more fiscal space (Chart 6). The European Commission’s new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework – which fosters public investment support in sectors which are key for the transition towards a net-zero economy – acknowledges this risk and includes several safeguards. Importantly, aid cannot trigger relocation of investments between Member States.[20]Undue protectionist policies that give a competitive edge to domestic industries may trigger beggar-thy-neighbour effects that undermine trust and openness.
Conclusion
There are no easy answers to geopolitical challenges that endanger peace, trade and prosperity, especially when the decisions steering geopolitics are beyond, or largely beyond, the control of domestic policymakers. Yet some of these decisions have severe consequences for the economies and policies of all countries. This was why in the aftermath of the Second World War a new global order was created – based on multilateral institutions – to buttress world trade.
But the current and future shape of the European Union and euro area is in the hands of Europeans. Closer European integration is the best response to global fragmentation. It gives us a stronger voice on the international stage to promote cooperation and openness. It provides the necessary scale to invest in technology and capitalise on domestic resources. And it is the right level on which to foster an open strategic autonomy that builds on the Single Market, rather than undermining it."

Speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Peterson Institute for International Economics
Washington DC, 21 April 2023
Central banks and supervisors are not climate and environmental policymakers.
Central banks and supervisors are climate and environmental policy takers.
There are a lot of climate-related and environmental factors to take into account to deliver on the mandated objectives of central banks and banking supervisors.
This is not a message that is just coming from me. It is, in fact, the global consensus among central banks and supervisors as established through the Network for Greening the Financial System, which has 121 members worldwide, including six authorities in the United States.[1]It is acknowledged in the work programmes of global standard-setting bodies such as the International Sustainability Standards Board, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. And it is reflected in the actions taken by central banks and supervisors in the pursuit of their mandates.
Today, I will explain why central banks and supervisors taking climate-related and environmental considerations into account should not be seen as controversial. I will outline how the actions that central banks and supervisors take to account for climate-related and environmental factors follow from their democratically assigned mandates. I will show how these actions build on the awareness that the economy will be subject to increased shocks from ongoing climate and environmental crises while undergoing one of the biggest structural transformations in modern history. And I will show that these developments without any doubt will have a material impact on the financial sector too.
The many examples of climate-related and environmental risks
When talking about this topic last month, US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen was very clear when she said that such impacts are no longer hypothetical.[2]There are many examples on both sides of the Atlantic: intensifying storms along the coasts of the United States; severe floods and droughts across continental Europe; and wildfires in California Florida, Italy and Spain. Both extreme rainfall and extreme droughts are on the rise in the places where we live and work because they are on the rise all across the globe. It is estimated that in the United States the five-year average annual cost of billion-dollar climate-related disasters, including 2022, is now USD 119 billion, which is triple the long-term average.[3]
At the same time, governments are taking action to mitigate and adapt to the consequences of ongoing climate and environmental crises. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act contains unprecedented measures aimed at supporting the green transition. Similarly, in the EU a multitude of policy, regulatory and legislative measures – including the European Climate Law[4]– are being implemented to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% compared with 1990 levels by 2030 and to ensure climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. Measures at the EU level are being complemented by action in individual Member States, while action is also being taken at individual state level in the United States.
Not only public authorities and non-governmental organisations acknowledge these physical and transition risks of the climate and environmental crises for the financial sector. Banks themselves are also telling us that they see these risks as material to their risk profiles in the near term. Put simply, climate-related and environmental risks cannot be ignored and, fortunately, they are no longer being ignored. On the contrary, they are being taken very seriously.
Preserving the soundness of banks
Let me now turn to how climate-related and environmental factors are increasingly being taken into account in banking supervision. It is worth recalling the guiding principle for prudential regulators and supervisors around the globe: that no material risks should be left unaddressed. This polestar of banking supervision is enshrined in the core principles of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and has been included in legal requirements for decades. According to this simple but crucial principle, banks must identify and adequately manage the risks they are exposed to. This also holds true for climate-related and environmental risks. To be clear, it is not for supervisors to tell banks how green their lending policies must be. Supervisors are not pickers of winners and losers in the green transition. However, the international community of banking supervisors does insist that ignoring the ongoing climate and environment crises as well as the transition towards a more sustainable economy is no longer compatible with sound risk management.
At the ECB we published our guide with supervisory expectations for banks’ risk management practices of climate-related and environmental risks in 2020.[5]In the two years that followed, we conducted a number of supervisory exercises focusing on banks’ approaches to managing these risks. We looked closely at how banks are performing relative to our expectations and found that they still have a long way to go before they are fully compliant. For example, most banks have put in place organisational architecture to address climate-related risks in line with our expectations. However, banks’ approaches still lack sophistication and granular information that are required for active management of the risk profile of institutions.[6]Based on our dialogue with banks, we think it is reasonable to expect the gap between their current practices and full compliance with all our expectations to be closed by 2024 at the latest. Consequently, we have announced that we will hold the banks to this date, including a number of interim milestones. If necessary, we will enforce these timelines.
In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board proposed substantively similar guidance for large banks under their jurisdiction. This year, the Federal Reserve Board will complement this guidance with an exercise focusing on banks’ resilience to a set of different scenarios for the climate crisis. Supervisory authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are taking action to ensure that climate risks are appropriately assessed and accounted for by banks in their risk management practices.
However, this is not just a transatlantic trend. Thanks to the BCBS’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks, which I co-chair with Kevin Stiroh of the US Federal Reserve, concrete steps have been taken to merge existing international practices into an initial formal consensus at a global level. As a result, there is progress on all three pillars of the Basel Framework for the global prudential regulation of banks.
For instance, as a first step on Pillar 1, the BCBS has recently published a set of frequently asked questions to clarify how climate-related financial risks may be captured in the existing Pillar 1 framework. The BCBS’s guidance tells banks how they can already consider material climate-related risks in their regulatory capital, for example, when determining the value of real estate.
Moreover, in June 2022 the BCBS published the Pillar 2 principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks, making clear its expectation that they should be implemented as soon as possible. To ensure this, the BCBS included the monitoring of progress across jurisdictions as a key element in its 2023-24 work programme.
In the field of disclosures, I am similarly pleased to see various international initiatives brought together at the Basel level. Building on the extensive work that had already been done in various fora, the BCBS started developing high-quality and globally consistent Pillar 3 climate-related disclosure requirements. The BCBS will issue a consultation paper on the proposed framework before the end of this year.
All of these steps foster transparency, ensure an international level playing field and maintain the risk-based orientation of the Basel Framework. I welcome in particular the fact that we are making progress across all key elements of the Basel Framework. Such a holistic approach is the only way to make sure that climate-related and environmental risks are managed competently, consistently and comprehensively – which is just how regulators, supervisors and banks are used to handling any other material risk. Only then can banks preserve the solidity of their balance sheets and continue to serve their stakeholders irrespective of the macro-financial challenges that may emerge.
Preserving price stability
Let me now move on to monetary policy.
Obviously, central banks can only pursue price stability if they can understand, assess and forecast how economic shocks and trends affect inflation and the effectiveness of monetary policy. So, apart from its scope and potential severity, accounting for the climate and environmental crises is no different than accounting for globalisation, demographics or financial innovation. Central banks must adapt their data and economic modelling to be able to assess the monetary policy implications of climate change and environmental degradation, including transition policies.[7]Moreover, central banks must take into account their exposures to climate-related and environmental risks when designing monetary policy instruments and considering the composition of their balance sheets.
We know that the preservation of price stability sometimes requires a central bank to take risks onto its balance sheet. For example, when engaging in quantitative easing, central banks absorbed duration risk by purchasing long-term bonds from the private sector. They did so not because they had identified a lucrative investment strategy. In fact, central banks were very much aware at the time that their profitability would be impacted if interest rates were to rise in the future. Instead, the absorption of duration risk was crucial to providing monetary policy accommodation beyond what could be achieved by lowering policy rates to support inflation that was – at that time – too low for too long.
To enable central banks to continue to effectively use their balance sheets in the pursuit of their mandate in the future, it is important that the soundness of their balance sheets is preserved. This means that central banks must be very conscious of the risks that they need to take to preserve price stability. At the same time, central banks must be equally conscious of the need to steer clear of risks that do not contribute to – or may even be detrimental to – price stability.
I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that misalignment between a central bank’s balance sheet and a transition path compatible with the Paris Agreement might be helpful to securing price stability. On the contrary, available evidence points in the opposite direction. Aligning ourselves with a status quo biased against Paris-compatibility risks adding to macroeconomic volatility which would complicate the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of price stability down the road.
As a result, central banks taking climate-related and environmental financial risks into account supports price stability in two ways. First, it contributes to preserving the soundness of central banks’ balance sheets. Second, it reduces bias towards emission-intensive activities that can fuel macroeconomic volatility in the longer term.
In the case of the ECB, in addition to contributing to our primary objective of price stability, our climate and environmental actions also serve our secondary objective. This secondary objective – just like our primary objective laid down in the EU Treaties – tells us that we shall support the general economic policies of the EU; without prejudice to price stability. To put this in less legalistic and more pragmatic terms: whenever we have a choice between two instruments – or calibrations of instruments – that are equally conducive to price stability, we choose the one that is most supportive of the EU’s general economic policies, including the climate neutrality objective.
Let me give you a very specific example of how we at the ECB put all of this into practice. In October 2022 we started tilting our reinvestments of corporate bonds towards issuers with a better climate performance. You may also be aware that since March we have been reinvesting only a part of the maturing bonds to ensure the consistency of our monetary policy portfolios with the overall monetary policy stance. To maintain a decarbonisation path for our corporate asset holdings that is compatible with the Paris Agreement, we decided to increase the degree of our tilt towards issuers with a better climate performance during partial reinvestment. This serves to avoid undue exposures to climate-related risks that are detrimental to price stability and to align the way we administer our monetary policy more closely with the general economic policies of the EU.
Very similar reasoning could be applied to our public sector bond holdings, which account for most of our monetary policy assets. At the moment, the bulk of our public sector bond holdings consists of bonds issued by governments of EU Member States. However, the climate and environmental risk intensity of these different bonds is not obvious in the absence of a clear and reliable framework to assess their compatibility with the Paris Agreement. At the same time, since the pandemic, the universe of supranational bonds issued by EU institutions has increased significantly, with a relatively large proportion of green bonds.[8]When there is no clear monetary policy rationale for preferring domestic sovereign bonds, in my view we could consider increasing the share of EU supranational bonds in our total bond holdings to avoid potential climate and environmental risks and better align our balance sheet with the general economic policies of the EU.
Our commitment to avoid climate-related risks that are detrimental to price stability and to align with the general economic policies of the EU is part of our monetary policy strategy. Therefore, it applies to everything that we do. Beyond our bond holdings this includes our collateral framework. To support our efforts to align with a Paris-compatible transition path, we have recently started disclosing our exposures to climate-related financial risk.[9]We will regularly review our measures to ensure that they are fit for purpose and aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate neutrality objectives.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
If the macro-financial developments of the past year have taught us anything, it is to remember the importance of having dedicated institutions responsible for maintaining price stability and the soundness of our financial system. As central bankers and supervisors, this is our job.
We are not climate and environmental policymakers.
We are climate and environmental policy takers.
We need to take climate and environmental factors into account if we want to deliver on the important supervisory and monetary policy mandates that we have been given. By failing to do so, we would be failing in our mandates. And believe me, we won’t.
Thank you for your attention."

Keynote address by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Enterprise Ireland Summit 2023
Dublin, 19 April 2023
Introduction
I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this event, which marks 25 years of Enterprise Ireland.[1]The ECB also turns 25 this year, as operations began in June 1998 ahead of the launch of the euro on 1 January 1999.
My aim today is to review the impact of rising interest rates on the financing of firms. It is strongly in the interests of the enterprise sector that inflation is low and stable over the medium term, since high and volatile inflation disrupts business operations by making it more difficult to execute basic tasks, including the setting of prices, the management of costs and the development of medium-term financial and operational plans. In response to the extraordinary surge in inflation since 2021, the ECB has been raising interest rates in order to make sure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. During this tightening cycle, firms must not only grapple with the inflation shock but also with the impact of the upward shift in interest rates that is necessary to make sure that inflation quickly subsides.
Higher interest rates affect firms through multiple channels. At a macroeconomic level, tighter monetary policy dampens consumption and investment, reducing demand for consumer and business products. All else equal, it also causes a currency to appreciate, posing challenges for exporters. My focus today is on the impact of tighter monetary policy on the financing conditions facing firms.
The economic outlook
To set the scene, I will first briefly review the economic outlook. The extraordinary adverse supply shocks associated with pandemic shutdowns, supply bottlenecks and the energy crisis are steadily reversing, providing the basis for a more optimistic outlook for the euro area economy compared to expectations last autumn. In particular, lower global energy prices and the easing of supply bottlenecks are boosting confidence and supporting incomes and business activity, while also reducing price pressures. Rising wages provide further support for demand.
The ECB staff macroeconomic projections of March 2023 see economic activity rebounding over the course of the year, with growth expected to average one per cent in 2023, marking a significant upward revision to the near-term path for GDP compared to the December 2022 projections (Chart 1). At the same time, the continued tightening of financial conditions, the appreciation of the euro and the gradual withdrawal of fiscal support will weigh on aggregate demand over the medium term, with output now set to expand less rapidly in both 2024 and 2025 compared to previous expectations. The reversal of supply shocks, coupled with monetary policy tightening, means that the path for inflation has been revised down over the entire projection horizon, although − compared with the previous projection round − underlying inflation is now expected to be more persistent in the near term (Chart 2).
Supporting the recovery, private consumption is expected to gradually strengthen as uncertainty – particularly around energy security – recedes and as declining inflation allows real disposable incomes to recover amid a favourable employment outlook. Nevertheless, a reduction in precautionary savings will be counteracted in part by higher interest rates, with the savings ratio expected to decline only gradually back to pre-pandemic levels over the medium term. The sizeable stock of excess savings built up during the pandemic is expected to remain largely intact (in nominal terms), in part due to its distribution being tilted to higher-income households, which have a relatively low propensity to consume.
The tightening of financing conditions and stricter credit standards are expected to weigh more strongly on both residential and business investment over the coming quarters, compared with previous projection rounds. Banks – already before the recent financial market turmoil – reported substantial tightening in credit standards and lending conditions to firms through the ECB’s Bank Lending Survey (BLS). Over the medium term, investment in commercial real estate is expected to be hit particularly hard by the tighter lending conditions, while the sharp projected slowdown in house prices will reduce residential investment. By contrast, business investment is likely to recover more strongly on the back of rising demand and strengthening business confidence, also supported by the deployment of Next Generation EU funds.
Taking a longer perspective, Chart 1 also shows that the projected paths for output, consumption and investment remain well below the pre-pandemic trends. This explains why it is possible to combine significant growth in the coming years with projections of substantial disinflation (as shown in Chart 2): the supply capacity of the economy is set to recover from the pandemic-related damage and the war-amplified energy shock, with the tightening in monetary policy ensuring that demand is better aligned with supply.
Since the cut-off date for the March 2023 projections, the incoming data have been mixed.Both business and consumer confidence have recovered strongly since the start of the year, albeit possibly softened by the recent banking sector turmoil. Business activity has continued to rebound, despite moderating slightly in March. However, these overall patterns mask a continued divergence at the sectoral level. In particular, the expansion of services business activity is accelerating, supported by a continuation of strong reopening effects and rising incomes, whereas manufacturing output stagnated in the first quarter of the year. Finally, incoming survey indicators suggest that the steady improvement in business and consumer sentiment, which remains at low levels, may have stalled.
To make sure that inflation returns to our two per cent target in a timely manner, it has been necessary to increase the key policy rates by 350 basis points since last summer. If the baseline scenario underlying the March ECB’s staff macroeconomic projections persists, it will be appropriate to raise rates further.
The ECB started to unwind its highly accommodative monetary policy in December 2021, when the Governing Council began reducing the pace of net asset purchases, followed by the decisions to end purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and asset purchase programme (APP) in March and June of 2022 respectively. In July 2022, we began raising the key ECB interest rates, which markets had already begun pricing in at the end of 2021. Since the start of the tightening cycle, we have brought the deposit facility rate (DFR) – which, in the current conditions of ample excess liquidity, constitutes the main instrument for steering the monetary policy stance – from negative territory to three per cent today (Chart 3).[2]
Both market pricing and our Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) foresee that the policy rate will rise further in the near term and will remain at elevated levels for an extended period. Moreover, once inflation has stabilised at the two per cent target in the medium term, it is projected that the policy rate will settle in the neighbourhood of two per cent, rather than returning to highly-accommodative super-low levels. This largely reflects the re-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations at our two per cent target and suggests that market participants and monetary analysts expect the longer-term equilibrium (inflation-adjusted) real rate will stand around zero per cent.
The substantial tightening in monetary policy is designed to make sure that inflation returns to our two percent target in a timely manner, both by ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored and by lowering price and costs pressures through the dampening of demand. An important channel in dampening demand is raising the financing costs facing firms.
The financing of firms
In general, firms finance themselves in four main ways: drawing on retained earnings; obtaining loans from banks; borrowing from bond markets; and raising equity (Chart 4). Clearly, tougher financing conditions will have a greater impact on firms that have a heavy reliance on external financing sources. In particular, early-stage firms that lack accumulated net worth and may be in a pre-profitability phase will be more heavily affected than mature firms which carry little debt. Looking across sectors, more capital-intensive sectors and sectors that produce durable goods will be more exposed than capital-light sectors and sectors that produce services for which demand is less sensitive to shifts in interest rates.
In terms of internal financing, higher interest rates make it more attractive for firms to place retained earnings on deposit or in interest-bearing financial instruments rather than using them to fund investment and working capital. Cash and deposits currently represent 8.6% of the total assets of firms. This share increased mainly during the pandemic, reflecting precautionary borrowing (Chart 4, left panel). More recent data up to February, however, shows signs of this trend reversing, in line with the decline in borrowing.
Let me start with bank-based finance, which makes up the bulk of debt financing of euro area firms.[3]The cost of borrowing from banks began trending up in early 2022, after the ECB initiated the winddown of its highly accommodative monetary policy stance in December 2021. The increase in borrowing costs has strongly accelerated following the first hike of the ECB key rates in July 2022 (Chart 5). At the start of this tightening cycle, there was some variation in the pass-through across countries. For instance, rates applied on new loans increased more strongly in Germany than in most other countries in early 2022. In recent months, however, lending rates have increased at a similar pace in all major economies. In February 2023, euro area firms were paying on average 250 basis points more in interest on new loans than they were at the end of 2021.
Developments in Ireland have followed a similar trajectory. In line with the long-standing pattern, Irish companies were already facing higher financing costs than the average euro area company at the end of 2021. This reflects the different economic structure of Ireland as a small open economy but also the legacy of the 2008-2013 financial crisis, which continues to have an impact on the cost of credit. In addition, limited competition in retail lending also affects lending rates, especially on loans to SMEs.[4]Nevertheless, the pass-through to corporate lending rates in Ireland has been similar to the euro area average in the current tightening phase, with the average cost of borrowing increasing by 240 basis points between the end of 2021 and February 2023.
Higher interest rates for firms are a result of our monetary policy tightening and a necessary step in the transmission to the financing conditions for firms. Risk-free rates have increased significantly since the start of our policy normalisation in December 2021. In the first half of 2022, this was limited to longer maturities as expectations of future rate hikes emerged, and as we reduced net purchases under the asset purchase programmes. Once we started raising our policy rates in July, short-term risk-free rates also increased (Chart 6). These two developments have led to an increase in the cost of the key funding sources for banks, namely bank bonds and, to a lesser extent, deposits. Bank bond yields, which are closely linked to longer-term risk-free rates, started increasing in early 2022. Following the hikes in the summer of 2022, banks also started passing these increases on to deposit rates. As the pass-through to deposit rates is more sluggish than that to market rates, composite bank funding costs have increased by around 140 basis points since the end of 2021, while bank bond yields increased by more than 300 basis points.
The pass-through of interest rate increases to deposit rates varies across the different deposit categories. Rates on corporate deposits with an agreed maturity have increased by around 260 basis points since the end of 2021 (Chart 7). This is broadly in line with the 300 basis point rise in the key ECB interest rates during the same period. On the other hand, rates on overnight deposits have increased by only 36 basis points. This widening of the spread between overnight deposit rates and policy rates is usually observed during interest rate hiking cycles. One reason for this is that overnight deposits offer liquidity and payment services that are often not explicitly priced. Due to these services and their very short maturity, in normal times the remuneration on these deposits tends to be considerably below the policy rate. This was not the case in the period when the policy rate was negative, as banks largely spared depositors (with the exception of large corporates) from negative rates. This is another reason why the increase in overnight deposit rates we have observed so far is smaller than the increase in policy rates.
Rates offered on corporate deposits in Ireland have developed quite similarly to the euro area average. Time deposits of firms were remunerated at 2.19 per cent on average in February 2023, which is around 260 basis points more than in December 2021. Rates on overnight deposits of firms have adjusted more slowly than in the euro area. These increased by 13 basis points to now stand at 0.05 per cent on average.
The increasing costs of funding for banks have been passed on substantially to lending rates applied to new loans. This reflects the fact that banks price new loans on the basis of their own funding costs plus a mark-up, depending, among other factors, on borrower risk characteristics. In addition, higher interest rates are typically associated with a decline in asset prices. This lowers the value of collateral, which leads to an additional increase in lending rates, above and beyond that associated with higher bank funding costs. In addition, banks pass on higher funding costs to outstanding debt when repricing floating-rate debt.
Banks also restrict the supply of credit by applying stricter loan approval criteria. This can be seen from our bank lending survey (BLS), which we run every quarter among a representative sample of euro area banks.[5]Banks have been reporting a tightening of their credit standards compared to the previous quarter throughout 2022. The reported net tightening – the key metric of the survey which captures the difference between the share of banks reporting tighter credit standards and the share of banks reporting easier credit standards – between the final quarter of 2022 and the survey conducted in July 2022 ranged from 15 to 27 per cent (Chart 8). The value reported at the end of 2022 is the sharpest tightening in credit standards since the sovereign debt crisis in 2011, albeit from a starting point in 2021 of highly accommodative conditions.
Among the key factors driving this tightening were an increase in the perceived risks related to the downgrades of the economic outlook during the course of 2022 and the deteriorating creditworthiness of borrowers, as well as lower risk tolerance on the part of banks. In addition, as tighter monetary policy raises the funding costs of banks and adversely affects their balance sheets, it also reduces their willingness to lend. The current round of our bank lending survey, to be published in early May, will give us a first indication of the impact of the recent financial tensions on credit conditions.
According to historical regularities, such a tightening of credit standards is usually followed by lower loan volumes several quarters later.[6]Indeed, bank lending to firms has been slowing down since the last quarter of 2022. Since November 2022, the aggregate flow of bank lending to firms in the euro area has been negative, indicating that more loans are maturing or being repaid than are being issued.
As the cost of borrowing increased and banks tightened their requirements for loan approvals, bank lending to firms has slowed. Bank credit as a share of GDP is declining – faster, in fact, than in previous tightening episodes – and markets expect it to decline significantly further this year (Chart 9). There are several factors driving this. First, the current tightening has occurred against the backdrop of adverse aggregate supply shocks. Second, the current reduction in credit supply is stronger than usual, mainly reflecting heightened risk perceptions on the bank side. Third, the pace and size of the current policy rate increases is extraordinary. This might imply a higher sensitivity of borrowing to rate increases at the current juncture.
The second source of external financing for firms is through corporate bond issuance. Net issuance of debt securities was basically flat in the first three quarters of 2022 (Chart 10). Tighter monetary policy increases the cost of market-based debt more quickly than that of bank loans.[7]Market-based finance became relatively more expensive in the initial tightening phase, leading to a shift from debt issuance to bank loans. However, the acceleration of the pass-through to lending rates in the last quarter of 2022 has reduced the relative attractiveness of bank loans, leading to a rebound in corporate bond issuance at the end of 2022. In February of this year, however, net issuance of corporate bonds turned negative again, meaning that firms are now issuing fewer new securities than are maturing. Together with the negative bank lending flows, this contributes to the fast decline in overall debt financing obtained by firms.
I now turn to the cost of corporate bond financing in more detail. The average yield on non-financial corporate bonds has increased by over 300 basis points since the end of 2021. This increase is similar to the increase in the cost of bank bond funding. It largely reflects changes in the risk-free rates due to the monetary policy tightening, as spreads – the difference between bond yields and risk-free rates – have increased less strongly over the same period (Chart 11). Corporate bond spreads have relatively contained for both investment grade and high-yield securities during this tightening cycle, despite several episodic spikes. These bond spreads currently stand higher than in late 2021, at the beginning of our monetary policy normalisation cycle, but have remained roughly at the same level since June 2022.[8]
The increase in spreads in the first half of 2022 points to increasing credit risk concerns in financial markets in the context of high macroeconomic uncertainty due to the Russian war against Ukraine and the energy price shock. While spreads showed some volatility since the summer of 2022, these had almost fully returned to 2021 levels before the banking turmoil triggered by the collapse of several mid-sized banks in the United States in March 2023. This episode led to a significant increase in spreads for both safer and riskier bonds, given the prevailing risk-off attitude in markets. However, spreads have already partly reversed these increases in the last few weeks.
Under the surface of these aggregate developments across euro area firms, we also observe some important differences between firms across sectors and sizes.
Results from our recent bank lending survey, conducted in January 2023, show that banks are particularly concerned about firms operating in energy-intensive manufacturing, commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors (Chart 12, left panel). Over the second half of 2022, the net percentage of banks reporting tighter credit standards was clearly larger for these sectors than it was across all sectors. This likely reflects perceptions of elevated risk for these firms.
Tighter credit standards for energy-intensive companies, are linked to the high costs of energy, which may lower the debt servicing capacities of these companies and therefore make them riskier from the perspective of banks. Banks have also been more restrictive towards the real estate sector, especially commercial real estate, since the second half of 2021. This may reflect concerns about commercial real estate valuations, as the demand for offices remains uncertain given changes in the prevalence of working-from-home following the pandemic lockdowns.[9]Since early 2022, rising financing costs and broader macro-financial uncertainty have added further pressure to the market. Finally, the strong price growth in the years leading up to the pandemic may have resulted in overvaluation in some real estate markets, further increasing possible vulnerabilities.[10]
Concerns about borrower creditworthiness are also more pronounced for small firms than for large ones. Since the end of 2021, firm-level probabilities of default as reported by banks have increased more strongly for SMEs (Chart 12, right panel). SMEs are generally considered riskier by banks because their business models are less diversified, making them potentially more vulnerable to shocks.[11]In addition, it is considered more difficult to assess their financial health by outsiders as SMEs are subject to fewer disclosure requirements. In line with these considerations, banks appear to view them as more vulnerable in the current environment of rising rates, leading to the faster increase in probabilities of default.
These differences across sectors and firm sizes are also reflected in differences in financing constraints as perceived by firms. In the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises , covering the period March to September 2022, compared with larger and older firms respectively, a greater share of smaller and younger firms reported financing constraints when applying for a bank loan (Chart 13). Young firms and SMEs also saw a stronger increase in the share of firms facing financing constraints than other firms compared with the previous year . Similarly, firms from the construction sector were more likely to report having encountered financing constraints compared to other firms and compared to the previous year.
The final source of financing for firms is through the issuance of equity, in particular listed shares. One way to measure this is to consider the cost of equity, which is calculated as the sum of the long-term risk-free rate and the equity risk premium – that is, the additional compensation demanded by investors for the risk of holding stocks. The nominal cost of equity for euro area firms has also remained contained during the ongoing monetary policy tightening phase (Chart 14, left panel). Despite temporary increases in 2022, there has been an overall decline by around 130 basis points in the cost of equity since end-2021 as increasing risk-free rates have been more than offset by a lower equity risk premium, reflecting overall positive market risk sentiment.
At the same time, stock market developments have also differed across economic sectors. Since the end of 2021, stock market valuations declined disproportionately for sectors which tend to be more sensitive to interest-rate changes such as technology or cyclical consumer products (Chart 14, right panel). In line with the more negative view of banks, equity valuations for the real estate sector also declined strongly, despite showing lower rate-sensitivity than other sectors.
Conclusion
Making sure that inflation returns to our two percent target in a timely manner has required a substantial increase in interest rates. By bringing interest rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and fostering a period of below-trend growth through the dampening of demand, we will counteract above-target medium-term inflation pressures and also ensure that the prolonged phase of above-target inflation does not become embedded through a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. In particular, the dampening of demand through the tightening of monetary policy means that price setters and wage-setters are on notice that excessive price and wage increases will not be sustainable.
In our March monetary policy meeting, with rates firmly in restrictive territory, we announced that future policy rate decisions would be determined by an assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. This assessment will include close inspection of developments in the financing conditions facing firms. In addition to monitoring the transmission of our policy rates to bank lending rates and bond yields, the April bank lending survey will be an important input for our May meeting. In particular, the bank lending survey will help us assess any spillovers from events in the US and Swiss banking systems to credit supply and credit demand in the euro area. Moreover, the April Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS) will provide us with feedback from the corporate sector, including in relation to financing conditions. Looking further ahead, the next Survey on Access to Finance (SAFE) will supply comprehensive information on the financing conditions facing firms in time for our June meeting."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Council on Foreign Relations’ C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics
New York, 17 April 2023
It is a pleasure to be here in New York.
The global economy has been undergoing a period of transformative change. Following the pandemic, Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine, the weaponisation of energy, the sudden acceleration of inflation, as well as a growing rivalry between the United States and China, the tectonic plates of geopolitics are shifting faster.
We are witnessing a fragmentation of the global economy into competing blocs, with each bloc trying to pull as much of the rest of the world closer to its respective strategic interests and shared values. And this fragmentation may well coalesce around two blocs led respectively by the two largest economies in the world.
All this could have far-reaching implications across many domains of policymaking. And today in my remarks, I would like to explore what the implications might be for central banks.
In short, we could see two profound effects on the policy environment for central banks: first, we may see more instability as global supply elasticity wanes; and second, we could see more multipolarity as geopolitical tensions continue to mount.
A changing global economy
In the time after the Cold War, the world benefited from a remarkably favourable geopolitical environment. Under the hegemonic leadership of the United States, rules-based international institutions flourished and global trade expanded. This led to a deepening of global value chains and, as China joined the world economy, a massive increase in the global labour supply.
As a result, global supply became more elastic to changes in domestic demand, leading to a long period of relatively low and stable inflation.[1]That in turn underpinned a policy framework in which independent central banks could focus on stabilising inflation by steering demand without having to pay too much attention to supply-side disruptions.[2]
But that period of relative stability may now be giving way to one of lasting instability resulting in lower growth, higher costs and more uncertain trade partnerships. Instead of more elastic global supply, we could face the risk of repeated supply shocks. Recent events have laid bare the extent to which critical supplies depend on stable global conditions.
That has been most visible in the European energy crisis, but it extends to other critical supplies as well. Today the United States is completely dependent on imports for at least 14 critical minerals.[3]And Europe depends on China for 98% of its rare earth supply.[4]Supply disruptions on these fronts could affect critical sectors in the economy, such as the automobile industry and its transition to electric vehicle production.
In response, governments are legislating to increase supply security, notably through the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the strategic autonomy agenda in Europe. But that could, in turn, accelerate fragmentation as firms also adjust in anticipation. Indeed, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the share of global firms planning to regionalise their supply chain almost doubled – to around 45% – compared with a year earlier.[5]
This “new global map” – as I have called these changes elsewhere[6]– is likely to have first-order implications for central banks.
One recent study based on data since 1900 finds that geopolitical risks led to high inflation, lower economic activity and a fall in international trade.[7]And ECB analysis suggests similar outcomes may be expected for the future. If global value chains fragment along geopolitical lines, the increase in the global level of consumer prices could range between around 5% in the short run and roughly 1% in the long run.[8]
These changes also suggest that a second shift in the central bank landscape is taking place: we may see the world becoming more multipolar.
During thePax Americanaafter 1945, the US dollar became firmly ensconced as the global reserve and transaction currency, and more recently, the euro has risen to second place.[9]This had a range of − mostly beneficial − implications for central banks. For example, the ability of central banks to act as the “conductor of the international orchestra” as noted by Keynes, or even firms being able to invoice in their domestic currencies, which made import prices more stable.[10]
In parallel, Western payments infrastructures assumed an increasingly global role. For instance, in the decade after the Berlin Wall fell, the number of countries using the payments messaging network SWIFT more than doubled.[11]And by 2020, over 90% of cross-border transmissions were being signalled through SWIFT.[12]
But new trade patterns may have ramifications for payments and international currency reserves.
In recent decades China has already increased over 130-fold its bilateral trade in goods with emerging markets and developing economies, with the country also becoming the world’s top exporter.[13]And recent research indicates there is a significant correlation between a country’s trade with China and its holdings of renminbi as reserves.[14]New trade patterns may also lead to new alliances. One study finds that alliances can increase the share of a currency in the partner’s reserve holdings by roughly 30 percentage points.[15]
All this could create an opportunity for certain countries seeking to reduce their dependency on Western payment systems and currency frameworks – be that for reasons of political preference, financial dependencies, or because of the use of financial sanctions in the past decade.[16]
Anecdotal evidence, including official statements, suggests that some countries intend to increase their use of alternatives to major traditional currencies for invoicing international trade, such as the Chinese renminbi or the Indian rupee.[17]We are also seeing increased accumulation of gold as an alternative reserve asset, possibly driven by countries with closer geopolitical ties to China and Russia.[18]
There are also attempts to create alternatives to SWIFT. Since 2014, Russia has developed such a system for domestic and cross-border use, with over 50 banks across a dozen countries using it last year.[19]And since 2015 China has established its own system to clear payments in renminbi.
These developments do not point to any imminent loss of dominance for the US dollar or the euro. So far, the data do not show substantial changes in the use of international currencies. But they do suggest that international currency status should no longer be taken for granted.
Policy frameworks for a fragmenting world
How should central banks respond to these twin challenges?
We have clear examples of whatnotto do when faced with a sudden increase in volatility. In the 1970s, central banks faced upheaval in the geopolitical environment as OPEC became more assertive and energy prices that had been stable for decades ballooned. They failed to provide an anchor of monetary stability and inflation expectations de-anchored – a mistake that should never be repeated for as long as central banks are independent and have clear price stability mandates.
So, if faced with persistent supply shocks, independent central banks can and will go ahead with ensuring price stability. But this can be achieved at a lower cost if other policies are cooperative and help replenish supply capacity.
For example, if fiscal and structural policies focus on removing supply constraints created by the new geopolitics – such as securing resilient supply chains or diversifying energy production– we could then see a virtuous circle of lower volatility, lower inflation, higher investment, and higher growth. But if fiscal policy instead focuses mainly on supporting incomes to offset cost pressures (in excess of temporary and targeted responses to sudden large shocks), that will tend to raise inflation, increase borrowing costs and lower investment in new supply.
In this sense, insofar as geopolitics leads to a fragmentation of the global economy into competing blocs, this calls for greater policy cohesion. Not compromising independence, but recognisinginterdependencebetween policies, and how each can best achieve their objective if aligned behind a strategic goal.
We could see the benefits of this in Europe especially, where the multiplier effect of common action in areas such as industrial policy, defence and investing in green and digital technologies is much higher than Member States acting alone.
There is another benefit, too: achieving the right policy framework will not only determine how our economies fare at home, but also how they are viewed globally in a context of greater “system competition”. And while the international institutions established in the wake of Bretton Woods remain instrumental for fostering a rules-based multilateral order, the prospect of multipolarity raises the stakes for such internal policy cohesion.
For a start, an economic policy mix that produces less volatile growth and inflation will be key in continuing to attract international investment. Although 50-60% of foreign-held US short-term assets are in the hands of governments with strong ties to the United States – meaning they are unlikely to be divested for geopolitical reasons[20]– the single most important factor influencing international currency usage remains strength of fundamentals.[21]
By the same token, for Europe, long-delayed projects such as deepening and integrating our capital markets can no longer be viewed solely through the lens of domestic financial policy. To put it bluntly, we need to complete the European capital markets union. This will be pivotal in determining whether the euro remains among the leading global currencies or others take its place.
Central banks also have an important role to play here – even as protagonists.
For example, the manner in which swap lines are used could influence the dynamics of major international currencies.[22]Both the Federal Reserve and the ECB, within their respective mandates, have been proactive in providing offshore liquidity when recent crises have hit. But others are moving too, which is consistent with a rising role of their currencies. We have already seen the People’s Bank of China set up over 30 bilateral swap lines with other central banks to compensate for the lack of liquid financial markets in renminbi.[23]
How central banks navigate the digital era – such as innovating their payment systems and issuing digital currencies – will also be critical for which currencies ultimately rise and fall. This is an important reason why the ECB is exploring in depth how a digital euro could best work if launched.
So, we need to be ready for the new reality that may well lie ahead. The time to think about how to respond to changing geopolitics is not when fragmentation is upon us, but before. Because, if I may paraphrase Ernest Hemingway, fragmentation can happen in two ways: gradually, and then suddenly.[24]
Central banks must provide for stability in an age that is anything but stable. And I have no doubt that central banks will measure up to the challenge.
Thank you."

Statement by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the forty-seventh meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee
IMF Spring Meetings, 14 April 2023
Introduction
Since the October meeting, the global economic outlook has improved on the back of a gradual easing of global supply bottlenecks, declining energy prices, and the recovery of the Chinese economy following the lifting of pandemic-related containment measures. Global inflation has also been declining since it peaked in summer 2022, supported by easing supply constraints, as well as by the tightening of monetary policy among advanced economies. However, the recovery prospects for the global economy remain fragile amid continued uncertainty, fuelled by Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine, and the possibility that pressures in global energy and food markets may reappear, leading to renewed price spikes and higher inflation. Resilient labour markets and strong wage growth, especially in advanced economies, suggest that underlying inflationary pressures remain strong. At the same time, other factors that may accelerate disinflation include: persistently elevated financial market tensions, falling energy prices, and a weakening of demand, owing also in part to a stronger deceleration of bank credit or a stronger than projected transmission of monetary policy.
As inflation is projected to remain too high for too long, the Governing Council of the ECB decided in March to raise the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, bringing the total increase since July 2022 to 350 basis points. These increases underline our determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependant approach to our policy rate decisions, which will be determined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The asset purchase programme portfolio has been declining at a measured and predictable pace since March 2023, as the Eurosystem is no longer reinvesting all of the principal payments from maturing securities. Regarding the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the Governing Council intends to reinvest all principal payments from maturing securities purchased under it until at least the end of 2024 and will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions.
We are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. In any case, our policy toolkit fully equips us to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
Economic activity
Growth in euro area GDP slowed progressively over the course of last year and stagnated in the fourth quarter. Employment growth also slowed in 2022, but remained resilient in the fourth quarter despite the moderation in economic activity, while the unemployment rate remained at a record low level. Survey data into the first quarter of this year suggested some improvement in activity and confidence in the first quarter of 2023. Under the baseline scenario in the ECB staff projections (which were finalised before the emergence of financial market tensions in mid-March 2023), the euro area economy looks set to recover over the coming quarters as the labour market remains strong, supply bottlenecks are resolved, and inflation moderates.
Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside. Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. Euro area growth could also be dragged down if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected. However, if companies can adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment, this, coupled with the fading-out of the energy shock, could support higher growth than currently expected.
Government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted, and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. As energy prices fall and risks around the energy supply recede, it is important to start rolling back these measures promptly and concertedly. Falling short of these principles can drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making economies more productive and gradually reducing high public debt. Finally, countries should implement structural policies for intensifying their efforts to green and digitalise their economies.
Inflation
Euro area headline inflation declined from its October peak, reflecting a drop in energy inflation. Downward base effects, an easing of energy commodity prices, and the impact of government measures to shield consumers from high energy prices all contributed to this decline. By contrast, food and core inflation rates continued to rise, partly as a result of the past surge in energy and other input costs still feeding through to consumer prices. Pent-up demand related to the reopening of the economy and the lagged impact of supply bottlenecks also continue to push prices up. At the same time, employees demanding compensation for the loss in purchasing power amid tight labour markets has translated into higher wage growth, while many firms in sectors facing constrained supply and resurgent demand raised their profit margins.
We expect euro area inflation to continue to fall, as lagged price pressures fade out and tighter monetary policy increasingly dampens demand. However, historically high wage growth, related to tight labour markets and compensation for high inflation, will support core inflation over the projection horizon, as it gradually returns to rates around our target. This outlook remains surrounded by considerable uncertainty, with both upside and downside risks. Stronger than expected pipeline pressures or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profits could drive up inflation, while financial market tensions and falling energy prices could lead to faster disinflation. At the same time, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, although they warrant continued monitoring.
Euro area banking sector, non-bank financial sector and financial stability
Euro area banks remain resilient in the current market environment thanks to strong capital and liquidity positions. Since the start of the ECB’s policy rate hiking cycle, euro area bank profitability has been boosted by higher interest margins, while the change in impairments and provisions has been rather muted so far. However, in the current environment of tightening financing conditions including for banks, credit risks have increased, and lending dynamics have substantially weakened, which may weigh on future bank profitability.
The decrease in bank lending to firms has, in general, not been offset by an increased recourse of firms to market-based financing, despite a bout of corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of 2022. Looking ahead, the decline in the asset purchase programme portfolio will increase the share of debt issuance that needs to be absorbed by investors. Based on their past behaviour, investment funds appear able to absorb part of such an increase. At the same time, in spite of some reduction in exposure to higher-risk assets, structural vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector remain elevated. Risks in that sector may arise especially from liquidity mismatch and leverage, which could adversely affect market conditions should risks materialise. Priority should be given to policies that help build resilience by reducing liquidity mismatch, mitigating risk from non-bank financial sector leverage, and enhancing liquidity preparedness in the broader non-bank financial sector.
International support for Ukraine and most vulnerable countries
We welcome the IMF’s continued support for Ukraine, including the recently approved fully fledged lending arrangement. Together with strong international support, the arrangement will be essential for addressing Ukraine’s immediate financial needs and in catalysing additional financial assistance. We note that all adjustments to the IMF’s lending policies and toolkit are uniformly applicable to those meeting the relevant criteria from the Fund’s broad membership.
In view of rising debt vulnerabilities, support for vulnerable countries remains high on the international agenda. We welcome the first successful conclusion of debt restructuring under the G20-Paris Club Common Framework last year and encourage debt treatments of other applicant countries to be finalised promptly. Efficient creditor coordination and debt transparency remain key.
We note strong demand for Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) financing, following its successful launch in late 2022, and welcome the good progress achieved. Initiatives to ensure the resource adequacy of the RST and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust should maintain the reserve asset character of claims on the loan and deposit accounts of these trusts. This is essential for contributions made by EU national central banks. However, we note that the channelling of special drawing rights by EU national central banks to multilateral development banks or individual countries would not be compatible with the EU’s legal framework.
Supporting international cooperation and strengthening the global economy
Recent global shocks and geopolitical tensions have advanced the debate about reconfiguring global supply chains. While the increased resilience associated with less complex supply chains is desirable, a less integrated world economy also entails costs. It weakens the diversification of global production and, in particular, the efficient allocation of resources globally, which has an adverse impact on welfare across the world. Geopolitical fragmentation may also affect the global economy via financial channels. The availability of external financing may be impeded, and lower foreign direct investment would hinder the diffusion of technology and thus productivity growth.
All of these developments require our immediate attention; however, we are not losing sight of longer-term challenges and are keeping up our efforts to address the existential crisis of climate change. As part of our action plan to incorporate climate change considerations in our monetary policy framework, we decided to tilt corporate bond holdings towards issuers with better climate performance, through the reinvestment of redemptions starting in October 2022. Our climate-related financial disclosures showed last month that this effort was helping reduce the carbon footprint of our corporate sector portfolios. In addition, we are adjusting the collateral framework, introducing climate-related disclosure requirements, and enhancing risk management practices. Recently, we have also issued statistical indicators for climate-related analysis. Moreover, tackling climate-related and environmental risks is one of the ECB’s key supervisory priorities for 2023-25. Supervisors have set institution-specific remediation timelines for achieving full alignment with supervisory expectations by the end of 2024 and will follow up on the deficiencies identified in stress tests and thematic reviews performed in 2022.
The investigation phase of the digital euro project is on track. In the autumn, we expect to decide on the next project phase, in which the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro would be developed and tested. While a digital euro would focus first on the domestic retail payments market in Europe, we are already discussing at the international level the potential of cross-currency and cross-border payments made in retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). There is agreement that CBDC should eventually contribute to improving cross-border payments. As global work on CBDC accelerates, international cooperation in this field will become even more important."

Introductory remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 34thedition of “The outlook for the economy and finance”, organized by the European House – Ambrosetti
Cernobbio, 1 April 2023
Financial stability is essential to the ECB’s primary objective of price stability. The events of the past few weeks have reminded us of the benefits of strong and harmonised banking regulation and the importance of completing the banking union. We are closely monitoring developments in financial markets and financial institutions.
The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions that are well above the minimum requirements. And banks currently meet a very large portion of the liquidity requirements with the most liquid asset available – reserves held at the central bank. This situation is very different to 2008 and 2009. Since then, harmonised European banking supervision has been set up and we have made good progress in implementing the global regulatory reform agenda that was launched in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. But there is no room for complacency.
Recent events in financial markets have heightened uncertainty, which may hamper the transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. And we are likely to see a further increase in banks’ cost of funding, a tightening of credit standards and a deceleration in the growth of lending volumes. There could also be a drop in consumer and investor confidence and lower overall aggregate demand. However, it is too early to draw conclusions about the impact all of this will have on growth and inflation. The turbulence may well be short-lived, but if amplification effects do emerge, they will show up in the data.
In this context of heightened uncertainty, our approach to bringing inflation down to our 2% medium-term target will remain data-dependent. As we clarified in our latest press conference, our future policy path will be determined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We believe that headline inflation is likely to decline considerably this year, while underlying inflation dynamics will remain strong.
We came from double-digit monthly inflation in the euro area towards the end of 2022. Inflation has been edging downwards, falling to 8.5% in February, to 6.9% in March (flash estimate), and we expect it to continue to decline steadily thanks to lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and a slight appreciation of the euro. In fact, energy inflation peaked in 2022 and should be around zero or even negative this year. But factors contributing to inflation are changing – food and non-energy industrial goods inflation will likely only reach its peak in 2023, sustaining the pressure on core inflation, which edged up to 5.7% in March (flash estimate).
We have to pay particular attention to factors that could pose upside risks to inflation. The first of these is rising wage growth, which has a significant impact on the price of services. There are no clear signs of a self-sustaining wage-price spiral, but these risks need to be monitored. Labour markets are tight, unemployment is low and people feel secure in their jobs, which is very positive. But compensation for high inflation is a main theme in wage negotiations and nominal wages are expected to grow in 2023. We are also closely monitoring underlying inflationary pressures stemming from profits. Profits margins have grown much more than labour costs in some economic sectors. The feedback between higher profit margins, higher wages and higher prices could pose more lasting upside risks to inflation.
Developments in China are another factor that merits our attention. China’s reopening is clearly positive for growth, but a stronger than expected rebound could boost foreign demand and add to commodity price pressures.
We also need to pay attention to how fiscal support measures develop over time. Governments’ discretionary policy response to the high energy prices and inflation was close to 2% of GDP in 2022 and is anticipated to be at the same level this year. Fiscal measures tend to reduce inflation in the short term, but we expect the opposite to be true as they start to be withdrawn in 2024, leading to higher inflation in 2024 and 2025.
This discretionary fiscal support initially increases GDP growth and supports households’ nominal disposable income. However, only a small share of the support is actually targeted at lower-income households. As the energy crisis becomes less acute, it is important that governments start rolling back fiscal measures. The increased burden on public finances, especially if the support is extended through more long-lasting measures, may pose additional challenges in Europe.[1]Public debt ratios are higher than in the past, following the determined and effective fiscal policy response to the pandemic, and debt servicing costs are higher as well. Member States should also take note of the European Commission’s fiscal policy guidance for 2024.
Turning to growth, we moved away from a baseline scenario with a technical recession at the turn of the year, as economic activity proved to be more resilient than expected at the end of 2022. In our March projections, the outlook for growth was revised up, to an average of 1% in 2023. However, these projections were finalised before the events of the past few weeks, which are now adding uncertainty to our assessments. Nevertheless, reduced concerns about energy shortages and price increases, coupled with the continued resilience of the labour market, are expected to support activity over the coming quarters. In short, the growth outlook remains weak, but it has improved somewhat.
At the Governing Council meeting in March, we decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with our determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. As part of the monetary policy normalisation process, from the beginning of March, our asset purchase programme portfolio has been declining at a pace of €15 billion per month, on average, and it will continue to decline at this pace until the end of June 2023, while its subsequent pace will be determined overtime. Uncertainty has increased, so we are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area.
But let me go back to financial stability. Just a few weeks ago, before tensions in financial markets emerged on both sides of the Atlantic, the overall improvement in the outlook for growth and inflation was supporting overly benign macro-financial expectations on the part of banks and financial market participants.
Despite rising funding costs, bank profitability has improved, driven by significantly higher net interest income while impairments and provisions have been muted so far. Overall, from a system-wide perspective, euro area banks are moderately exposed to interest rate risk. Most are actually positioned to initially benefit from increasing interest rates, which boost net interest margins. On average, loan book repricing tends to more than offset higher funding costs and mark-to-market losses on fixed income securities. It is inevitable however that, with the tightening of financing conditions and in line with our policy objective, lending dynamics are weakening and may weigh on bank profitability going forward.
Of course, certain bank business models may be more vulnerable to this transition. But, in our view, vulnerabilities in the financial system prevail in the non-bank financial sector, which grew fast and increased its risk-taking during the low interest rate environment. Credit and liquidity risk remain high, making the sector more vulnerable to market volatility and an abrupt repricing in financial markets. Despite some recent de-risking, structural liquidity mismatch prevails in the non-bank financial sector and market corrections could be amplified by forced selling into illiquid markets.
It is critical that policy reforms are pursued to address these vulnerabilities. Priority should be given to policies that help build resilience in the sector, such as by reducing liquidity mismatch, mitigating risk from leverage, and enhancing liquidity preparedness across a broad range of institutions."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an event organised by Columbia University and SGH Macro Advisors
New York, 27 March 2023
On 1 March, the ECB started quantitative tightening (QT) after eight years of balance sheet expansion.[1]At the peak in 2022, the Eurosystem held monetary policy assets corresponding to around 56% of euro area GDP. This was substantial both from a historical perspective and in international comparison (Slide 2, left-hand side).
The first wave of balance sheet expansion was a response to the low-inflation environment prevailing in the aftermath of the euro area sovereign debt crisis. Between 2014 and 2016 headline inflation ran persistently below our target of 2%, averaging just 0.3% (Slide 2, right-hand side).[2]
As the key policy rate had already been lowered into negative territory in 2014 and was approaching the effective lower bound, the ECB started employing “unconventional” monetary policy tools. It offered banks a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and conducted asset purchases to stimulate economic activity and raise inflation.
These operations led to a sharp increase in monetary policy assets and, correspondingly, to a rise in central bank liabilities in the form of excess reserves – that is, reserves held by banks beyond minimum requirements (Slide 3).
The second wave of balance sheet expansion came with the ECB’s response to the pandemic. The launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and adjustments to the third series of TLTROs resulted in a further large increase of our monetary policy assets. These measures were necessary to protect the euro area economy from falling into a full-blown financial crisis and economic depression.[3]
Last July, balance sheet growth came to a halt when we ended net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP). Since autumn, the size of the balance sheet has been declining as banks began repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans. The balance sheet has declined further since the beginning of March, when we stopped fully reinvesting maturing securities bought under the APP.[4]
Further TLTRO repayments and a gradual run-down of our monetary policy bond portfolio imply that our balance sheet is expected to decline meaningfully over the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity.[5]
However, the size of our balance sheet will not return to the levels seen before the global financial crisis. Over the long run, the ECB’s balance sheet size is driven by growth in reserve requirements and by what are known as autonomous factors, which are beyond the control of the Eurosystem.[6]
Autonomous factors include official sector deposits and, most importantly, banknotes in circulation, which have shown a strong upward trend since 2007.[7]If, over the coming years, these autonomous factors were to increase in line with recent historical patterns, we estimate that excess liquidity will be fully absorbed by 2029.[8]
At that point, the Eurosystem’s balance sheet would still be about three times the size it was in 2007, and it would need to increase again to meet growth in currency demand.
From a monetary policy perspective, the question is whether the decline in the volume of excess reserves will affect our ability to implement monetary policy. In recent years, excess reserves have been instrumental in effectively steering short-term interest rates.
In my remarks today, I will first explain why the decline in excess reserves matters for the conduct of monetary policy. I will also describe why it may be difficult to return to the way we implemented monetary policy before 2008, when excess liquidity was limited.
I will then illustrate the benefits and costs of alternative operational frameworks that differ in the way they provide reserves to the banking system, and discuss how these may accommodate the characteristics of a heterogeneous currency union like the euro area.
These remarks reflect my own current thinking on the matter, which may evolve as the Governing Council reviews the Eurosystem’s operational framework – a process we hope to conclude before the end of the year.
From corridor to floor: the role of excess reserves
Before 2008, the ECB, and most other major central banks, implemented monetary policy in a “corridor” system. This means we provided just enough central bank reserves to meet banks’ aggregate liquidity needs stemming from net autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements.
In matching supply and demand in aggregate terms, the ECB steered unsecured overnight rates to the middle of the corridor (Slide 4).[9]As a result, excess liquidity was negligible. This framework was successful in practice: the ECB was able to closely align overnight rates with the interest rate charged on our weekly main refinancing operations (MRO) (Slide 5).
However, after 2008 periods of rising excess liquidity due to monetary policy operations repeatedly pushed unsecured overnight rates towards the deposit facility rate (DFR), which is the floor of the interest rate corridor. When we launched the APP in 2015 and excess liquidity started to grow rapidly, we effectively moved from a “corridor” towards a “floor” system.
Conceptually, the supply curve shifted further and further to the right, now crossing the demand curve at its flat, highly elastic part, where discrete changes in liquidity have very little effect on the level of short-term interest rates (Slide 6).
Balance sheet run-down will reverse this shift, progressively moving the supply curve back towards the steep part of the demand curve. In the current situation, the large volume of excess reserves means that we should still be at a significant distance from that point. Yet, uncertainty about the exact location of the “kink” is very high.
One reason for this is that years of large excess reserves have blurred our understanding of banks’ underlying demand for liquidity. The aggregate level of reserves has been largely determined by the quantity of asset purchases rather than by banks’ liquidity choices.
Should the demand for reserves have shifted more fundamentally, then upward pressure on interest rates may well start earlier than estimates of the historical relationship between the level of excess reserves and market rates would suggest (Slide 7).
This is broadly what happened in the United States in the autumn of 2019, when interest rate volatility spiked unexpectedly although the supply of reserves was still considerably above what banks had indicated in surveys as their lowest comfortable level.[10]
It is therefore prudent to start reviewing the options available to ensure thatthe ECB maintains control over the level of short-term money market rates during the process of balance sheet normalisation.
Reserve demand has become larger and less predictable
The natural starting point for a discussion about the operational framework is to ask what has changed since we last operated in an environment of balanced liquidity conditions.
The ability to effectively steer overnight rates in the pre-2008 corridor framework relied heavily on two features.
The first was our ability to accurately predict the reserves needed to steer the operational target towards the middle of the corridor. In the steep part of the demand curve, even small changes in the supply of, or demand for, reserves can lead to large swings in interest rates.
The second feature was a well-functioning interbank market that distributed central bank reserves efficiently across the euro area banking system. The standing facilities were not designed to be used on a regular basis but were supposed to accommodate unforeseen liquidity shocks.[11]
Over the past decade, however, the environment in which central banks operate has changed fundamentally.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, large excess reserves and prevailing fragmentation have considerably reduced the volume of reserves intermediated through the unsecured interbank market (Slide 8).
It is not clear whether the interbank market will recover once excess reserves become scarcer.
A structural decline in banks’ risk tolerance may have permanently reduced the capacity of the euro area interbank market to efficiently distribute reserves across banks all over the euro area. And while tighter financial regulation has made our financial system safer and more resilient, it has made interbank lending more costly.[12]
Banks might also want to hold much higher liquidity buffers than in the past. The recent experience of Sveriges Riksbank is a case in point.
In recent weeks, it regularly issued certificates amounting to the estimated liquidity surplus of the banking system to steer the Swedish Krona short-term rate to the middle of the interest rate corridor.
However, banks often decided to hold on to about one fifth of excess reserves which they placed in the deposit facility that pays a lower rate of remuneration, so that the short-term rate remained stuck to the floor of the corridor (Slide 9).
This points to banks’ strong preference for reserves, which may affect the ability of central banks to effectively steer short-term rates in a large corridor system, such as the one we had before 2008.[13]
There are two main reasons as to why banks may today wish to hold a higher level of excess reserves.
One relates to regulatory changes. The introduction of Basel III has resulted in a measurable increase in the demand for high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that banks need to hold to comply with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).[14]
Many euro area banks currently use excess reserves to meet regulatory requirements, especially in those countries with high excess liquidity. For the euro area as a whole, excess reserves currently account for 60% of HQLA holdings (Slide 10).
The second factor relates to banks’ precautionary behaviour in guarding against liquidity risks, as the turbulent events in the past few weeks forcefully underline.
Overnight deposits at euro area banks have shown an upward trend in relation to banks’ total deposits until about mid-2022 (Slide 11, left-hand side).[15]As a result, the risk of withdrawals or portfolio rebalancing has increased.
The rise in overnight deposits is in part a mechanical effect of asset purchases, which increase deposit holdings of those selling bonds to the Eurosystem. It also reflects the long period of very low interest rates that sharply reduced the opportunity costs of holding “money-like” claims.
Both of these effects can be expected to reverse as we remove monetary policy accommodation.
When we last increased interest rates, from 2005 until mid-2008, overnight deposits as a share of total deposits fell by about seven percentage points as firms and households shifted savings into less fungible term deposits that earn a higher rate of remuneration, a development that started only recently in the current hiking cycle (Slide 11, right-hand side).
However, even if funding became more stable again over time, banks would be likely to want to hold larger liquidity buffers to meet potential outflows.[16]And they would want to hold such buffers, at least in part, in central bank reserves as these do not need to be liquidated and, unlike marketable safe and liquid assets, are not subject to valuation changes.
The current environment vividly demonstrates that such valuation changes can be a source of instability for banks and markets.
Steering interest rates when the demand for reserves is uncertain
These developments do not necessarily suggest that a return to the pre-2008 corridor framework is undesirable or infeasible. After all, reserve demand may become more predictable over time and balance sheet run-down will increase the availability of marketable HQLA which banks can use to comply with their regulatory requirements.
But they do suggest that it may have become more difficult for central banks to correctly anticipate the demand for reserves and hence to steer interest rates in a wide corridor, and that such steering would entail a higher operational burden, both for the central bank and the banking system at large, with the need for more frequent fine-tuning operations.
What, then, might be the alternatives to the pre-2008 corridor framework?
The recent experience of other major central banks suggests that policymakers have two broad options: one is to formally adopt the current floor system by maintaining a sufficiently large bond portfolio on the asset side; the other is to offer, either in a floor or a narrow-corridor framework, regular collateralised lending operations that ensure that banks are able to maintain their desired level of reserve holdings as balance sheet reduction proceeds.
While both options can be expected to have a similar capacity to maintain control over overnight interest rates, they differ in their impact on the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet, and in their ability to deal with the idiosyncratic features of the Eurosystem.
The first option is broadly how the Federal Reserve manages its balance sheet.[17]
The Federal Reserve aims to keep a sufficiently large buffer of excess reserves in the system so that the effective federal funds rate – the rate at which banks and certain other institutions lend to each other – trades close to the interest rate paid on reserve balances. This is the “floor” below which banks are better off depositing with the Federal Reserve than lending in the market (Slide 12).
As not all financial market participants have access to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the floor might be “leaky” – that is, overnight interest rates might trade below the floor as banks charge an intermediation spread when borrowing reserves from non-banks that cannot directly store funds with the central bank.[18]
The bargaining power of non-banks can be increased by giving them access to the central banks’ balance sheet. This is what the Federal Reserve has achieved by establishing the overnight reverse repo facility (ON RRP) which remunerates cash held by selected non-banks at rates slightly below the one paid to banks. This facility therefore sets a second floor on money market rates, reducing their volatility.[19]
Operating a floor system like that of the Federal Reserve has three key benefits: first, it maintains a higher level of safe assets in the financial system; second, it is operationally simple, especially in a context where it may be hard to accurately forecast the demand for reserves; and third, it can ensure instrument robustness – that is, it can cater for large changes in the supply of reserves without diluting the interest rate signal.[20]
The degree of rate controllability under this framework depends, however, on a number of structural features of the economy. These features, in turn, raise trade-offs, which may be larger in the euro area than elsewhere.
One trade-off arises when central banks expand their balance sheets.
For example, the large increase in reserves in the wake of the PEPP and TLTROs has made the floor in the euro area more and more leaky, with the euro area’s benchmark interest rate, €STR, increasingly decoupling from the DFR (Slide 13).
In these circumstances, interest rate control could be improved by broadening access to the deposit facility, in ways similar to the ON RRP. Doing so could, however, affect the calculation of benchmark rates in the euro area.
An ample reserve system disintermediates the unsecured money market, so that the computation of €STR heavily relies on banks’ trading with market participants who have no access to the Eurosystem’s balance sheet.
At the end of last year, for example, borrowing from non-banks accounted for nearly 90% of all unsecured money market transactions (Slide 14). We would therefore need to find ways to safeguard continued robustness of €STR, while, at the same time, avoiding destabilising shifts in funds between banks and non-banks which could occur when broadening the access to our balance sheet.
A second trade-off arises when the supply of reserves declines.
Because the distribution of excess liquidity is often highly uneven across banks, reserve scarcity in corners of the financial system might put upward pressure on interest rates even at high levels of aggregate excess reserves.
In the euro area, for example, 25 banks alone currently hold over 40% of excess liquidity, with little changes over time (Slide 15, left-hand side). Moreover, excess liquidity tends to be concentrated in countries that are financial centres (Slide 15, right-hand side).
The uneven distribution of reserves within the system, together with the large uncertainty about banks’ underlying liquidity preferences, imply that central banks may have to keep a significant buffer of excess reserves in the financial system to avoid unwarranted interest rate volatility.
To provide ample reserves in this framework, the central bank is required, by and large, to maintain a significant outright “structural” bond portfolio. The Fed’s approach is therefore called a “supply-driven” floor system.
It constrains the choices of the central bank as to how to provide the reserves required to effectively steer overnight rates towards the floor. An attempt to allow banks to choose their desired level of reserves, using credit operations, could risk undersupplying the system as a whole, that is leaving it without the required volume of excess reserves.
In principle, policymakers are free to choose the broad characteristics of such a structural bond portfolio. For example, central banks could adjust the asset composition according to their secondary objectives, such as alignment with the Paris Agreement.[21]
Moreover, the average weighted maturity could be kept short to limit the impact of the portfolio on the monetary policy stance or to reduce central banks’ exposure to duration risk.
In the euro area, however, there are two additional considerations relevant for the assessment of whether a large bond portfolio is desirable or not.
One is that the lack of a consolidated public sector balance sheet raises more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member states. These concerns may potentially undermine the credibility and independence of the central bank.
If central banks need to raise interest rates sharply to protect price stability, this implies significant risk exposures for central banks and may have implications for government budgets.[22]In addition, large central bank’s sovereign bond holdings may distort the price information of underlying risks in the euro area.
Second, a large bond portfolio may affect liquidity conditions in financial markets.
In recent years, the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets has contributed to a significant “scarcity premium” that market participants must pay to obtain bonds bought under our asset purchase programmes (Slide 16, left-hand side).
Such scarcity effects can put the smooth functioning of financial markets at risk, especially when the demand for safe assets increases in periods of stress. These effects tend to be larger in the euro area than in the United States, given the euro area’s substantially lower volume of outstanding highly-rated and liquid bonds (Slide 16, right-hand side).
Central banks have tools to partly alleviate such distortionary effects. The Eurosystem’s securities lending facility, for example, channels bonds bought under our purchase programmes back into the market, improving liquidity.
But the larger the portfolio, the less likely it is that liquidity conditions remain unaffected. This could risk undermining our obligation to act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy where prices and quantities are determined by competitive market forces.[23]
The second approach has the potential to alleviate some of these trade-offs by allowing banks themselves to determine the amount of liquidity they want to hold.
This is broadly the approach the Bank of England first announced in 2019 and implemented in 2022.[24]
Under this approach, the central bank offers regular collateralised lending operations to ensure that any shortfall in banks' demand for reserves is replenished as quantitative tightening proceeds (Slide 17). That is why the Bank of England’s approach is referred to as a “demand-driven” floor system.
In doing so, the Bank of England can unwind its bond holdings without needing to know banks’ demand for excess reserves, nor the point at which the supply curve will start to cross the steep part of the demand curve.
The Bank of England currently offers reserves through short-term repo operations at the same rate that it pays to banks depositing reserves. Using the same rate for providing and remunerating reserves ensures that money market rates will trade closely to the policy rate at every level of excess reserves.
By its nature, such a system shares some of the benefits and costs of a supply-driven framework.
While it is operationally simple and robust to large changes in reserves, it may in some market structures also be prone to a leaky floor when excess reserves expand measurably in response to asset purchases or long-term credit operations.[25]
In addition, a demand-driven framework has two specific characteristics.
One is that its success in steering interest rates critically depends on banks’ willingness to regularly tap the lending operations as and when they begin to experience shortfalls relative to their reserves demand. Stigma may prevent banks from borrowing the amount needed to stabilise interest rates at the intended level.
In the United Kingdom, this risk has been tackled in three ways: first, through non-penal pricing; second, by communicating clearly that this is a business-as-usual monetary policy operation; and third, through a clear statement from the Prudential Regulation Authority that it would judge usage of the facility to be routine participation in money markets.
A second characteristic is a potential “coordination” problem: individually, banks may have incentives to be economical in their borrowing of reserves, which could expose them to unexpected liquidity shocks in-between liquidity providing operations.
So, in the absence of an efficient interbank market, there must be alternative facilities for banks to source liquidity at short notice should they need it. The Bank of England offers a range of liquidity facilities which allow firms to access reliable supplies of liquidity at a predictable cost.
Provided these issues can be resolved, the Bank of England’s approach has a number of benefits that may be particularly relevant for a large and heterogeneous currency area like the euro area.
One is that it may provide better insurance against potential fragmentation shocks.
Under a demand-driven framework, the distribution of reserves would be expected to be more even than in a supply-driven floor system, where excess reserves are often very concentrated (Slide 15). A more balanced reserve distribution could strengthen the resilience of the currency union.
A second benefit of a demand-driven framework is that it offers more flexibility on how the central bank provides reserves: because only themarginalunit of reserves to the banking system must be supplied via credit operations, the central bank may still choose to hold an outright bond portfolio, for example to satisfy the economy’s structural liquidity needs.
This portfolio could be appreciably smaller than what may be required to steer interest rates in a supply-driven framework. It could nevertheless be useful in reducing the operational burden and in avoiding encumbering large volumes of collateral.[26]
A third benefit is that the Bank of England’s approach may potentially lead to a leaner balance sheet depending on banks’ demand for reserves, which will depend, among other things, on two factors.
One is central banks’ collateral framework: all else being equal, the easier it is for counterparties to turn non-HQLA into highly liquid reserves, the larger the central bank’s balance sheet will be.
The other factor is the relative return on reserves. For a long time, reserves in the euro area have been an attractive option for complying with HQLA requirements. They persistently generated higher returns than safe and liquid bonds (Slide 18).
The rise in policy rates has made the relative returns on reserves much more volatile. In recent months, it was often more profitable for banks to hold marketable HQLA. This was also typically the norm when excess reserves were scarce.
A final and important benefit of a demand-driven framework is that it allows the central bank to gradually learn about banks’ underlying liquidity preferences.
This offers some flexibility for adjustment in the future. For example, although the Bank of England currently operates a floor framework, this is not a necessary feature for the success of a demand-driven system.
Sveriges Riksbank, for example, operates in a narrow corridor system where the lending rate and the deposit facility rate are set at a spread of 10 basis points above and below the policy rate. This spread was chosen to encourage counterparties to find market solutions for their funding needs rather than making recourse to the central bank.[27]
If the corridor is sufficiently narrow, the implied rate volatility from fluctuations in aggregate excess reserves may not be a first-order concern. Indeed, the experience of the Eurosystem in 2014, when excess liquidity was declining, suggests that even relatively large fluctuations in overnight rates might not affect broader policy transmission (Slide 19).
Conclusion
To conclude, my remarks today have highlighted that the decision which policy implementation framework the ECB should choose for the future involves many complex issues. Ultimately, our obligation to act in line with the principle of an open market economy implies that, in the steady state,the size of our balance sheet should only be as large as necessary to ensure sufficient liquidity provision and effectively steer short-term interest rates towards levels that are consistent with price stability over the medium term.
Thank you."

Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Foreign Bankers’ Association (FBA) 30th anniversary
Amsterdam, 27 March 2023
Thank you for inviting me to the FBA’s 30th anniversary event. As I speak to you today, the global financial system is going through turbulent weeks. In the confluence of multiple challenges, often the very urgent trumps the similarly vitally important. It is tempting and frankly quite human to focus the attention on the most immediately pressing challenges.
Climate-related and environmental (C&E) financial risks might thus not seem the most obvious topic for a keynote speech at this moment.However, exactly one week ago the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Synthesis Report, according to which temperatures have already risen to 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This worrisome observation reminds us that addressing the increasing risks from the ongoing climate and environment crises is both highly urgent and vitally important.
This is the reason why in this keynote I want to stress that “we have no time to lose regarding the sustainable transformation”; that we need to “step up the global ambition to meet the Paris Agreement goals”; that our world needs “more ambition to accelerate the change towards a net-zero economy”; and that “financial institutions can and must play a key role in driving the world towards net-zero carbon emissions”. I want to talk about the importance of “aligning credit portfolios with the objectives of the Paris Agreement” and “managing climate-related risks as a priority action”.
These words don’t beat around the bush. These words express clear ambitions. These words cut to the heart of the matter.
However, these words did not come from the ECB, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) or the IPCC.
These areyourwords.
And by this, I mean literal quotes from the CEOs of banks that have signed the Net-Zero Banking Alliance – a group committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. Most of these banks are also members of the FBA. These words show that you want to play a pivotal role in the transition to net zero. These words articulate your ambition to make climate-related and environmental considerations a key pillar of your strategy.
In this keynote speech, I would like to give you an update on where banks under ECB supervision currently stand relative to their stated ambitions, and what still needs to be done to adequately address C&E risks from a prudential point of view. But first, a few words about regulators and supervisors. Just as it is the case for banks, a broad global consensus has also emerged in our community on the need to make C&E considerations an integral part of our DNA.
Evolving international supervisory consensus regarding C&E risks
Let me first very briefly revisit the simple guiding principle driving prudential regulators around the globe: ensuring that no material risks are left unaddressed. It is enshrined in the BCBS core principles and has been a legal requirement for decades. According to this principle, banks must identify and adequately manage the risks they are exposed to. Just as for any other material source of risk, this also holds true for C&E risks.
To be clear, it is not for us as supervisors to tell banks how green their lending policies must be. However, we insist that not taking into account the transition towards a more sustainable economy is no longer compatible with sound risk management. To this end, the ECB has strongly supported a rapidly growing global coalition in acknowledging that C&E risks form an integral part of our mandate. A key motivation to address this risk at the global level was to create a level playing field for banks to tackle what everyone agrees is a material source of financial risk.
To ensure that European banks are indeed in a position to manage C&E risks, as early as in 2020 the ECB published a guide on C&E risks[1]for banks. The guide demonstrated the ECB’s commitment to making the financial system more resilient to these risks. It set out 13 supervisory expectations for how the banks under our supervision should integrate C&E risks into their business models and strategies, governance and risk appetite to increase the resilience of their portfolios. In doing so, we were moving very much in lockstep with the global principles for supervising C&E risks, building on the prevailing best practices identified by the globalNetwork of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System(NGFS).
During the two years following the publication of the ECB supervisory expectations, we conducted several supervisory exercises on banks’ approaches to managing these risks. We started with banks’ self-assessments in 2021, followed by a climate stress test and thematic review of C&E risks in 2022. Last year’s supervisory exercises were stepping stones to what I would call an immersive supervisory approach[2]which is aimed at holistically integrating C&E risks into all parts of the supervisory dialogue with banks.
Many examples from around the globe show that prudential regulators and supervisors have embarked on this immersive supervisory approach. For instance, as early as 2019 the Bank of England published its climate-related supervisory expectations addressed to banks and insurers.[3]In 2020 the Philippines gave banks three years to develop transition plans with specific timelines to implement board-approved sustainability principles into their governance and risk management. In the United States earlier this year the Federal Reserve launched a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise assessing banks’ resilience to a set of forward-looking scenarios. Earlier this month, the Canadian financial regulator OSFI released final guidelines outlining how financial firms should manage climate-related risks. Also, the NGFS now brings together 121 members from around the globe. This shows that more and more authorities are committed to ensuring the sound management of climate-related risks by the banks they supervise.
Based on this global convergence of supervisory expectations, I am always puzzled whenever I hear that Europe is allegedly too ambitious in tackling C&E risks. The pace at which we are moving is very much in lockstep with our global peers.
Thanks to the BCBS’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks, which I co-chair with Kevin Stiroh from the US Federal Reserve, we took steps in converging the plethora of international expectations into an initial formal consensus. As a result, there is progress on all three pillars of the Basel Framework for the prudential regulation of banks.
For instance, in June 2022 the BCBS published the Pillar 2 principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks[4], and it expects implementation as soon as possible. To ensure this, the BCBS made the monitoring of progress across jurisdictions a key element of its 2023-24 work programme. This is good news since this global approach ensures a level playing field for a source of risk that everyone agrees is material to them.
Moreover, as a first step on Pillar 1, the BCBS has recently published a set of frequently asked questions to clarify how climate-related financial risks may be captured in the existing Pillar 1 framework. The BCBS’s guidance tells banks how they can already consider material climate-related risks in their regulatory capital. For instance, when determining the property value of real estate, banks may consider climate-related impacts. In Europe, discussions on possible changes to the Pillar 1 framework will take place on the basis of the technical analysis being performed by the European Banking Authority. I welcome this approach as it ensures that the prudential framework remains risk based.
In the field of disclosures, I am similarly pleased to see a consolidation of various international initiatives at the Basel level. Building on the extensive work that has already been done in various fora, the BCBS has started developing high-quality and globally consistent “Pillar 3” climate-related disclosure requirements. The BCBS will issue a consultation paper on the proposed framework by the end of this year. This is a welcome step given that banks’ own shareholders are becoming increasingly demanding in this field, especially in banks that have publicly committed to achieving net-zero targets.
In the context of the international regulatory advancements I have just outlined, I would like to reassure you that the ECB’s commitment to follow a risk-based approach to C&E risks will remain strong in the future too.
Together with you, the internationally active banks, we can ensure that the same level of ambition in tackling C&E risks is kept around the world. I expect the international banking community to raise a loud voice in the various international fora. A voice that advocates and supports an ambitious level playing field on C&E risk management. A voice I have already heard you use on many occasions, in many public statements. For instance, one bank explicitly mentions in its annual report that being profitable in the long term goes hand in hand with environmental performance. Another bank talks of its strong commitment to being a key partner to clients on their path to a more climate-friendly economy. Your own statements clearly demonstrate that banks do not lack ambition. But what banks need to ensure now is that this ambition is also translated into practice. This is the only way to remain sound in a net-zero carbon future.
The current state of banks’ C&E risk management
After having revisited the broad regulatory consensus, let me now reflect on where the banks under ECB supervision currently stand in integrating C&E risks into their strategy and risk management. I will illustrate this using takeaways from the two supervisory exercises conducted by the ECB in 2022: a climate stress test and thematic review of C&E risks. Jointly, these exercises gave us a full picture of how banks are performing relative to our supervisory expectations.
On aggregate the results are mixed. We see the glass filling up slowly, but it is not yet even half full. This is both good and bad news: good news because there is progress compared with where banks were some years ago; bad news because banks are still a long way from where they need to be.
On the positive side, banks have made meaningful progress in accounting for and addressing C&E risks. For instance, most banks acknowledge the materiality of these risks in their portfolios. This means that there is broad consensus among banks that C&E risks are a material source of financial risk and that they are impossible to evade. As a result, banks have made progress in integrating C&E risks into their risk management processes, which is not an easy task. It is thanks to thousands of C&E risk experts working very hard in banks all over Europe, from Lisbon to Helsinki, from Dublin to Athens, that this progress has been made.
However, despite the improvements, we have concluded that overall risk management capabilities are still insufficient. In other words, there is still a material gap between where banks currently stand and our supervisory expectations. Let me illustrate this with three examples.
First, in the climate stress test we found that three in five banks still do not have a climate stress testing framework in place. Among the banks that do, we found that most do not ensure independence between the development and validation functions of the stress testing framework.
Second, the thematic review showed that virtually all banks have blind spots in the identification of C&E risks. One such blind spot is the lack of consideration of the physical risks posed by the climate and environmental crises. For example, even though water stress is on the rise and already affects 30% of Europeans in an average year, less than one-third of banks consider this risk driver in their strategic risk impact assessments.
Third, there are broader environmental risks that go beyond purely climate-related risks that banks still focus too little on. We are currently observing an unprecedented decline of natural ecosystems and their vital services, with 75% of land surface and 66% of ocean ecosystems damaged, degraded or modified.[5]This is also concerning economically given that more than half of global GDP depends on nature.[6]Therefore, nature degradation for example through biodiversity loss is also emerging as a material source of financial risk. Our supervisory expectations explicitly apply to the management of both climate-related and environmental risks, both of which are a material source of financial risk. However, many banks have so far come up with only a high-level description of the general impact on vulnerable sectors, like agriculture, mining and manufacturing, and have yet to perform adequate materiality assessments.
As the two supervisory exercises demonstrated, for the glass to become full – that is complying with our supervisory expectations – banks must considerably increase the pace of progress. And I will now outline how this can be done.
The way ahead for banks and supervisors
In line with the guiding principle that no material risk should remain unaddressed, we expect all banks under our supervision to be fully aligned with our expectations by the end of 2024 at the latest. This clear implementation deadline also ensures a level playing field for all banks in the banking union. In other words, after 2024, a limbo of identifying a risk as material but not adequately addressing it will no longer be tolerated.
However, we are mindful of the challenges banks may face in aligning with our supervisory expectations. To smooth the transition further, we have also set some intermediate deadlines for banks to reach specific milestones. For example, by the end of March 2023 we expect all banks to have a sound and comprehensive materiality assessment and business environment scan in place. This means that banks must make an explicit judgement on the impact of C&E risks through various transmission channels in the short, medium and long term across their portfolios. Insufficiently documenting the non-materiality of certain portfolios will no longer be acceptable.
Let me insist that by now all key ingredients to make C&E risks an integral part of banks’ strategy and risk management are well known. But you – the banks – are in the lead when it comes to translating ambitions into practice by designing and implementing tools to adequately manage these risks. One of the silver linings of our supervisory exercises last year is that we have published the good practices observed in both the climate stress test[7]and the thematic review[8].
To give a telling example, in the area of governance some front runners have already integrated C&E risks into the work of the management body. For example, in one bank the management body approves the environmental strategy and risk management framework and oversees their implementation in day-to-day processes. It is supported in this work by a dedicated committee, most of whose members are independent directors and bring the appropriate level of knowledge and experience of C&E risks.
Another good practice can be seen in the use of transition planning tools aimed at managing the risks of the transition. This involves using scientific pathways to assess the alignment of banks’ portfolios with the Paris Agreement and designing clear and actionable plans to address observed misalignments.
With these good practices, banks now have access to very practical suggestions on how to accelerate progress. Knowing that no “one-size-fits-all” approach exists, let me assure you that, as part of the ongoing supervisory dialogue, our supervisory teams are there to discuss specific implementation challenges with each bank
Finally, I would like to stress that we will closely monitor banks’ progress with respect to the deadlines, and, if necessary, we will use all measures in our toolkit to ensure compliance with our expectations. These include imposing periodic penalty payments and setting Pillar 2 capital requirements as part of the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Over the last couple of years, a global consensus has emerged among regulators, supervisors and banks around the need to tackle the financial risks stemming from ongoing climate and environmental crises.
As underlined by the latest worrisome observations from last week’s IPCC report, it is both highly urgent and vitally important for banks to be able to identify and manage C&E risks.
2023 is a crucial year for translating ambitions into sound internal practices, for which substantial progress is needed.
I hope I can count on your full commitment so that by the end of 2024 we can conclude that banks are “managing climate-related risks as a priority”, as articulated by one of your peers that signed the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. This would, of course, not be the end of the journey, as C&E risks, like any other mainstream risk, demand continuous attention and adaptation. But it would be a crucial step to making the banking system resilient to the twin climate and environmental crises, an urgent and vitally important imperative if ever there was one."

Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a panel on “Global shocks, policy spillovers and geo-strategic risks: how to coordinate policies” at The ECB and its Watchers XXIII Conference
Frankfurt am Main, 22 March 2023
We are still going through a sequence of global shocks that are disrupting economies around the world. In just three years we have seen a pandemic, severe supply chain disruptions, a war, an energy crisis and now tensions in banking markets.
The resulting swings in activity and prices have presented policymakers with the challenge of identifying turning points in their underlying dynamics at a time of disruption in the economy and the financial sector. Inevitably, we need to navigate between the risk of underreacting – which could prolong the inflationary effects of these shocks – and that of overreacting, which could turn volatility into instability.
There are no simple solutions to these complex problems.
We need to adapt our policies to the overlapping effects of the shocks, to geopolitical developments, to the risk of financial amplification and to spillovers from other jurisdictions.
Three principles can help guide our monetary policy decisions in this context.
First, given the prevailing uncertainty and the ground we have already covered in tightening our policy, we must remain fully data-dependent and avoid pre-committing to any specific policy path. We should be guided by our reaction function, taking stock of inflation developments, underlying inflation dynamics and the strength of monetary policy transmission, also given the possible risks for the medium term outlook stemming from both the real economy and the financial sector.[1]This way we can ensure that we calibrate our measures in the light of the incoming information.[2]
Second, we need to monitor the effects of our measures and the way our different instruments interact with each other. In particular, we should continuously assess the combined effect of raising rates and reducing the size of our balance sheet.[3]The experience of other jurisdictions suggests that abrupt adjustments could make it more difficult for investors to adapt to evolving market conditions.
We need to maintain our disinflationary stance until we see convincing signs that inflation is returning to our target, in line with the “separation principle”: delivering the appropriate policy stance should not come at the cost of impairing its transmission.
And third: given the global nature of the shocks we are facing, we need to consider how they are transmitted across markets and economies as well as the potentialspilloversfrom policies adopted abroad. But we should remain focused on our primary mandate of ensuring price stability in the euro area, without being overly conditioned by other jurisdictions.[4]
I will start by illustrating the global shocks and the uncertainty they create. I will then turn to the policy response to these shocks and their spillovers across jurisdictions. And I will outline what this means for our monetary policy in the current environment.
Global shocks and uncertainty
Over the past three years we have faced considerable uncertainty from both domestic and global shocks, complicating the policy diagnosis and increasing the risks of either underreacting or overreacting.
A major source of uncertainty surrounding both inflation and economic activity relates to the pass-through of global shocks and their unwinding. For example, the unprecedented sequence of domestic and global shocks makes it difficult to distinguish supply-demand imbalances triggered by the pandemic and the energy crisis from persistent, self-sustained inflationary dynamics.
The reopening of the economy after the pandemic gave a sudden boost to demand (Chart 1) at a time when supply disruptions had not yet been resolved, leading to persistent bottlenecks. Firms reacted by building up inventories and hoarding labour, fuelling inflationary pressures. As a result, both demand and supply contributed to inflation in 2022.
The boost to activity from the reopening is now fading. Supply bottlenecks have largely faded out[5](Chart 2) and firms are starting to run down their inventories (Chart 3). This should dampen price pressures.
The energy crisis has had similar effects.[6]The sharp increase in wholesale energy and commodity prices has raised not only energy and food inflation but also – indirectly – core goods and services inflation (Chart 4).
These effects are starting to be reabsorbed. Lower energy and commodity prices have translated into lower energy inflation (Chart 5). And they should eventually pass through to food and core inflation – consistent with the easing in pipeline price pressures (Chart 6). This is compressing medium-term consumer inflation expectations[7], and might temper catch-up wage demands. But how quickly these effects will be reflected in the inflation data is uncertain. And concerns about inflation persistence[8]make projecting core inflation particularly challenging.
The unwinding of inflationary pressures has triggered concerns about the risk of second-round effects in the form of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations or a wage-price spiral, especially in view of the tight labour market conditions in advanced economies (Chart 7).[9]
In the euro area, medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored at our target. This reflects the ECB’s clear commitment to stamp out inflation. As President Lagarde stated this morning, “the public can be certain about one thing: we will deliver price stability, and bringing inflation back to 2% over the medium term is non-negotiable.”[10]
Robust wage growth over the next three years is also consistent with our projections, which indicate that inflation will gradually fall to around 3% by the end of 2023 and around 2% by the middle of 2025.
The risk is rather that wage and price-setting dynamics could make high inflation stickier and eventually feed into inflation expectations. Wages are still accelerating, and we cannot rule out a scenario in which stronger and persistent wage increases take hold. This risk needs to be closely monitored.
Opportunistic behaviour by firms could also delay the fall in core inflation. In fact, unit profits contributed to more than half of domestic price pressures in the last quarter of 2022 (Chart 8).[11]In some industries, profits are increasing strongly (Chart 9) and retail prices are rising rapidly, in spite of the fact that wholesale prices have been decreasing for some time. This suggests that some producers have been exploiting the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation[12]and supply-demand mismatches[13]to increase their margins, raising prices beyond what was necessary to absorb cost increases. We should monitor the risk that a profit-price spiral could make core inflation stickier.
Looking ahead, a normalisation of profits would help bring down core inflation and reduce the risk of second-round effects, as wage demands could be accommodated without leading to an increase in prices in response.
Uncertainty about global supply and demand conditions is still high – and is now exacerbated by the financial tensions that have recently emerged.
Demand is showing signs of weakness in both the United States and the euro area.[14]
In China, the end of zero-COVID policies has been followed by a downturn and then a rebound, which could still be slowed down by headwinds emanating from the property market. The reopening will have an ambiguous overall effect on global inflation: it could dampen prices in sectors where China is a net exporter – such as goods – and increase prices in sectors where it is a net importer, such as commodities.[15]
The global policy response and its spillovers
A second source of uncertainty relates to the global policy responses to the shocks, and the spillovers from these responses.
We have already seen clear examples of these spillovers. For instance, the outsized fiscal stimulus implemented in the United States in response to the pandemic boosted the demand for durable goods (Chart 10) but led to a negative supply shock in other countries.[16]In the euro area, this supply shock contributed to pushing up inflation and hit the economy at an early stage of its recovery.[17]
We are now facing a simultaneous and rapid global tightening of financing conditions (Charts 11), which is creating financial and policy spillovers (Chart 12). For example, monetary tightening in the United States is also resulting in tighter financing conditions[18]in other jurisdictions, including the euro area.[19]This adds to the risk of overtightening if central banks do not factor in the feedback loops they create.[20]
In the euro area, the effects of monetary tightening are already visible, although they are only expected to fully materialise in the coming months due to the usual lag in the transmission of monetary policy. The monetary aggregates M1 and M3 are slowing down rapidly. In real terms their growth rates are in negative territory and at historic lows, below the levels of 2008 and 2011 (Chart 13).[21]Bank credit is also decelerating rapidly (Chart 14). As a result, it is declining as a share of GDP – faster, in fact, than in previous tightening episodes – and markets expect it to decline significantly further this year (Chart 15). These developments are largely related to our policy normalisation. But the size and the speed of the adjustment indicate that the transmission of our monetary policy to the economy may have become stronger.
The global tightening may also be amplified by the recent financial tensions in global banking markets. Aside from their impact on confidence, these tensions will make banks more sensitive to deposit outflows, inducing them to transfer the rate hikes more rapidly – and to a greater extent – to their customers on both sides of the balance sheet. For a while, banks may also become more prudent about lending and decide to retain cash as a precautionary measure. In the euro area, our bank lending survey[22]was already pointing to a tightening of lending standards for firms and households before the recent tensions, and this tightening may aggravate the drop in credit growth in the coming months.
In addition, major central banks have been simultaneously raising rates and reducing the supply of liquidity through quantitative tightening policies. This could make the policy adjustment bumpier. There is no reliable experience we can draw on to examine the combined effects of rate hikes and quantitative tightening. It is hard to assess how a contraction of the balance sheet of the central bank affects financial markets – especially if it happens in conjunction with an abrupt increase in interest rates.[23]The liability-driven investment crisis in the United Kingdom and the crisis of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States suggest that sudden adjustments may have an impact on the transmission of monetary policy and even give rise to severe financial tensions.[24]
In the current context, weakening growth prospects and heightened uncertainty may lead investors to move from risky assets to risk-free assets. And when the supply of liquidity is contracting quickly, this may spur a “dash for cash”, reinforcing the effects of the sharp increase in policy rates and exacerbating financial vulnerabilities. In fact, in the United States, high quality liquid assets are unusually offering higher returns than risky assets (Chart 16) at a time when liquidity is being withdrawn from the system.
As available liquidity shrinks, both in aggregate and for most banks, the supply of lending could also contract rapidly. Estimates by ECB staff suggest that banks with lower excess liquidity are more likely to reduce their supply of credit in response to policy rate hikes, and the increase in their lending rates is likely to be larger (Chart 17).
Implications for the ECB’s monetary policy
So how should monetary policy operate in an environment characterised by high uncertainty, strong spillovers and financial vulnerabilities?
First, monetary policy must remain fully adaptable to changing developments, given the prevailing uncertainty, the lags with which it operates and the risk of sudden financial tensions. This requires a data-dependent approach that does not prejudge future policy decisions and that reflects the risks on both sides.
Second, our tightening must be calibrated prudently. This is because it is already having a strong impact on financing conditions and because we want to avoid undesirable financial volatility. And this prudent approach holds truer still as our policy rates move more firmly into restrictive territory, inflationary forces ease and the risks to the inflation outlook become balanced. At times like this, abrupt policy moves are not necessary.[25]
Third, in order to avoid financial tensions which could hamper our disinflationary policies, we should rely on our policy rate as the key instrument to steer our stance and we should be measured and predictable in the normalisation of our balance sheet. We should continuously monitor investors’ exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk and carefully analyse the impact that the decline in liquidity may have on the supply of credit.
We must stand ready to intervene in a timely manner to counter possible market dysfunctions. We have the instruments to adjust the provision of liquidity and ease collateral conditions as necessary, in line with what we have done during the pandemic. And we need to remain committed to our three lines of defence against financial fragmentation within the euro area.[26]
Finally, all policymakers should be tackling inflation on all fronts. It is not a task for central bankers alone. Thanks to public intervention, we had an unusual recession – one with high profits. This means that firms have the buffers to absorb a catch-up in labour costs without increasing prices in response, also in view of the fall in the cost of other inputs, like energy.
Persistently opportunistic profits should not put a dampener on disinflation. Profiteering strategies that increase inflation and the risk of second-round effects would trigger a monetary policy reaction. But other authorities should also intervene. The appropriate response to excess corporate profits is not more fiscal support to compensate consumers for high prices of goods and services. Rather, it is to intervene to prevent any abuse of market power.
Let me now turn to how monetary policy should address spillovers.
We must take into account all the relevant information when taking decisions, and that includes developments outside the euro area. Given the global nature of the shocks we are facing, we need to consider how they are transmitted across markets and economies, alongside the potentialspilloversfrom the policy response to those shocks. This is what we have done. And in response to tensions in international funding markets, we have worked with other major central banks to enhance the provision of US dollar liquidity via our standing liquidity swap line arrangements.[27]
At the same time, we need to tailor our policy response to the outlook for the euro area and avoid passively importing financing conditions from abroad through policy spillovers to interest rate expectations and long-term interest rates. We have the necessary autonomy to steer financing conditions in a way that reflects the differences between the euro area and other jurisdictions.[28]
We can reconcile these two objectives – factoring in spillovers but tailoring our policy to domestic conditions – if we calibrate our policy appropriately and communicate our reaction function clearly.
Our measures need to be calibrated in such a way that they achieve the appropriate domestic stance. To use a metaphor – if outside temperatures start falling after a period of hot weather, we have less need for air conditioning because temperatures inside will gradually cool, too. If we then apply this approach to our current situation, when calibrating our measures we should consider the restrictive impulse coming from the global tightening and from the vulnerabilities that are emerging in the financial sector abroad.
The clarity of our communication is also crucial, especially in view of the current financial tensions. In order to communicate our policy intentions clearly and consistently at a time when we must remain data-dependent and adapt to new developments, we need to set out a clear reaction function and stick to it.[29]Accordingly, in our latest monetary policy statement we emphasised that “The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to our policy rate decisions, which will be determined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.”[30]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
A string of shocks has created uncertainty for economies around the world. While the effects of some of these shocks are starting to unwind, it may be some time yet before we see volatility in activity and prices subside, and a new equilibrium settle in.
Notably, my remarks today have focused on the current economic situation. But we may well see longer-lasting changes to economic structures as supply chains are reconfigured to increase resilience to global shocks and align with shifting geopolitical strategies.
In the meantime, monetary policy must perform a difficult balancing act.
Faced with an exceptionally complex environment, we need to acknowledge the uncertainty prevailing in the economy. And we need to continuously assess the combined effect of our different policy instruments, the risks of non-linear effects and the spillovers from policies adopted elsewhere. This means our monetary policy should be data-dependent and adaptable. And it requires us to shape our communication on the basis of our monetary policy reaction function.
In a speech last month I summarised my thinking by saying that we do not want “to drive like crazy at night with our headlights turned off”.[31]The recent financial tensions have made this conviction even stronger."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at “The ECB and Its Watchers XXIII” conference
Frankfurt am Main, 22 March 2023
The euro area has been hit by an inflation shock, which is now working its way through the economy. While headline inflation is likely to decline steeply this year, driven by falling energy prices and easing supply bottlenecks, underlying inflation dynamics remain strong.
In such an environment, our ultimate goal is clear: we must – and we will – bring down inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner.
But to achieve this goal we need a robust strategy, which takes into account the high levels of uncertainty we are facing today. As John Maynard Keynes once observed, “it would be foolish, in forming our expectations, to attach great weight to matters which are very uncertain”.
In current conditions, a robust strategy calls for a data-dependent approach to making policy and a clear reaction function so that the public understands the sources of information that will be important to us.
To that end, our future policy path will be determined by three factors: our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
At the same time, I have made clear that there is no trade-off between price stability and financial stability. We have plenty of tools to provide liquidity support to the financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
In my remarks today, I will discuss our policy path so far and what lies ahead. And I will explain the reaction function that will govern our future rate decisions.
The path so far
Last year, inflation in the euro area surged strongly, and spread deeply, because it was driven by two types of shocks which hit the economy at the same time.
First, we underwent an unprecedented series of negative supply shocks caused by pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis. This significantly increased input costs for all sectors of the economy.
Second, we faced a positive demand shock caused by the reopening of the economy after the pandemic. That favourable demand environment allowed firms to pass rising input costs through to prices much faster and more strongly than in the past.[1]
Our policy stance was starting from highly accommodative levels, having been tailored to the very-low inflation environment of the past decade and the initial deflationary risks of the pandemic. So, we had to adjust, as quickly as possible, a stance that had become inadequate.
This initially placed important emphasis on signalling, i.e. demonstrating, through actions and commitments, that monetary policy would cover the necessary ground decisively.
That is why we put a great weight on the pace of our actions, hiking rates in large increments. And we also communicated a clear upward path for rates, so that the public could be confident that monetary policy was on an anti-inflationary path, and that rates would soon leave accommodative territory. In a sense, an emphasis on data dependence was less important because monetary policy had distance to cover across all scenarios.
But as the inflation outlook evolved, it became clear that a pure normalisation of policy – which would imply achieving a broadly neutral stance – would not suffice in itself. The combination of shocks had two effects – on distance and persistence – which warranted further policy action.
First, the shocks increased the distance of inflation from our target. Even though inflation has likely passed its peak, it is descending from very high levels, and it is projected to be too far above our target for too long. The longer inflation is too high, the greater the danger that it remains so.
Second, the shocks also increased the risk that above-target inflation becomes more persistent. In particular, price pressures have broadened and deepened. Measures of underlying inflation tracked by the ECB currently range between 4% and 8%.
In this setting, we needed to bring rates to sufficiently restrictive levels to dampen demand. And, in doing so, we could keep a firm grip on inflation expectations and ensure they remain anchored.
That is a key reason why we committed to raise interest rates significantly and at a steady pace over recent meetings – and why we decided last week that a further 50 basis point hike was necessary.
The policy path ahead
Now a sizeable policy adjustment is already behind us: since July last year we have raised interest rates by 350 basis points. However, inflation is still high, and uncertainty around its path ahead has increased. This makes a robust strategy going forward essential.
Such a strategy has three elements.
First, with high uncertainty, it is even more important that the rate path is data-dependent. This means, ex ante, that we are neither committed to raise further nor are we finished with hiking rates. Indeed, as I explained last week, if the baseline scenario in our most recent projections is confirmed, we will still have ground to cover to make sure that inflation pressures are stamped out.
Second, while the European banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions, in view of recent financial market volatility, we are ready to act and provide liquidity support to the financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
But it should be clear that there is no trade-off between price stability and financial stability. As we have proven many times, we are able to set the appropriate policy stance to control inflation and at the same time use other instruments to address risks to monetary policy transmission.
We did this when we decided to use reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme more flexibly, and when we agreed on the transmission protection instrument. These programmes ensured that rate normalisation proceeded smoothly.
The third element of a robust strategy is a clear reaction function. At our last meeting, we clarified our reaction function and the sources of information that will be important to us. The future calibration of the rate path will be determined by – and will require continuous monitoring of – three key inputs, and this is what I will explain now.
The inflation outlook
The first input is our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data. This will be informed primarily by our staff inflation projections.
Monetary policy must be forward-looking, given the lags with which our policy works. And the staff inflation projections are the best mechanism for distilling incoming economic and financial data into a comprehensive picture of medium-term inflation dynamics. The future rate path will depend on whether we see inflation converging durably to our target in our forecasts, and the level of confidence we have in this convergence as captured by the balance of risks.
Our latest forecasts see headline inflation at 2.1% in 2025 and core inflation at 2.2%, which is a downward revision compared with our last projection round in December. But the confidence band around these forecasts is now unusually wide.
As the cut-off date for the projection round was in early March, the forecasts do not incorporate the effects of the recent financial market tensions. Those tensions have added new downside risks and have made the risk assessment blurrier. More generally, many of the assumptions in the projections, such as those on fiscal policies and energy and food prices, are volatile. This implies additional uncertainty around the baseline for both growth and inflation.
Some of this uncertainty will recede as the fallout from recent events in financial markets becomes clearer. But faced with overlapping shocks and shifting geopolitics, the level of uncertainty will most likely remain high. To confirm the outlook in our projections over time, we therefore also need to look at additional indicators that can be observed in real time.
Underlying inflation
To that end, the second input we will be drawing on is the dynamics of underlying inflation.
Underlying inflation is not a policy target, but measures of underlying inflation can serve as a complementary cross-check of our forecasting process. Underlying inflation is typically quite inertial and therefore gives us an indication about the persistence of inflation into the medium term. We will be looking to see a sustained downward turn in underlying inflation measures to be confident that the inflation path will converge to our target in the medium term.
So far, we do not see clear evidence that underlying inflation is trending downwards. In fact, we see two forces pushing underlying inflation in different directions.
To the one side, falling energy prices are weakening a key driver of underlying inflation pressures. Imported energy prices have played a central role in pushing up inflation for all economic sectors, given the huge energy shock we have faced. This is why measures of underlying inflation that capture the more persistent effects of energy costs are already showing a decline.[2]
To the other side, increasing domestic price pressures could offset some of this disinflationary impulse. Measures of underlying inflation that capture items sensitive to the business cycle – such as Supercore[3]– or items with low import content are still strengthening. If this continues and aggregate demand picks up from its current compressed levels, we could see a handover from imported to domestic price pressures that keeps overall price pressures high.
The key issue in determining which of these forces wins out will be developments in wages.
The euro area has suffered a large terms-of-trade loss owing to rising energy prices, the cost of which must ultimately be shared between firms and workers. And it is important that there is fair burden sharing between them, with both accepting that they cannot fully recover the income that the euro area has paid to the rest of the world and the ensuing loss of output.
So far, real wages have decreased substantially, while firms’ profit margins have expanded in many sectors. But the labour market is quite tight, labour shortages are increasing, and the terms-of-trade shock has largely reversed. This is leading workers to use their bargaining power to recoup lost income.
For the seven countries covered by the ECB’s wage tracker,[4]collective bargaining during 2022 led to an aggregate wage rise of 4.7% for this year. This is already playing a stronger role in core inflation. While wage-sensitive items[5]contributed only around 0.5 percentage points to core inflation before the pandemic, that contribution has more than doubled in recent months.
If both workers and firms accept fair burden sharing, and stronger wage growth represents merely a rebalancing between labour and capital, then both wage and price pressures should diminish as this process plays out. But if both parties attempt to unilaterally minimise their losses, we could see a feedback mechanism between higher profit margins, wages and prices.
The risk of such a “tit-for-tat” dynamic is also heightened by the prospect that labour market tightness will linger.
Unlike other jurisdictions, labour participation in the euro area has grown robustly since last year[6], helping to address part of the soaring labour demand driven by reopening. But the pandemic has also led to a sharp increase in public employment[7], reducing the pool of labour available to the private sector. And how much further labour supply can expand overall will depend, among other things, on complex policy questions such as countries’ attitudes to immigration and childcare.
At the same time, the unemployment rate is at a historical low and, in some countries, it is so low that it will be increasingly difficult to recruit from the remaining pool of labour.
All this means that we could see a more prolonged cost-push shock coming from wage growth. This is unlikely to prevent goods disinflation, since wages represent only around 20% of direct input costs for manufacturing firms. But wages make up around 40% of direct input costs for services providers, and services inflation accounts for almost two-thirds of core inflation.
In parallel, firms’ profit margins continue to grow, in part because some are taking advantage of supply-demand imbalances to test consumer demand with large price increases – over and above their increase in costs. But in the absence of a persistent rise in market power[8], this can only continue insofar as demand remains resilient. Otherwise, firms will have to absorb cost increases in margins and price pressures will start to ease.
This is where the third input comes in that we will use to assess the rate path, which is the strength of the transmission of our policy measures in restricting demand.
Policy transmission
We saw a large contraction in domestic demand at the end of last year and the latest data, such as retail sales, suggest that consumption has not yet rebounded.But this has not stopped cost increases from passing through. Short-term measures of momentum in core inflation – for instance the three-month on three-month rate – actually increased in February.
There are two factors which could explain this apparent resilience.
The first is the atypical buffers for consumption that households have available in the current environment. They are still benefiting from sizeable fiscal policy support to shield them from rising energy prices, amounting to around €250 billion in 2022 and 2023, and they still have around €900 billion in excess savings built up during the pandemic.[9]
The second factor is the reduced sensitivity of the labour market to slowing growth, which is supporting labour income and households’ employment expectations. Faced with labour shortages, firms are responding to weaker demand first by hoarding labour – that is, by further reducing hours worked rather than by cutting jobs.
And now, with energy prices falling and wages rising, household disposable incomes are set to increase. This was reflected – before the recent financial market tensions arose – in our projections for a stronger recovery this year.
So, for inflationary pressures to ease, it is important that our monetary policy works robustly in the restrictive direction. And that process is only starting to take effect now.
The first leg of the monetary transmission process – from policy measures to financing and monetary conditions – is already having a substantial impact.The cost of borrowing is increasing steeply, and loan dynamics look to be contracting faster than during previous hiking cycles. Credit growth to firms has dropped markedly since the third quarter of last year.
We are also seeing a tightening of money, with annual M1 growth turning negative for the first time since the creation of the euro area − although this is also being driven by the shifting of funds from overnight to better-remunerated time deposits in the context of higher rates.
For the second leg of the transmission process – from tighter financing and monetary conditions to demand – there is currently more uncertainty. We know that the full effect of monetary policy on demand will only reveal itself over time. But both the strength and speed of this process could have changed.
Since the ECB last conducted a major hiking cycle, in the mid-2000s, the financial structure of the euro area has evolved.The share of variable-rate mortgages has fallen, slowing the transmission of interest rate increases into debt payments. Excess savings and the low pass-through to deposit rates might also weaken incentives for households to save more of their income in response to higher policy rates. These factors could mean a weaker pass-through to consumption.
At the same time, we have seen a very sudden shift from low-for-long rates to considerably higher levels – and this is already havingan impact on more interest-sensitive demand components like investment. Housing investment has been falling for the past three quarters and business investment also contracted at the end of last year. The greater role today played by sectors that rely on discounted future earnings, such as tech, could also make monetary transmission more powerful.
What we will have to monitor carefully in the weeks and months to come is whether there is a further strengthening of this pass-through. If, for example, banks start to apply a larger “intermediation wedge” – meaning that at any level of the base rate they demand a higher compensation for the perceived risk they are taking on when lending – then pass-through will become stronger.
So, we will be paying close attention to a range of indicators of credit availability and credit pricing, such as the monthly data on money and credit flows, our bank lending survey and our survey on access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises.
While more restrictive credit conditions are part of the mechanism by which our tightening ultimately reins in excess price pressures and brings inflation back to target, we will make sure that the process will be orderly throughout.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Voltaire said “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.” Faced with new and overlapping shocks, we have no choice today but to deal with uncertainty.
But the public can be certain about one thing: we will deliver price stability, and bringing inflation back to 2% over the medium term is non-negotiable.
We will do so by following a robust strategy that is data-dependent and embeds a readiness to act, but that does not entertain trade-offs around our primary objective.
Faced with a world that is changing faster than any of us could have imagined, we need to be both focused on our goal and robust in our strategy to achieve it."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 20 March 2023
I am happy to be back in this Parliament to discuss the ECB’s monetary policy shortly after last week’s Governing Council meeting.
More than one year has now passed since that February morning when we all woke up to the horrifying news of war in Europe. The Russian invasion of Ukraine – which you have selected as a topic for this hearing – is first and foremost a human tragedy for the people of Ukraine.
And in the face of this senseless atrocity, they have shown remarkable resilience and determination. In the words of the former President of this Parliament, José María Gil-Robles, who sadly passed away last month, “The future belongs to those who are prepared to make the effort to hear the voice of hope”.[1]
As Europeans, we need to continue hearing the voice of hope coming out of Ukraine and support the Ukrainian people in their struggle for freedom, democracy, and peace – the fundamental values of our Union. It is clear that solidarity, especially during this crisis, makes us stronger and more resilient.
So we must continue to nurture our ability to act together – which has again proven effective over the past year: we have managed to reduce our dependence on Russian pipeline gas by roughly 80%, and gas prices have now fallen back to levels below those seen before the invasion.
In my remarks today, I will start by discussing current market developments and then proceed to outline our assessment of the euro area economy, before explaining our latest monetary policy decisions.
I welcome the swift action and the decisions taken by the Swiss authorities. These actions were instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.
We are monitoring market developments closely and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. In any case, the ECB’s policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
Outlook for the euro area economy and the ECB’s monetary policy
Let me now turn to the outlook for the euro area economy and monetary policy.
Euro area activity stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to Eurostat’s latest release. The outcome was slightly better than we had expected in December. However, private domestic demand fell sharply. High inflation, prevailing uncertainties and tighter financing conditions dented private consumption and investment, which fell by 0.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively.
Survey indicators for economic activity have steadily improved over recent months, coinciding with reduced concerns about energy shortages and price increases. These factors coupled with the ongoing support provided by fiscal policy and the continued resilience of the labour market, are expected to support a recovery over the coming quarters. Accordingly, projected growth for 2023 has been revised up to 1.0% in our latest staff projections, which also foresee growth of 1.6% in both 2024 and 2025. It has to be stressed, though, that the ECB staff projections were finalised before the recent emergence of financial market tensions. As such, these tensions imply additional uncertainty around the baseline assessments of inflation and growth.
I will now turn to inflation, which has decreased from its peak in October owing to a sharp drop in energy prices and stood at 8.5% in February. Input cost pressures, which are partly related to the past surge in energy costs and the impact of supply bottlenecks and re-opening effects, are all weakening. However, accumulated price-pressures are still spreading through the economy with a delay. As a result, inflation excluding energy and food, has continued to increase, reaching 5.6% in February.
Wage pressures have strengthened on the back of robust labour markets and employees aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power they have lost to high inflation. Moreover, many firms have been able to raise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand. The energy price shock implies a hit to the domestic economy, which should be absorbed by both firms and workers in order to ensure that it does not lead to a spiral of upward price and wage adjustments.
In the baseline of our latest staff projections, headline inflation has been revised down, mainly reflecting a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected. We now see inflation averaging 5.3% in 2023, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food is expected to average 4.6% in 2023, which is higher than foreseen in the December projections. Subsequently, it is projected to come down to 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, as the upward pressures from past supply shocks and the reopening of the economy fade out and as tighter monetary policy increasingly dampens demand.
As inflation is projected to remain too high for too long, the Governing Council last week decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with our determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to our policy rate decisions, which will be determined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The key ECB interest rates remain our primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance.
The reduction of the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio – the second topic for today’s hearing – is part of our monetary policy normalisation. As of the beginning of this month, the APP portfolio has been declining at a measured and predictable pace of €15 billion per month on average and will continue to do so until the end of June 2023. The subsequent pace will be determined over time and the Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions.
Conclusion
Let me now conclude.
With war in Europe and high inflation requiring immediate action, policymakers may be inclined to divert their attention from long-term challenges – but we must all strive to keep up our efforts to address the existential crisis of climate change.
For us at the ECB, this means continuing to make progress on our climate roadmap.[2]This week we will publish the first climate-related financial disclosures of the Eurosystem’s corporate sector assets held for monetary policy purposes, and of the ECB’s own funds and the staff pension fund. We will be joined in the coming weeks by all Eurosystem central banks, which will disclose climate information on their own euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios.
Besides helping us be more transparent about our climate impact, these disclosures help us track our progress towards supporting, within our mandate, a decarbonisation path in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and EU climate neutrality objectives. They will show, for example, that our corporate sector portfolio is becoming less carbon intensive, partly thanks to our efforts to tilt purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance.
Over time – as more and better-quality data become available – we will improve the level of detail and expand reporting to include other portfolios and asset classes. Better and harmonised climate disclosures for all asset classes would help not only the ECB, but also the entire financial sector, to better account for climate-related risks.[3]
Thank you for your attention, I now look forward to your questions."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the International Women’s Day event organised by World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva
Geneva, 8 March 2023
It is a pleasure to be here at the WTO to discuss women and the economy on such an important occasion: International Women’s Day.
And this discussion is happening at a critical time: geopolitical tensions and the fragmenting of world trade are threatening to roll back decades of advances in women’s economic empowerment.
Since the great financial crisis, the global economy has been hit by a series of unprecedented shocks – most recently, Russia’s war against Ukraine. And all this has taken its toll on trade growth, which has plateaued as a share of world GDP.[1]
Instead, protectionism is on the rise – and may well get worse – as countries reconfigure their supply chains to align with new strategic goals. The number of trade restrictions in place has jumped tenfold over the last decade.[2]
This is not to say we are facing an outright deglobalisation – far from it. The powerful economic logic underpinning the gains from international trade remains as valid as ever for governments and firms alike.
But the nature of globalisation is changing. We are likely to see more trade within blocs as countries that share common values and interests deepen their trade ties to increase their resilience to external shocks and threats. And the changing nature of globalisation can have implications for women empowerment.
The rise of global trade has been intricately tied to women’s emancipation. In developing countries, firms that trade internationally are also those that employ more women. Women make up a third of the workforce of such firms, compared to less than a quarter for non-exporting firms.[3]
And in advanced economies, tariff burdens can at times fall disproportionately on the shoulders of women. In the US, the average tariff rates on products for women are higher than those for men.[4]
Overall, countries that are more open to trade tend to have higher levels of gender equality.[5]That is in part because trade liberalisation is linked to a higher accumulation of education and skills for women.[6]
So we need to act immediately – not only to preserve, but to expand on the existing achievements won for women’s economic empowerment. And we need to ensure that a changing global economy does not introduce new inequalities.[7]
Action can be taken on three broad fronts.
First, we need to ensure that trade remains as open as possible within new geopolitical constraints. And this especially applies to maintaining market access for developing countries that should not have to suffer from great power competition.
Second, we need to make gender a more substantive component of trade negotiations so that women benefit as much as they should. Today, over 80 regional or bilateral trade agreements have at least one provision mentioning gender or women.[8]That number needs to increase.
Third, we need to see more women in leadership positions, since that could support trade openness and arrest the slide towards fragmentation.
Female leaders tend to possess qualities that can be especially beneficial in times of geopolitical tensions. One study finds that they are particularly good at thinking holistically, managing complexity and embracing cooperation – attributes that are ideal when it comes to trade negotiations.[9]
At heart is a reciprocal relationship – trade can empower women, and women can empower trade.
But we still have some way to go before female leadership becomes as prominent as it needs to be in this world. For instance, women have held only 12% of the top jobs at the biggest multilateral institutions since 1945.[10]That has to change. And I have no doubt that, together, we will get there.
As we celebrate International Women’s Day, I think of the young women that I see today, and the opportunities that stand before them. And the words of the writer Gertrude Stein come to mind: “You are extraordinary within your limits, but your limits are extraordinary.”
Because today is not simply about how we, as women, respond to a changing global economy. It is about how we shape it, too.
Thank you."
159,2023-03-08,Fabio Panetta,The Quick and the Dead: building up cyber resilience in the financial sector,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230308~92211cd1f5.en.html,"The Quick and the Dead: building up cyber resilience in the financial sector
Introductory remarks by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures
Frankfurt am Main, 8 March 2023
The proliferation of cyber threat actors combined with an increase in remote working and greater digital interconnectedness is raising the risk, frequency and severity of cyberattacks.[1]Increasingly, cyber criminals are launching ransomware attacks and demanding payment in crypto. Cyberattacks related to geopolitical developments – Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in particular – have also become a more common feature of the cyber-threat landscape.
TheEuro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures(ECRB) has played a key role in protecting the security and integrity of the financial system from these threats. The last three years have shown that we can work under adverse conditions towards a common goal. Our financial infrastructures have proven their resilience to cyber threats. But this does not mean we can become complacent or any less vigilant in the face of cyber threats. We simply cannot afford to fall behind the curve: cybersecurity must be the backbone of digital finance.
Today I will take stock of the ECRB’s work. I will then discuss current cyber threats and emerging risks before outlining the implications for our work in the future.
The contribution of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board
The ECRB brings together private and public stakeholders across pan-European financial infrastructures, critical service providers, central banks and other authorities. This offers a unique prism through which the ECRB can identify and fix any weaknesses which cyberattacks could potentially exploit in order to propagate, which in turn would cause systemic ripples throughout the European financial ecosystem.
Let me give three examples of why the ECRB is such a useful forum for cooperation.
First, in the area of information sharing, the ECRB’s Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU)[2]allows members to exchange information about cyber threats and mitigation in a secure and trusted group environment.
Second, the ECRB has established a crisis coordination protocol that facilitates cooperation and coordination, allowing members to exchange and respond to major cyber threats and incidents.
Third, in the area of training and awareness, the ECRB conducts joint assessments and training sessions to increase common knowledge and understanding. A key pillar of the ECB’s cyber strategy for financial infrastructures is the TIBER-EU framework for threat-led penetration testing, also known as red teaming. In June 2022 the ECRB organised a dedicated roundtable on TIBER-EU where members shared their experience of these kinds of exercises.[3]
In view of their systemic role in the financial system, we will continue to focus on pan-European financial infrastructures. Nonetheless, financial infrastructures are increasingly interdependent through horizontal and vertical links and common participants. They are also reliant on information and communication technology and on third-party service providers. As a result, these infrastructures are exposed to common risks and vulnerabilities through which cyberattacks could propagate swiftly if they are not rigorously managed. The ECRB allows us to join forces to address these risks on a sector-wide level.
Adapting to a constantly changing cyber threat landscape
Let me now turn to the cyber threat landscape.
Threats are becoming increasingly complex. Recent attacks call for constant vigilance at an operational level, and the continuous reassessment of regulatory and oversight frameworks to see whether they need to be updated.[4]Significant but unpredictable shifts can occur at any time. We must therefore be prepared to understand them and to adapt quickly in order to mitigate the financial ecosystem’s susceptibility to cyberattacks.
The ECRB has identified supply chain attacks and ransomware as key threats in the current environment, and artificial intelligence (AI) as an emerging threat. We have also witnessed how geopolitical developments, most recently Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, have weaponised cyberspace. The most prominent examples are distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against government and financial entities.[5]
Let me discuss the key current and emerging threats in more detail.
The financial ecosystem’s reliance on third-party products and services is a key risk, especially when financial entities outsource critical functions to them. An attack on these third parties or on their products and services can disrupt and harm the financial infrastructures that rely on them, with spillovers to interconnected entities.
When such third-party products and services are widely used in the financial ecosystem, a cyberattack can have widespread, possibly systemic effects by having an impact on multiple financial entities at once. That is why cyber threat actors target these third parties. In so doing, they can compromise numerous financial entities simultaneously.
The recent cyberattack on the third-party provider ION Cleared Derivatives shows how an attack on one software provider may cascade onto their clients. In this specific case, the disruptions to the trading and clearing of financial derivatives remained limited, but we cannot ignore scenarios where the attacks could have propagated quickly, disrupting the financial system.
This case signalled the need for financial entities to review their third-party providers, the providers of these third-parties, their cyber resilience levels and the systemic impact that may ensue from a cyberattack on any of these providers. In particular, it is vital to assess critical service dependencies on third-party products and services which could be disrupted or even terminated as a result of a cyberattack. Mitigating measures need to be put in place.
Against this background, the G7 recently updated its Fundamental Elements for Third-Party Cyber Risk Management in the Financial Sector[6]. In addition, the ECRB set up a working group in 2022 to support third-party cyber risk management.
We must have a cyber resilience mindset at all times. The question we must ask is not if a cyberattack will happen, but whether we are ready to respond when it happens. Over the past year, the ECRB has worked on a conceptual model for how the financial infrastructure ecosystem could manage such a crisis if it occurred. It has also developed protocols and networks aimed at supporting a collective, consistent and comprehensive response to a cyber crisis by stakeholders.
The proliferation of ransomware is one of the most significant challenges currently facing financial entities. Not only may ransomware attacks result in financial loss, they may also severely disrupt operations. Even after a ransom is paid, there is no guarantee the decryption key will actually work or that the stolen data will not be publicly disclosed or further misused to extort victims’ customers, for example.
Ransomware attacks are growing more sophisticated and damaging, which in turn may enable ransomware threat actors to obtain even more resources. 2022 was one of the most active years for ransomware activity.[7]However, it was also the first year that the majority of victims of ransomware attacks decided not to pay up[8], which indicates that the approach towards ransomware attacks is changing.
Authorities globally are stepping up their efforts to counter ransomware. For instance, the G7 issued Fundamental Principles on Ransomware Resilience in October 2022[9].
We need to tackle ransomware attacks from various angles.
First, every firm must be ready to repel ransomware attacks, either through the use of proper cyber hygiene practices or by ensuring that data is backed up regularly and is kept up-to-date and tamper-proof.
Second, enforcement agencies need to conduct forensic analyses, locate attackers and join forces to prosecute them.
Third, crypto-assets – especially unbacked crypto-assets, which are used to make ransomware payments owing to the anonymity and money laundering possibilities they offer[10]– need to be strictly regulated.[11]Similarly, crypto-asset transfers must be traceable.
The proposed EU Regulation for Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and revision to the Regulation on information accompanying transfers of funds, which extends the “travel rule”[12]to crypto-assets, are important steps. However, to be effective and prevent regulatory arbitrage, regulation must be stepped up globally.[13]Implementation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance for crypto-assets and its enforcement at international level are therefore crucial.[14]
In addition, all firms need to have the highest level of cyber controls in place to prevent attacks from being successful and to detect and recover from ransomware attacks. Moreover, insurance firms can lend their support by obtaining assurances from their clients that they have high-level cyber resilience plans in place before providing cyber risk insurance policies, thus ensuring that these very same policies do not lower firms’ incentives to prepare for cyberattacks.
Even if we do not realise it, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is already widespread. We use AI every day, including on our phones, in our homes and at the workplace. And firms use it to harness big data.
AI can help to strengthen cybersecurity, for instance, by improving the detection of highly sophisticated cyberattacks through its ability to identify abnormal system behaviour compared with an established baseline. This is the kind of potential that we need to leverage.
But AI can also multiply cyber risks by, for instance, helping malicious individuals, even those who have limited or no technical skills, draft very convincing phishing emails or identify topics that will achieve the maximum engagement from those being targeted. To make matters worse, AI can even create and fix code that can be used to exploit and compromise the endpoint.[15]This opens up new possibilities for malicious individuals to use AI to launch cyberattacks. Although AI development firms try to install safeguards to prevent its unethical use, they can be circumvented.
The risks from AI need to be clearly understood and addressed through regulation and oversight. By exchanging information among its members and organising roundtables and training, the ECRB is in a strong position to raise awareness of risks at an early stage and accumulate knowledge of these types of threats. For its part, the European Commission has proposed a Regulation on artificial intelligence that aims to address some of the key risks associated with AI.[16]
Conclusion
As we realised some years ago, cyber threats are here to stay. Many highly-adaptable threat actors exist who will systematically try to exploit any weakness or vulnerability for illegal purposes. Existing threats are becoming more dangerous and new threats are on the horizon. We therefore need to adapt our operational and cyber resilience frameworks constantly at the individual level as well as collectively through strict regulation, enforcement and prosecution. Future cooperation between public and private institutions will also be crucial. The ECRB can make a decisive contribution to this effort in relation to the financial system."

Lecture by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Trinity College Dublin
Dublin, 6 March 2023
Introduction
When inflation has been far from target for a sustained period and the process of monetary tightening has been under way for some time, there are three primary inputs into monetary policy decisions.[1]First, in view of the medium-term orientation of monetary policy, the inflation forecast over the next one to three years plays an important role. Second, the incoming information on underlying inflation constitutes an essential additional basis for assessing medium-term inflation dynamics, in view of the conditional nature, the lower frequency of production and the intrinsic uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic forecasts.[2]Third, especially in view of the transmission lags from shifts in the monetary policy stance to the financial system, the economy and inflation dynamics, assessing the incoming information on the transmission of previous monetary policy decisions is also necessary for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy decisions.[3]
My focus today is on the second input: underlying inflation. The assessment of underlying inflation (which should be understood in a broad sense, including the information contained in wage dynamics and inflation expectations) should be viewed as a complementary cross-check to the inflation forecasting process. In one direction, if the signals from underlying inflation at a given point in time support the narrative embedded in the inflation forecast, this boosts confidence levels (among policymakers, market participants, firms and households) in the inflation forecasts. In the other direction, if the signals from underlying inflation at a given point in time are at odds with the inflation forecast, this calls for robust policy decisions that take into account the different signals coming from the forecast and the analysis of underlying inflation.[4]
My plan for this lecture is as follows. First, I will discuss the conceptual issues involved in analysing underlying inflation. Second, I will review the recent data flows that are relevant for assessing underlying inflation in the euro area. Third, I will offer some concluding remarks on the role of underlying inflation in the setting of monetary policy over the coming months.
Underlying inflation: conceptual issues
Ehrmann et al. (2018) summarise the basis for examining measures of underlying inflation as follows: “The central bank faces the problem of distinguishing in real time the “signal” on medium-term inflationary pressure contained in the HICP inflation data from the “noise” stemming from temporary or idiosyncratic factors. To this end, measures of underlying inflation are routinely monitored. Generally, their purpose is to obtain an estimate of where headline inflation will settle in the medium term after temporary factors have vanished.”[5]
In view of the major dislocations of recent years (the pandemic, the energy shock, the war), it is helpful to think of headline inflation as currently being driven by three factors: (a) pure noise; (b) a reverting component; and (c) underlying inflation. In particular, the economics of dislocations suggest that there is currently a substantial reverting component of inflation that is sufficiently long-lasting not to constitute pure noise but that can also be expected to fade out over the near term. Examples of the reverting component include: the passthrough of energy and food cost shocks to other sectors; the impact of bottlenecks; and pandemic re-opening effects by which there are temporary mismatches between demand and supply in contact-intensive sectors. These factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation since the middle of 2021 and, even if there has been some easing or even a reversal in these factors, the adjustment process to these shocks is still ongoing and is not likely to come to a sudden stop. While the adjustment process may also affect medium-term inflation dynamics, the quantitative contribution to inflation is plausibly larger over the near term than over the medium term. Since the peak impact of monetary policy is further out than one year, this reverting component of inflation should be less important for monetary policy than the medium-term underlying component.
Since the standard measures of underlying inflation typically make a two-level distinction between the transitory and persistent components of inflation, these standard measures should not be taken at face value under conditions in which the slowly-reverting component might be (at least partly) mis-classified as contributing to medium-term inflation dynamics. It follows that the interpretation of the standard measures require additional analysis under current conditions to take into account the potential role of the reverting component.
Before turning to the analysis of the range of indicators of underlying inflation, it is also necessary to recognise that the trajectory of the underlying inflation component can be affected by shocks to the noise and reverting components of inflation. First, even a pure noise shock can have a permanent effect on the price level if a positive inflation shock is not followed by a subsequent negative inflation shock. This holds even more strongly for a shock to the reverting component: since a sustained period of high inflation can leave a large footprint on the price level if it is not fully reversed. In turn, a surprise permanent increase in the price level can trigger medium-term inflation dynamics through its impact on the subsequent path for nominal wages, as some unwinding of the initial decline in real wages can be expected and the wage adjustment process can play out over an extended period.[6]Second, especially if there is a backwards-looking component in how firms, households and financial market participants form beliefs, a period of high inflation can persistently alter inflation expectations, with a direct and substantial impact on medium-term inflation expectations. Again, this risk is more substantial in relation to the reverting component than the pure noise component of inflation.
For these reasons, actual inflation outcomes and measures of inflation expectations belong in the family of indicators that are relevant in assessing the underlying inflation pressures. In one direction, strong increases in headline inflation or an upward above-target revision in inflation expectations would reinforce upward pressure on underlying inflation; in the other direction, a material decline in headline inflation or an easing in above-target inflation expectations should alleviate upward pressure on underlying inflation.
Underlying Inflation: indicators and analytics
Inflation increased very quickly since the middle of 2021 (Chart 1). While the peak was at 10.6 per cent in October, inflation has remained at a high level, with the February reading still at 8.5 per cent. Comparing headline inflation to the various standard indicators of underlying inflation, Chart 1 also shows that the decline in inflation has been primarily due to the easing of some temporary inflation pressures, most notably the remarkable decline in gas prices in recent months.[7]Chart 1 also shows that various forecasts (including the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections) project a substantial decline in inflation later in 2023 that extends into 2024 and 2025. The gap between standard measures of underlying inflation and these forecasts poses significant interpretative challenges for policymakers.
As shown in Chart 1, the ECB tracks several indicators of underlying inflation. Each indicator has its advantages and disadvantages: monitoring a range of indicators helps to guard from any specific approach being affected by idiosyncratic factors and model uncertainty.[8]The most prominent standard indicator of underlying inflation is core inflation defined as the HICP excluding energy and food (HICPX), which stands at 5.6 per cent in the February data. The latest available (January) estimates show that the other underlying inflation indicators range between 4.1 per cent (Persistent and Common Component of Inflation - PCCI - excluding energy) and 8.1 per cent (the 10 per cent trimmed mean). While the PCCI measures have eased in recent months, most other indicators do not show signs of a turnaround.[9]In overall terms, the range is not only elevated but also wide, indicating that there is a high level of uncertainty about underlying inflation.
In trying to gain further understanding about underlying inflation dynamics, it is worthwhile to examine momentum in inflation dynamics. While the typical focus is on an annual frequency (the price level today compared to the price level one year ago), this necessarily implies some inertia in inflation measurement, given the high overlap on a month-to-month basis in annual inflation calculations. At the same time, switching focus to a much higher frequency (such as month-to-month inflation data) runs the risk of increasing the noise-to-signal ratio in view of the role of seasonal and idiosyncratic factors in the monthly data.
An intermediate option is to examine as momentum indicators the 3 month on 3 month seasonally-adjusted inflation data (annualised for comparability purposes). Chart 2 shows the momentum indicators for the main HICP categories.[10]While there has been a clear turnaround in energy inflation and there are some signs of deceleration for food inflation, momentum for core inflation has not declined. In particular, momentum in the goods category remains strong.
The momentum indicator for services inflation requires a nuanced interpretation. The basic series suggests an easing of services inflation since November. An alternative series (the dashed line) that excludes the impact of the cheap travel ticket scheme in Germany last summer indicates that services inflation started easing in August but with a partial reversal in February, which came in at 0.1 percentage points above the January reading.[11]Indeed, this alternative series may better capture the severe pressure on services prices during the intense phase of pandemic reopening in the spring and summer of 2022 that was partly offset at the time by measures such as the German travel ticket scheme. In any event, these differential momentum patterns reinforce the importance of taking a granular approach to understanding inflation dynamics, since the relative contributions of the noise, reverting and underlying components may vary across categories. Moreover, in relation to core inflation, the goods and services categories are shaped by quite different forces, such that it is important to take due account of the individual trajectories of goods inflation and services inflation.[12]
In trying to assess the potential contribution of a reverting component to inflation dynamics, one basic question to ask is whether the recent declines in energy prices should also contribute to lower food inflation and core inflation in the coming months (over and above the operation of base effects by which earlier price increases drop out of the inflation calculation). There are two potential channels. First, energy constitutes a significant cost component for many sectors. During the phase of intense energy price increases, these put upward pressure on costs and prices in other sectors over the last eighteen months. While the impact on pricing decisions of cost declines may not be fully symmetric to the impact of cost increases, some passthrough should be expected. Second, the decline in headline inflation means that the increase in the cost of living (the overall price level) is now lower than expected in the December staff projections. In turn, all else equal, less upward pressure on the cost of living should mean a lower path for nominal wages (albeit playing out over an extended period), which is a central factor in the determination of underlying inflation.
To assess passthrough from energy to core inflation (the first channel), it is helpful to look at the dynamic correlations between these two components.Chart 3 shows that there were typically negative correlations between energy inflation and core inflation in the first decade of the euro (possibly reflecting the endogenous reaction of monetary policy to headline inflation).[13]However, positive contemporaneous correlations were observed more frequently after the financial crisis. This could indicate that the speed of the pass-through from energy to core inflation has increased since the financial crisis.[14]Over the last eighteen months, the correlation of energy and core inflation has become increasingly contemporaneous – reflecting that energy has passed through very quickly to core inflation and been an important factor in the recent increase in core inflation in the euro area. This could imply that the recent decline in energy prices could also be reflected much more quickly than usual in core inflation in the euro area.
The easing of pandemic-related supply bottlenecks is a second relevant factor in assessing the role of a reverting component in inflation. Chart 4 shows the sustained easing in supply bottlenecks in recent months, with the improvement largely due to the easing of supply constraints. While the improvement in supply bottlenecks can be expected to alleviate one source of upward pressure on prices, it is not yet clear whether the upward impact of earlier supply chain problems on final consumer prices has fully played out.[15]Indeed, the current strength of goods inflation suggests that the easing of bottlenecks is not yet feeding through into retail prices, even if there are indications of easing at the intermediate stage in the pricing chain.
This is illustrated in Chart 5. Early in the pricing chain, producer price inflation and import price inflation for intermediate goods have been decreasing strongly since April 2022 – reflecting lower pressures from input costs including energy and raw materials. These appear to have fed through now also to later stages of the pricing chain with import prices for non-food consumer goods decreasing from 8.6% in October to 7.0% in November and 5.8% in December. Producer prices for non-food consumer goods as the most important leading indicator for goods inflation have also decreased in January after strong previous increases and moderated from 9.4% in December to 8.8% in January 2023. Based on these developments the ECB’s indicator for producer price pressures (IPPI) estimates that the pressures on goods inflation are likely to be close to their peak and to decline over 2023.[16]However, there remain upside risks to the extent that previous increases in pipeline pressures have not yet fully passed through to goods inflation.
The pandemic has affected inflation dynamics not only through supply bottlenecks but also through the supply-demand mismatches associated initially with lockdown episodes and subsequently with the sustained re-opening of the euro area economy over the last year. As shown in Chart 6, limits to short-term supply elasticities meant that the recovery in demand enabled firms to also increase profit margins in those sectors exhibiting supply-demand mismatches. To the extent that supply capacity should improve over time and demand patterns normalise, the extraordinary conditions underpinning profitability in 2022 should not persist, with a decline in profit margins translating into lower inflationary pressures.
These factors can be jointly illustrated through supply-demand decompositions for goods inflation and services inflation, as is shown in Charts 7 and 8.[17]For both goods and services, supply factors continue to exert a strong influence on inflation. Lower energy costs, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the lagged increase in supply capacity in response to the pandemic reopening should ease the supply component of inflation over time.
An alternative decomposition for the services sector is shown in Chart 9. This decomposition divides the services sector into four sub-categories: (a) sectors that are both contact-intensive and energy-intensive (33.0 per cent of total services expenditure); (b) sectors that are contact-intensive but not energy-intensive (6.3 per cent of total services expenditure); (c) sectors that are energy-intensive but not contact-intensive (10.2 per cent of total services expenditure); and (d) sectors that are neither contact-intensive nor energy-intensive (50.4 per cent of total services expenditure). We should expect the combined impact of the pandemic cycle and the energy shock to be strongest in category (a) and weakest in category (d). Indeed, we see that the contribution from category (d) has increased only very gradually, while the contribution from category (a) has gone from about zero in the middle of 2021 to about two percentage points of services inflation in January 2023. That is, nearly half of services inflation is being generated by the category that is most affected by the energy shock and pandemic-related factors. To the extent that the reversal in energy costs and the easing of pandemic-related factors reduces pricing pressures in this category, this highly atypical configuration may not persist.
Chart 10 provides a further perspective on the role of energy costs in determining core inflation by allocating the 211 items in the HICPX into energy-intensive and non-energy-intensive groups. Before the start of the energy surge in 2021 there was no link observed between the energy intensity (measured as the direct share of energy in input costs based on input-output tables) and the cumulative increase in inflation since December 2019. This picture changes when data up to January 2023 is taken into account: the inflation rate of HICPX items has tended to be higher, the greater the energy intensity. This can be seen as indicating the outsized contribution of energy to core inflation when energy inflation is very high. The important role of the surge in energy prices observed since the start of 2021 is also reflected by a sub-aggregate of HICPX including only those items with an energy share above average, which increased by 6.7 per cent in January 2023 (albeit down from 7.0 per cent in December 2022), whereas the inflation rate for the sub-aggregate of HICPX with an energy share below average stood at 4.3% in January (albeit up from 3.9% in December 2022).
The right panel of Chart 10 also shows that inflation for the wage-sensitive sectors within HICPX has been increasing steadily, even if remaining at a much lower level than the energy-sensitive component or overall core inflation. We next turn to the inter-connections between wage inflation and price inflation.
The importance of labour costs in total costs in many sectors (especially in the services category) means that wage inflation is deeply inter-connected with price inflation. Furthermore, the staggered, infrequent and decentralised nature of wage setting means that it is likely to take several years for wages to adjust fully to the surprise price inflation that has already occurred.[18]In this way, the wage adjustment process may put upward pressure on price inflation over the next two or three years, even if the long-term behaviour of wages were ultimately unaffected by the current inflation shock (with the stability of long-term inflation expectations and aligned long-term wage dynamics reinforcing each other). That is, once the equilibrium level of real wages has been attained after the wage catch- up phase, we might expect nominal wages to grow at the rate corresponding to the sum of labour productivity growth and the two per cent inflation target.
Chart 11 shows that wage inflation has been below consumer price inflation since the start of 2021, resulting in a decline in real consumer wages: for instance, the real value of compensation per employee declined around 5 percentage points below the 2021Q1 level.[19]This can largely be attributed to the unexpected and sudden nature of the increase in inflation. While some decline in real wages may be in line with the adverse terms of trade shock associated with the surge in energy prices, some catchup in real wages can be expected.
Indeed, the ECB indicator of negotiated wage rates, available up to December 2022, reflects a gradual increase in wage pressures since the beginning of 2021.[20]Abstracting from one-off payments, there was a steady but quite contained increase in this series through the fourth quarter of 2022, with the latest values of annual growth rate around three per cent. Allowing for typical labour productivity growth of about one per cent per year, a nominal wage growth of three per cent per year would be broadly aligned with delivering our two per cent medium-term inflation target.
However, as shown in Chart 12, there are two indicators that suggest that the negotiated wage indicator understates the current degree of nominal wage momentum. First, a broader forward-looking experimental tracker of negotiated wage growth has been developed by the ECB in cooperation with national central banks (Chart 12).[21]This wage tracker aggregates information from collective bargaining agreements across euro area countries and includes information on the latest wage increases that have been agreed for 2023.[22]Contract negotiations during 2022 have typically delivered a 4.4 per cent wage increase for 2022 and a 4.8 per cent increase for 2023. Additionally, the wage increases agreed for 2023 have shifted upwards towards the end of the year over 2022. This suggests that nominal negotiated wage growth based on latest agreements is set to be higher this year compared with the level that would be consistent in the medium term with the two per cent overall inflation target.
A second wage growth tracker based on Indeed job postings data has been developed by Adrjan and Lydon (2022).[23]These data reflect the pay offered to the marginal worker (a new hire). At the same time, it should be recognised that, in a tight labour market, hiring wages are likely to outpace the wages offered to existing workers such that the level of the wage growth tracker is not necessarily an indicator of the expected future level of aggregate growth in negotiated wages. Rather, it is more likely to serve as a leading indicator of the momentum in wage dynamics. For instance, the earlier pickup in this wage tracker since summer 2021 foreshadowed the subsequent pickup in the negotiated wage growth measure and the strong increases in the wage tracker indicator during 2022 suggest that there will be further increases in the growth rate of overall negotiated wages. At the same time, this tracker shows some tentative signs of easing in the latest readings.
In view of these developments, the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections were based on an assessment that compensation per employee growth will increase from 4.5 per cent in 2022 to 5.2 per cent in 2023, 4.5 per cent in 2024 and 3.9 per cent in 2025 and unit labour costs by 3.2, 5.0, 3.1 and 2.6 per cent, respectively.[24]The higher-than-normal nominal wage increases largely reflect the catch up process following the drop in real wages that has occurred since the middle of 2021.
These rates of high wage growth are expected to lead to a rotation toward wage growth as a main driver of underlying inflation in the euro area (Chart 13).The contribution of wage intensive items – defined as those HICPX items for which wages account for more than 40 per cent of input costs – has increased with the upward trend of wage pressures after the pandemic but has so far remained moderate. However, the high levels of wage growth projected for 2023 and 2024 can be expected to make wages an increasingly dominant driver of underlying inflation in the euro area. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis, the close inspection of the latest wage developments is a high priority in assessing underlying inflation.
There is a clear risk that an extended period of above-target inflation may induce consumers, workers, firms and financial market participants to re-consider their beliefs about the future path of inflation, especially if the behavioural norm for many economic agents is to follow adaptive belief-formation processes by which high current inflation generates a persistent increase in the expected future inflation rate.[25]
Chart 14 summarises a range of indicators of inflation expectations. Panel A shows that one-year ahead inflation expectations eased slightly and the three-year ahead inflation expectations remained stable in the December vintage of the Consumer Expectations Survey, with both measures well below the current inflation rate, suggesting that consumers interpret that there is a high temporary component in current inflation.[26]While the three-year ahead expectation jumped at the start of the war in March 2022, it has remained quite stable since then.
Panel B shows that professional forecasters expect inflation to return close to target over the medium term.[27]As captured in Panel C, market-based measures also indicate a rapid decline in inflation over 2023 and 2024. While the cost of inflation protection has increased recently at longer horizons (as reflected in the 5yr5yr rate in Panel D), this can be interpreted as largely reflecting an increase in the inflation risk premium.[28]This increase in inflation risk compensation reflects the high current uncertainty about inflation dynamics (both in the euro area and globally).
The basic theme of this speech is that underlying inflation measures can only be properly interpreted in the context of a wider assessment of the incidence of shocks driving the economic outlook. To this end, a heatmap that reports a wide range of ancillary measures may be helpful.
A heatmap, showing where a given indicator lies compared to its distribution since 2018, points to a mixed picture, with some signs of easing pressures (Chart 15). The first feature that emerges from the heatmap is the transmission of the price pressures along the pricing chain, with “red spots” generally emerging first on the commodity front and then showing up in producer prices and further “downstream”. Compared to the peaks during the re-opening phase of last year, the latest observations point to weaker pressures from the energy commodities, non-energy and non-food commodities, global and domestic economic activity and supply side bottlenecks.
By contrast, stronger pressures are indicated by the indicators for food-related costs and labour market developments, in particular from the tight labour market and from wage growth. Generally, producer price pressures are still elevated, reflecting recent increases in input costs. Overall, the heatmap suggests still strong inflationary pressures, but some signs of easing are emerging.
Conclusions
In this lecture, I have highlighted that the monitoring of underlying inflation is an essential input into the monetary policy process. I have emphasised that an accurate assessment of underlying inflation is especially tricky in view of the large dislocations that have hit the economy, since the energy crisis and the pandemic have generated inflation shocks that do not fit neatly into either the “pure noise” or “medium term” components of inflation but rather also plausibly contribute to a “reverting” component of inflation. Differentiating the reverting and medium-term components of inflation the main analytical challenge and is inevitably subject to high uncertainty.[29]
There are no short cuts in the analysis of underlying inflation, which requires a comprehensive multi-variate and multi-method assessment. In particular, the tracking of underlying inflation must rely on a wide range of data sources and take full account of the latest developments. This reinforces the value of a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to monetary policy decision making, especially in conjunction with the importance of measuring the impact of the cumulative tightening in the monetary policy stance that has already occurred.
For the ECB, the monetary policy priority is to make sure that inflation returns to target in a timely manner. The current information on underlying inflation pressures suggests that it will be appropriate to raise rates further beyond our March meeting, while the exact calibration beyond March should reflect the information contained in the upcoming macroeconomic projections, together with the incoming data on inflation and the operation of the monetary transmission mechanism. By bringing the key policy rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and fostering a period of below-trend growth through the dampening of demand, we will counter-act above-target medium-term inflation pressures and also ensure that the prolonged phase of above-target inflation does not become embedded through a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. In particular, the dampening of demand through the tightening of monetary policy means that price setters and wage setters are on notice that excessive price and wage increases will not be sustainable.
Looking at the upcoming data flows between our March and May meetings, our evolving assessment will be informed by: the inflation outcomes for March and April; the Q1 GDP data flash release; the range of sentiment indices (including PMIs and other indicators); new editions of our own surveys (the Corporate Telephone Survey, the Survey of Monetary Analysts, the Consumer Expectations Survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Bank Lending Survey); the updated information on employment and wage dynamics; incoming data on credit creation and bank lending rates; and, in relation to fiscal policy, the Stability Programme Updates that will be submitted in April from the member states."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting
Frankfurt am Main, 2 March 2023
Eight years ago, we launched the asset purchase programme (APP). It was the first time the ECB employed quantitative easing (QE) to help secure price stability when the space for further policy rate cuts was becoming constrained by the effective lower bound.
By now, there is a wealth of evidence suggesting that the APP was successful in lowering long-term interest rates, stimulating economic activity and raising inflation at times when price pressures were unusually weak.[1]
As risks to medium-term price stability had increased sharply, we decided in June 2022 to end net asset purchases under the APP as of July. In December, we announced that the APP portfolio would decline at a measured and predictable pace as of March 2023. This became effective yesterday when we started limiting reinvestments of maturing securities.
Until the end of June 2023, the APP portfolio will decline by €15 billion per month on average.[2]For our corporate bond portfolio, the remaining reinvestments will be tilted more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and without prejudice to our primary mandate.[3]In the second quarter of this year, the Governing Council will reassess the pace of APP portfolio reduction.
I will start my remarks today by presenting the rationale for conducting quantitative tightening (QT).
Reducing the size of our balance sheet is warranted for three reasons: first, to regain valuable policy space in an environment in which the current large volume of excess liquidity is not needed for steering short-term market interest rates; second, to mitigate the negative side effects associated with a large central bank balance sheet and footprint in financial markets; and third, to withdraw policy accommodation to support our intended monetary policy stance.
I will then explain the effects of the reduction of our balance sheet on broader financial markets. While QT will not simply be a reversal of QE, investors anticipating balance sheet run-off are likely to have gradually reversed some of the risk premium compression induced by our asset purchases, thereby contributing to the timely return of inflation to our 2% target.
Why quantitative tightening?
Let me start by discussing the rationale for QT in more detail.
The first reason relates to the ECB’s operational framework.
After the start of the APP in 2015, wede factomoved from a corridor system for steering short-term market rates towards a floor system, as the large increase in excess liquidity caused money market rates to converge to the rate applied by the Eurosystem to its deposit facility (the deposit facility rate, or DFR; Slide 2).[4]
In the ongoing review of our operational framework, we are analysing whether in the future we will operate under a floor or a corridor system. We hope to conclude this review by the end of the year.
One important element in our discussion is the amount of central bank reserves required to effectively steer short-term interest rates in either a floor or a corridor system. This amount informs our decision-making as to when balance sheet normalisation might need to be halted.
Structural and regulatory changes have made estimating the demand for reserves more challenging than before the global financial crisis.[5]
However, our current estimates suggest that the amount of central bank reserves currently held by the banking sector exceeds, by a significant margin, the level necessary to steer short-term market rates close to our key policy rate even under a floor system.
This implies that the current size of our balance sheet is larger than necessary to effectively implement our monetary policy stance. As such, maintaining a large bond portfolio absorbs valuable policy space that may be needed if policy rates were to become constrained again by the effective lower bound.
Shrinking the balance sheet, to the extent possible, is therefore both prudent and efficient.
The second reason for reducing the APP portfolio is related to the side effects of running a large balance sheet.
It is well documented that bond purchases can cause asset price valuations in financial and real estate markets to diverge from their economic fundamentals, thus raising both financial stability risks and wealth inequality.[6]
Maintaining too large a balance sheet may also have undesirable side effects.
One is that it could jeopardise central bank’s credibility by giving rise to accusations of financial and fiscal dominance.
A second side effect is that maintaining a larger balance sheet than necessary increases the Eurosystem’s exposure to credit and duration risk. The probability and extent of net losses are significantly higher the larger the amount of long-term fixed-rate assets the central bank holds on its balance sheet.[7]
A third side effect relates to the functioning of financial markets.
The APP, together with the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), has left a visible footprint in euro area financial markets.
The Eurosystem’s outright holdings of euro area sovereign bonds currently amount to more than a third of the outstanding market (Slide 3). Mobilised collateral for longer-term refinancing operations further increases the encumbrance of government bonds through monetary policy operations.
As a result, the “scarcity premium” that market participants must pay to obtain these assets has often been considerable, both in the repo and the bond market (Slide 4).[8]The inception and expansion of the Eurosystem’s securities lending facility have been able to partly alleviate these strains.[9]
Yet, in times of heightened uncertainty, when the demand for safe and liquid assets rises sharply, market conditions tend to visibly deteriorate.
Last year’s surge in market volatility is a case in point.
As markets repriced the future path of short-term interest rates and uncertainty increased, the two-year Bund-overnight index swap (OIS) spread fell to record lows, while segments of the euro area repo market came under significant strain.
At times, around half of the repo volume backed by German collateral was trading more than 40 basis points below the general collateral rate (Slide 5).
Such asset scarcity can delay, or even impair, the transmission of monetary policy. A persistent negative Bund-OIS spread, for example, implies that sovereign yields in the euro area’s largest economy remain more accommodative than intended by our policy stance.
Similarly, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in September and October of last year to be fully reflected in many segments of the repo market (Slide 6, left-hand side).
The dispersion across repo market rates was particularly large in the week after the September Governing Council meeting when the DFR turned positive (Slide 6, right-hand side). At that point, uncertainty about the remuneration of some of the Eurosystem’s non-monetary policy deposits exacerbated investors’ concerns about collateral scarcity.[10]
The Eurosystem responded by temporarily removing the 0% interest rate ceiling for government deposits and announcing a further adjustment as of 1 May 2023, providing incentives for a gradual and orderly reduction of such deposits in order to minimise the risk of adverse effects on market functioning and ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy.[11]
Balance sheet run-off, together with higher expected net issuance, will gradually help alleviate the underlying tensions. It will increase the amount of government bonds in the hands of private investors and thereby help smooth the plumbing of the financial system.
Over time, QT will be more efficient in alleviating general asset scarcity per unit of balance sheet change than the repayments of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs).
While recent repayments have rechannelled government bonds that had been pledged with the Eurosystem back to the market, the release of high-quality collateral that is particularly scarce in repo markets has been limited (Slide 7, left-hand side).
This is because banks do not tend to mobilise their safest and most liquid assets as collateral with the Eurosystem, partly reflecting the introduction of collateral easing measures during the pandemic.
The impact of QT on the availability of sovereign bonds, by contrast, depends on the composition of maturing securities in our public sector purchase programme (PSPP) portfolio for which the share of higher-rated jurisdictions is substantially larger than for the collateral freed up by the TLTRO repayments (Slide 7, right-hand side).
The third consideration relates to the effect of the stock of our monetary policy bond holdings on our policy stance.
We have clarified that our key interest rates are currently the primary tool for restoring price stability.[12]At the same time, the large stock of assets acquired under QE continues to provide significant monetary policy accommodation that may run counter to our efforts to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a timely manner.
QT will gradually unwind this accommodative impact.
Broader market impact of quantitative tightening
How QT operates in practice, however, is highly uncertain. There are few historical episodes in which central banks have reduced the size of their bond portfolios.
The experience of the United States points to two polar cases. In the wake of the 2013 “taper tantrum”, the term premium of a ten-year US Treasury yield surged well before the Federal Reserve started reducing the pace of its purchases (Slide 8).
If QT was QE in reverse, balance sheet run-off would be expected to increase the term premium, which compensates investors for the risk of holding a longer-term bond. After all, compressing the term premium by removing duration risk is one of the key transmission channels of QE.[13]
Yet, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction that started in 2017 had no discernible impact on the term premium.[14]Instead, during that episode, QT was found to have tightened financing conditions mainly through the impact of scarcer central bank reserves on short-term money market rates.[15]
As for the current phase of QT in the United States, the jury is still out. So far, however, estimates of the term premium have remained compressed, suggesting that the recent rise in ten-year US Treasury yields reflects, by and large, a reappraisal of the future expected path of short-term interest rates.[16]
The literature points to three potential explanations as to why the impact of QT might be more muted.
One is that QT is missing the signalling component of QE.[17]That is, while balance sheet expansions signal a lower-for-longer interest rate policy, balance sheet reductions may provide little, if any, information about the future path of short-term interest rates.
The second reason is that the unwinding of QE is typically more gradual than the build-up in assets.[18]
The third explanation is that QT often happens in an environment of improved market functioning. Indeed, one reason why QE was so effective at the outbreak of the pandemic is that it quickly improved liquidity and reduced volatility.[19]
However, isolating the effect of QT is inherently difficult. Many different forces drive long-term yields. For example, purchases by non-resident investors of US Treasury securities accelerated sharply last year, likely reflecting growing interest rate differentials and the rise in uncertainty on the back of Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people (Slide 9).
Foreign investors alone absorbed nearly 60% of the net supply of US Treasuries in 2022. Increased foreign demand may have offset, at least in part, the impact of the higher actual and expected bond supply from QT.
Also, recent bond market developments in the euro area have differed from those in the United States. Last year, the ten-year GDP-weighted yield rose well above the levels implied by the estimated revisions to the expected future path of short-term interest rates (Slide 10, left-hand side).
We have seen similar developments across Member States, also for issuers with the highest credit rating (Slide 10, right-hand side). In Germany, for example, ten-year yields have increased by about 160 basis points over and above the pure expectations component since December 2021.
The question, then, is why we have seen such a broad-based and persistent rise in sovereign yields in the euro area, and whether, and to what extent, it is related to changes in investors’ expectations about the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet.
In answering this question, it is useful to recall that the gap between euro area long-term government bond yields and the expected average short-term rate can reflect two types of risk compensation: one is the term premium on the risk-free rate, which in the euro area is typically estimated from rates in the OIS market. The other is a country-specific risk premium, which includes liquidity and credit risk. This premium can simply be measured by the spread of a euro area bond yield over the equivalent OIS rate.
Term structure models show that, over the past year, a rise in the term premium accounted for a significant portion of the increase in the ten-year OIS rate (Slide 11, left-hand side). The ten-year OIS term premium currently stands at its highest level since 2013 (Slide 11, right-hand side).
The rise in the term premium reflects two interrelated developments. One is the fundamental change in the euro area’s inflation environment (the “nominal” term premium). The ten-year inflation risk premium increased sharply after a long period of persistently low inflation (Slide 12, left-hand side). About a year ago, it turned positive for the first time in almost ten years.
The other development relates to the uncertainty about the future path of short-term interest rates (the “real” term premium). The increase in inflation uncertainty, together with the retirement of forward guidance on policy rates, has raised uncertainty about future policy rates and hence market volatility (Slide 12, right-hand side).
As it turns out, the changes in the ten-year OIS term premium can largely explain the gap that has emerged between euro area sovereign yields and the expected future path of short-term interest rates.[20]
In other words, changes in the risk-free rate have been the prime market driver, so that the spread of the euro area ten-year GDP-weighted yield over the equivalent OIS rate has remained broadly stable over the past two years (Slide 13, left-hand side).
However, changes in the OIS term premium are not able to fully explain the gap between ten-year yields and the expected future path of short-term interest rates in all parts of the euro area. Issuers with lower credit ratings, in particular, saw their spreads over the OIS increase, albeit to a limited degree in most cases (Slide 13, right-hand side).
A rise in spreads, however, would be expected if QT was a reversal of QE. This can be seen when considering one of the main transmission channels of asset purchases: the portfolio rebalancing channel.[21]
This channel works in two complementary ways. One way is that asset purchases lower the yields on benchmark government bonds and thus induce a broad range of investors to shift their investments into riskier assets. The other is that by reducing the amount of duration risk held by leveraged financial intermediaries, asset purchases create balance sheet capacity to hold other riskier assets.
In the euro area, portfolio rebalancing has been powerful, with risk premia on bonds issued by lower-rated sovereigns and firms falling measurably because of our purchases.[22]Prospects of QT might have led to a partial reversal of these effects, in particular after a long period of low interest rates.[23]
In practice, however, it is inherently difficult to distinguish such QT effects from the more direct impact of a rise in the risk-free rate on the country-specific risk premium. To the extent that sovereign bonds are risky, their yields have to rise by more than the rise in the risk-free rate to compensate investors for the increase in credit risk.[24]The larger public debt is as a share of GDP, the stronger this effect should be.
The empirical literature suggests, however, that there is no mechanical link between changes in the risk-free rate and credit risk premia. The relationship is often non-linear and highly time and state-dependent.[25]
The euro area’s experience over the past 15 months fits this pattern. The correlation between policy rate expectations in one year’s time and the spread between the ten-year GDP-weighted yield over the OIS has been far from perfect since December 2021 (Slide 14, left-hand side). There have been persistent periods during which this correlation has been weak or even negative.
Last year, for example, after the announcement of the transmission protection instrument (TPI), expectations for the future policy rate increased sharply from around 1% to 3%. Risk premia in sovereign bond markets, however, remained broadly unchanged (Slide 14, right-hand side).
These developments suggest that other factors were also at play. One of these factors is financial market participants’ attitude towards risk, over and beyond changes in expected default losses.
There is a growing literature suggesting that risk tolerance by global investors can explain a substantial portion of movements in asset prices.[26]Monetary policy, in turn, is often an important driver of risk tolerance.
This can be seen in corporate bond markets, where credit spreads can be decomposed into a component measuring firms’ expected probability of default and an “excess” bond premium.
The latter has been shown to be a powerful proxy of the risk-bearing capacity of leveraged financial intermediaries.[27]The evidence shows that changes in the excess bond premium can explain virtually all of the conditional response of credit spreads to a change in monetary policy.[28]
The reason is that monetary policy tightening typically reduces intermediaries’ risk-bearing capacity, thereby raising the compensation they require for warehousing risk, over and beyond changes in the quality of borrowers’ balance sheet.[29]
This is precisely what we have seen in the euro area. In the first half of 2022, the increase in the excess bond premium accounted for 80% of the total increase in corporate bond spreads (Slide 15). By October, it still accounted for around two-thirds of the rise in credit spreads.
The partial reversal of the portfolio rebalancing channel of asset purchases is likely to have amplified this transmission mechanism compared to previous tightening cycles.
Indeed, over the course of last year we observed significant portfolio shifts, resulting in large volumes of securities being sold in the secondary market in a short period of time.
Non-bank financial institutions, for example, have offloaded a notable part of their holdings of lower-rated corporate and sovereign bonds that they had acquired during the period of asset purchases (Slide 16, left-hand side).[30]
Regulatory constraints and internal value-at-risk measures implied that leverage-constrained intermediaries which usually absorb these sell orders were facing higher costs for holding more inventory.
As a result, intermediaries demanded higher compensation for bearing exposure to credit risk, over and above expected losses, and they reduced their intermediation capacity, resulting in higher bid-ask spreads, especially in high-yield corporate bond markets (Slide 16, right-hand side).
Put simply, QT can be thought of as QE in reverse when it comes to portfolio rebalancing – that is, QE relaxes intermediaries’ value-at-risk constraint and thereby creates space for a reallocation of portfolios towards riskier assets.[31]The end of QE, in turn, has made these constraints more binding again.
The absence of reliable empirical evidence on QT makes a quantitative assessment difficult. During QE, for example, we saw appreciable differences in the impact of purchases on yields over time, with higher effects during periods of market stress (Slide 17, left-hand side).
Although market conditions were volatile over most of last year, the effects of QT are likely to have been weaker than those of QE at the outbreak of the pandemic.
Assuming an average of stressed and non-stressed elasticities, ECB staff analysis suggests that risk premia in sovereign bond markets gradually increased as investors brought forward their expectation of the time and pace of balance sheet run-off (Slide 17, right-hand side).
Specifically, staff estimate that the APP and the PEPP had jointly compressed the ten-year GDP-weighted risk premia of the four largest euro area countries by around 180 basis points by the end of 2020.
Revisions in market expectations about the evolution of the size of our balance sheet over the coming years are estimated to have reversed around 40 basis points of this peak impact since September 2021.
Conclusion
All this suggests, and with this I would like to conclude, that portfolio rebalancing effects are relevant market drivers, both when central banks intend to expand their balance sheet and when they plan to reduce it.
Prospects of QT are therefore likely to have complemented the tightening from changes in our key policy rates before balance sheet run-off actually began, thereby contributing to a timely return of inflation to our 2% target.
Over time, balance sheet run-off will reduce our market footprint, improve market liquidity and lower the Eurosystem’s exposure to credit and duration risk, recovering valuable policy space. By how much we will ultimately reduce our bond holdings will mainly depend on the demand for central bank reserves, stemming both from autonomous factors and from the banking sector, as well as the operational framework that we intend to implement in the medium run.
Thank you."

Dow Lecture by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
London, 16 February 2023
Introduction
It is an honour to deliver this year’s Dow Lecture. Christopher Dow had a distinguished career as an applied macroeconomist, both in the United Kingdom (at the Bank of England, the Treasury and here at NIESR) and internationally (as OECD Chief Economist from 1963 to 1973).[1]Moreover, he extensively analysed my topic today – the impact of interest rate movements on the financial system, the economy and inflation – including in the context of the cost-push inflation pressures of the 1970s and 1980s.[2]While the current inflation environment is quite different in many respects – having been driven predominantly by extraordinary external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply bottlenecks and energy shocks – much can still be learned by re-visiting the analysis by Christopher Dow of the macro-financial dynamics and policy challenges associated with cost-push inflation.
My aim today is to provide an interim analysis of the ECB’s current policy rate tightening cycle.[3]I will first describe the projected impact of monetary policy in the range of macroeconomic models maintained by the ECB. Next, I will report on the accumulating evidence about the impact of the policy tightening cycle on the financial system, the economy and inflation. In view of the long and differential lags in the transmission of monetary policy, this evidence is necessarily partial and of an interim nature. Still, it is essential to monitor closely the incoming evidence, since the efficient calibration of monetary policy must take into account the feedback loops between monetary policy, the financial system, the economy and inflation.
Beginning in December 2021, the ECB unwound its highly accommodative monetary policy stance in several phases. First, the pace of net asset purchases was reduced, including through the ending of net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme in March 2022. Net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme further shifted down from April 2022 and concluded in June 2022. In July 2022, we began raising the ECB key interest rates. The €STR forward curve – the benchmark for key overnight lending in the euro area – began shifting up in December 2021, as markets began pricing in the start of ECB policy normalisation. This induced a tightening impulse even before we began raising actual policy rates.
The speed and the scale of the back-to-back rate adjustments since July stand out in the history of the monetary union (Chart 1). By now, we have raised rates by a cumulative 300 basis points, bringing the deposit facility rate – which, in the current conditions of ample excess liquidity, constitutes the main instrument for steering the monetary policy stance – to 2.5 per cent. Furthermore, we have also signalled that we intend to raise the deposit facility rate by another 50 basis points at our March meeting and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy. This evaluation will necessarily turn on two basic considerations: first, an updated assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook (both the modal path and the risks to this outlook) second, an updated assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance to make sure that inflation returns to our two per cent target in a timely manner. In turn, both parts of this assessment involve judgements on the impact of the monetary policy adjustments that have already occurred since December 2021.
Calibrating changes in the policy stance and monitoring the transmission to the financial system, the economy and inflation presents policymakers with three challenges. The first is to produce a reasonable (counterfactual) forecast of where inflation would head without an adjustment in monetary policy. The second is to develop reasonable estimates of how an adjustment in monetary policy would alter that inflation trajectory. The third is to carefully monitor each step in this transmission from monetary policy to the economy and inflation, gathering evidence along the way on how this transmission conforms with past regularities or, if it does not, to better understand how and why the specific features of the current macro-financial environment might alter the strength and speed of monetary policy transmission. It is worth pointing out that, regardless of the origin of an inflation shock, the working assumption is that monetary policy operates on the demand side, with rate hikes reducing inflation through the dampening impact of tighter financing conditions on the level of aggregate demand. Nevertheless, watching for heterogeneities in the transmission across sectors and analysing the potentially considerable and state-dependent lags in the transmission is essential and I will return to this point throughout this lecture.
In this lecture, I will leave the question of forecasting aside and focus on the latter two points: how to form a view on the typical transmission regularities, and how to cross-check them against the incoming data along the way.
Let me first review the set of models that ECB staff use to inform policy decisions and present the macroeconomic effects these assign to monetary policy. As the bulk of these effects on the economy and inflation are expected to materialise only over the coming two to three years, I will then go through a set of more timely signals that may be gathered along the way and that can act as checkpoints on the path of transmission.
To date, these signals for the most part point to a strong and orderly transmission of the ECB’s policy tightening to the relevant financial and real variables. But, especially since this transmission process is still unfolding, I will conclude with a set of open questions on the impact of the ongoing policy tightening that can only be settled conclusively at a more mature stage of the process.
The impact of hiking in macroeconomic models
At the ECB, we employ a suite of semi-structural, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) models to study the underlying transmission channels of monetary policy and to quantify the impact of changes to monetary policy on financial conditions, the economy and inflation. Drawing on a suite of models, rather than relying on a single framework, helps us draw more robust policy conclusions.
It is inherently difficult to pin down causal relations in empirical macroeconomic models and this is reflected in the wide range of estimates of the impact of monetary policy impulses on macroeconomic variables. The level of uncertainty about the impact of monetary policy is arguably greater for the euro area than for other economies, in view of the structural changes associated with the formation of the monetary union in 1999. Given this high uncertainty across models, we employ different classes of models, supplement the main models with satellite models, and add various other sources of information.
Let me now turn to some of the main models that we use and discuss how these differ in terms of their design.
The ECB-BASE model, which is similar in structure to the US Federal Reserve’s FRB/US model, is a large-scale semi-structural model that is used primarily for forecasting and policy simulations.[4]This type of model is designed to strike a balance between having strong theoretical foundations embedded in its steady-state properties and being flexible enough to be useful for a vast range of policy simulations. In particular, the semi-structural approach typically relies on a series of reduced-form equations that govern the relations among the key macroeconomic variables and allow flexibility to match the empirical data.
In addition, several structural DSGE models are regularly used in our internal quantitative policy analysis. In particular, the extended version of the New Area-Wide Model (NAWM II) is a fully micro-founded model that incorporates explicit intertemporal substitution via a forward-looking Euler equation for optimising households, a financial accelerator mechanism linking bank lending to the net worth of firms, interest-sensitive investment decisions of households and firms, and an exchange rate channel.[5]Most recently, the MMR model has been developed, which is a DSGE model sharing many similarities with the NAWM II, but which additionally estimates the degree of attention to central bank communication, thereby dampening the forward guidance puzzle encountered in standard DSGE models, and accounts for a time-varying neutral interest rate in line with the trend visible in the data over the last decades.[6]
Our modelling toolkit also includes several Bayesian VAR (BVAR) models.[7]This class of models is regularly used for forecasting and policy analysis in major central banks and international institutions.[8]Due to their ability to capture the inertial behaviour of inflation and the persistence in aggregate variables, BVAR models provide a useful benchmark to evaluate structural and semi-structural models both in terms of their forecasting performance and for what concerns the monetary policy transmission mechanism.[9]
In general, DSGE models (NAWM II and MMR) and BVAR models display a stronger impact of monetary policy on the economy than semi-structural models (ECB-BASE).[10]There are two main reasons for this. First, the identification of monetary policy shocks is typically clearer in structural models (either DSGE or structural VAR models), allowing for a narrower causal interpretation of the effects of monetary policy. This is important, since reduced-form estimates of the relations between interest rates, economic activity and inflation are plagued by the reverse causality syndrome by which, especially if demand shocks predominate, an increase in interest rates is most likely if economic activity is projected to be strong and inflation to be high. This gives rise to time-series correlation patterns by which any causal dampening impact of monetary policy on activity levels and inflation can be obscured in the data by its proximity to the strong activity and inflation data that actually triggered the policy tightening. In contrast, a structural approach in which the causal impact of monetary policy can be identified should, in principle, uncover the impact of policy tightening on activity and inflation.
Second, the micro-foundations of the optimisation decisions that form the key foundations of these structural models, and the use of model-consistent expectations, lead to more forward-looking behaviour of economic agents compared to other models, and this in turn strengthens the expectations channel of interest rate policy. This explains the stronger initial impact of monetary policy compared to other types of models.
The left and middle panels ofChart 2show the impact of a policy tightening of 100 basis points on inflation and GDP in these models.[11]Chart 2 also shows that impact of policy tightening derived from the Basic Model Elasticities (BMEs) exercise conducted jointly by the Eurosystem. The BME exercise is a euro area aggregation of simulation results provided by national central banks: these simulations are based on smaller, country-specific models that compute impulse responses of endogenous variables to exogenous shocks, linearised around a specific baseline.
All simulations are based on a tightening that has a relatively persistent effect on short-term rates. Conditional on a 1 percentage point change in the interest rate, on average inflation declines by around 0.3 percentage points and the output gap by 1 percentage point at the peaks of the respective impacts.[12]However, the range of estimates is large: the impacts on inflation and output are larger in structural models (DSGE and BVAR) compared to the ECB-BASE model and the BMEs.[13]Moreover, due to their forward-looking nature and amplification through financial channels, the effect is frontloaded in DSGE models compared to other models, since households and firms more quickly react to the expected declines in future activity and inflation associated with monetary policy tightening. In contrast, the muted initial response in the ECB-BASE model and the BMEs can in part be related to the strong backward-looking expectations formation process in these models.[14]
These estimates imply that the models generate not only different scales of monetary policy impacts but also heterogeneous lags in the timing of the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and inflation. Differences in transmission lags of monetary policy across these models arise from the specific modelling frameworks. In empirical VARs, the persistence is generally driven by the estimated autoregressive processes, in addition to the identification assumptions which impose some ordering of the flow of causality. In DSGE models, inertia is built in via microfoundations, with frictions such as habit formation in consumption, sticky or backward-looking wage and price setting, and adjustment costs in investment. Finally, semi-structural models use a combination of these empirical auto-regressive processes and economic frictions.
In addition to the lags associated with the slow and staggered adjustment of investment and consumption to changes in financial conditions, the full impact of policy rates on financial conditions is not immediate. In particular, fixed-rate loans and deposits provide some near-term insulation to changes in interest rates. However, as financial contracts expire, more and more firms and households face higher interest rates and the tightening of financial conditions is further amplified by the endogenous shortening of maturities in response to higher interest rates. This will be a recurring theme in this lecture, in particular when I turn to how the current tightening is being transmitted.
Finally, our overall policy stance is also affected by our balance sheet polices. Our models suggest that reducing our asset portfolio by a normalised cumulative €500 billion reduction over 12 quarters contributes to lowering inflation by 0.15 percentage points and output by 0.2 percentage points (Chart 2, right panel).
Tightening so far according to model estimates
Our models indicate that the significant policy tightening that we initiated in December 2021 has had substantial effects on euro area financing conditions so far, while its transmission to real activity and inflation is also starting to materialise. In discussing the transmission of our policy stance through the lens of our models, it is important to account for all factors driving that transmission collectively, including interactions with other domestic and global shocks potentially shaping macroeconomic dynamics. These factors jointly shape the magnitude and timing of the transmission to the economy. To disentangle these effects, the impact of policy normalisation is estimated by first computing the policy contribution to changes in financial conditions and then using macro models to estimate the impact on the economy and inflation.
Combining information from model-based analysis and market and survey-based information, we estimate that the tightening of monetary policy has contributed to an increase in short-term interest rates of 90 basis points in 2022, rising to around 300 basis points in 2023 and 2024, and 240 basis points in 2025, and to increases in long-term rates of around 130 basis points.[15]
This tightening is estimated to have already lowered inflation by around 0.2 percentage points in 2022 (Chart 3).[16],[17]The considerable lags between monetary policy actions and their impact on inflation, however, imply that most of the effects are only expected to materialise from 2023 onward. The impacts on GDP growth, however, occur much sooner across most models, with the peak effect expected this year. Inflation is estimated to be around 1.2 percentage points lower in 2023 and 1.8 percentage points lower in 2024 as a result of the tightening, while the negative impact on real GDP growth is estimated to be around 1.5 percentage points on average over the three years. These are sizeable effects. At one level, these estimates serve to underline the severe risks to the delivery of our medium-term target if monetary policy had been passive and had not reacted to the inflation shock. At another level, especially taking into account the wide range of estimates across the different models, material and persistent errors in the appropriate calibration of monetary policy pose two-sided risks to the delivery of our medium-term inflation target: insufficient tightening would result in inflation persistently above our target, while excessive tightening could see overshooting and a return to persistently below-target inflation. These alternative scenarios also entail substantially different profiles for the level of economic activity and, by extension, the labour market.[18]
Model-based analysis also facilitates the building of a more detailed understanding of the transmission of policy rate hikes to different components of demand. For example, recent staff analysis employing the semi-structural ECB-BASE model shows that rate hikes may induce stronger investment declines if the initial level of the policy rate is particularly low, as was the case prior to the start of our hiking cycle in July 2022.[19],[20]This result is in line with standard asset price models based on the user cost of capital, which posit a non-linear, negative relation between the level of lending rates and asset prices. Hence, in the case of business and housing investment, lower interest rates lead to larger discounting effects on future returns (dividends and imputed rents), amplifying the impact of interest rate changes on current stock and house prices.
In these simulations, shocks to lending rate spreads and risk-free rates entail a stronger reaction of both business and housing investment in the low-rate environment (0.6-0.7 percentage points and 0.4-0.5 percentage points, respectively) by 2024, compared to a scenario with higher initial levels of lending rates (Chart 4, solid bars). The model simulations confirm a role for state-dependence as obtained from non-linear local projections models.[21]However, relative to such an empirical exercise, the ECB-BASE model suggests the presence of small non-linearities, especially affecting business investment (Chart 4, dashed bars).
Finally, all model-based quantitative estimates are surrounded by significant uncertainty, inter alia because these models are calibrated to reflect historical regularities that may not apply to the prevailing conditions. Also, while the models provide a good estimate for the overall effects of policy changes on the economy and inflation, policy transmission usually unfolds in a heterogeneous manner, with the peak impact and duration of transmission varying substantially across sectors and jurisdictions. Consequently, the broad orientation delivered by the macroeconomic models needs to be complemented by a more granular set of analytical checkpoints that allow us to ascertain whether the responses to our policy measures are moving in the right direction and at the right pace. I now turn to this more granular and data-driven analysis.
Tightening impact according to market and survey information
In line with the sequence by which monetary policy passes through the transmission chain, I will start with the impact on short-term money market rate expectations.
A first indicator is the extent to which moves of our policy rates influence money market conditions. The evidence suggests that the policy rate hiking that has occurred since July last year has been passed on almost entirely to short-term money market rates, with the transmission occurring relatively smoothly across market segments and jurisdictions.
Moreover, the response of short-term money market rates has fed through to longer maturities. The €STR forward curve, which is derived from the overnight interest rate swap curve and reflects the market view on the path that the overnight interest rate will follow in the future, has shifted upwards significantly since December 2021 (Chart 5).
Whether adjusting for risk premia or not, forward rates today see a rate trajectory which, in line with our communication, rises above the range of estimates that can be considered neutral to the monetary policy stance. Conceptually, the neutral interest rate is the hypothetical level of the interest rate that, when all temporary shocks have faded out, can set the economy on a sustainable path of balanced growth with inflation durably at target. As actual rates move beyond that level, policy becomes restrictive – as is necessary when inflation is otherwise set to remain above the central bank’s target for an extended period.
That is, the monetary policy adjustment since December 2021 can be interpreted as having two elements. First, there has been an exit from an accommodative stance: this component can be viewed as essentially permanent (in the absence of a new anti-inflationary shock). This is reflected in the market pricing of the forward curve, which sees the policy rate settling around 2 per cent once inflation has stabilised at our target, rather than reverting to the low (indeed, negative) levels that were in place until last July. This long-term exit from the persistently low-rate regime reflects the reanchoring of long-term inflation expectations at our 2 per cent target and the market judgement that the anti-inflationary forces that were in place before the pandemic (such as significant deleveraging by both the private sector and the public sector after the 2008-12 financial crises and favourable global supply-side developments) will not return with the same force. Accordingly, a significant component of the rate tightening so far is essentially permanent in nature. While the associated reanchoring of inflation expectations means that the rise in real rates is less than the rise in nominal rates, the permanent nature of this component of the rate tightening amplifies its impact compared to a purely temporary increase in rates.
Second, there is an adjustment component that reflects our monetary policy response to the current high inflation. It is fully priced (in line with our expressed policy intentions) that the main policy rate (the DFR) will reach 300 basis points in March, and it is priced to rise even higher subsequently. This component (going beyond the policy rate of around 200 basis points that the market expects to prevail over the long term) can be viewed as restrictive and further adds to the tightening of financial conditions, even if it is less persistent than the normalisation component of our policy adjustment.
Sovereign bond yields, which play an important role as a key reference for bond pricing, have also shifted upwards and moved largely in lockstep with the OIS curve. The transmission of rate hikes to sovereign bond markets since the start of the hiking cycle since July has been orderly, supported to some extent by the ongoing flexible reinvestment of the pandemic emergency purchase programme, activated in early July 2022, as well as the addition of the transmission protection instrument to our toolkit in late July 2022.
Finally, the euro exchange rate constitutes a key metric of financial conditions that is available at high frequency. It is also a material driver of economic activity and inflation through a range of channels. Reflecting an earlier and more demand-driven updrift in inflation, US monetary policy changed course earlier than in the euro area, which was then also reflected in a sustained euro depreciation against the US dollar, lasting until September of last year. But as the actual and prospective interest rate differentials across the two economies were reduced, the euro has reversed some of the previous depreciation, thus confirming the functioning of another important transmission channel for the current tightening cycle (Chart 6).
The capacity of a central bank to influence the economy hinges on its ability to alter the broad monetary stance, including the terms and conditions at which the economy has access to bank-provided and market-provided finance.[22]
Bank funding costs are rising fast, and the tighter borrowing conditions that banks face today to refinance their assets are reflected in higher lending rates to firms and households. Yields on euro area bank bonds have increased by more than 300 basis points since December 2021. The higher funding costs for banks are being passed on to borrowers. For firms, the cost of borrowing from banks started trending up in early 2022 and has strongly accelerated since September, bringing it to around 3.4 per cent in December (Chart 7, left panel), while the overall cost of debt financing, which also includes the cost of issuing corporate bonds, stood at 3.7 per cent. For households, the cost of borrowing for house purchases has increased by more than 160 basis points over the course of 2022, to 2.9 per cent in December, while the rate on loans for consumption and other purposes has risen by more than 160 basis points, to now stand at almost 5.8 per cent (Chart 7, right panel). Rising costs, in turn, have contributed to a sharp reduction in debt financing flows to firms and households (Chart 8).
The tighter financing conditions for banks are also reflected in the results of the latest ECB bank lending survey (BLS) from January. Euro area banks reported a substantial further tightening of credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Chart 9), especially for housing loans and other lending to households (Chart 10). Consistent with the adverse impact of monetary policy tightening on economic activity levels, risks related to the economic outlook and industry or firm-specific situations are mentioned in the BLS as the main motives currently driving banks towards enforcing tighter credit standards.
More expensive and harder-to-obtain credit is downgrading the prospects of economic sectors that are more sensitive to financing conditions. Survey evidence for consumers and firms signals that the pass-through is ongoing and effective.
For example, consumer expectations about interest rates have shifted upward since March 2022, according to our Consumer Expectations Survey (CES). Consumers have raised their expectations for interest rates on mortgages. The interest rates expected to apply to loans for house purchases in 12 months’ time have increased by about 1.5 percentage points since the beginning of 2022 (Chart 11, left panel). In line with these developments, the CES evidence also points to worsening household perceptions about the housing market, both for perceptions of housing as a good investment and 12-month-ahead expectations for house price growth, amid tightening financing conditions. The share of respondents expecting tighter credit access (for any type of credit) peaked in October 2022 at almost one-third of survey respondents. In parallel, the share of respondents expecting to apply for a new mortgage over the next 12 months declined to 8.9 per cent in October 2022, from 10.3 per cent in April 2022. Understandably in a higher-rate environment, the likelihood of applying for mortgage refinancing (by existing mortgagors) decreased to 12.2 per cent in October 2022, from 18.1 per cent in October 2021 (Chart 11, right panel).
Households on an adjustable-rate mortgage – which accounts for roughly 8 per cent of households – are particularly feeling the bite of higher interest rates (Chart 12, left panel). Since July 2022 the share of households reporting that lower interest rates would be best for their household has begun rising, mirrored by a declining share of those preferring higher interest rates since September 2022. The upward trend is particularly visible among households with an adjustable-rate mortgage, who are most directly affected by the rise in interest rates. Conversely, households with a fixed-rate mortgage, who are not as immediately exposed to higher interest rates, hardly changed their attitude towards interest rate changes.
Expectations for spending from respondents with an adjustable-rate mortgage are also more sensitive to changes in expected interest rates. On average, respondents tend to reduce their expected real spending growth when they increase their expectations about future mortgage rates: the typical response to a 1.0 percentage point higher mortgage rate expectation is for households to cut spending by 5 basis points. But the response is in excess of 10 basis points for households on an adjustable-rate mortgage (Chart 12, right panel ).
Overall, the CES evidence suggests that consumers are incorporating the impact of higher interest rates in their economic decisions, particularly in calibrating their plans for discretionary consumption. This is to some extent already visible in the incoming hard data. Demand for consumer durables is contracting as is the demand for residential construction, driven by rising input costs and interest rates. Even if demand for non-durables should be relatively less affected by rising interest rates, retail sales dropped markedly by 2.7 per cent in December month on month, and by 2.8 per cent in annual terms (Chart 13). Overall, euro area retail sales followed a slightly negative trend in 2022, driven mainly by developments in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and, more recently, France.
Recent evidence from firm surveys provides a broadly consistent picture of rising financial constraints beginning to restrict production levels. The European Commission’s business and consumer surveys suggest that the share of firms in the manufacturing sector reporting that financial constraints are a factor limiting production has doubled to 6 per cent since the start of our policy tightening (Chart 14, left panel). This information for the manufacturing sector is broadly consistent with responses from the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), where a rising share of firms reported “access to finance” as being a very important problem for their business (defined as a score of at least seven on a scale from one to ten) compared with other potential problems (Chart 14, right panel).[23]Given the lags in transmission, a further weakening could be expected over the coming quarters.
Inflation expectations anchor inflation dynamics and co-determine real interest rates. A basic task for monetary policy is to make sure that longer-term inflation expectations align with our 2 per cent target. In addition, deviations from the target will be more prolonged and more costly if households, firms and market participants come to believe that a central bank is not firmly committed to making sure that inflation returns to the target in a timely manner. In particular, even if long-term expectations remained firmly anchored, even a temporary rise in inflation expectations over the typical monetary policy horizon of one to two years would amplify any initial inflation shock by influencing pricing and wage decisions and, all else equal, by pulling demand forward through a lowering of inflation-adjusted interest rates.
The strong downward sloping ‘term structure’ of inflation expectations in the CES suggests that consumers in the euro area continue to perceive the current spike in inflation as clearly fading out over time. They expect inflation to return closer to the levels seen in the past, albeit to remain above two per cent for some time (Chart 15, left panel). This means that, for a given level of the nominal policy rate, the monetary policy stance is expected to become more restrictive over time as inflation declines.
Indeed, measures of long-term inflation expectations from diverse sources – including household surveys, professional forecasters and financial market instruments – have so far remained well anchored around the 2 per cent medium-term target. Respondents to the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) repeatedly, over several rounds, expect inflation to decline steadily over the course this year and next, and to return to target in 2025 (Chart 16, right panel). The distribution of long-term inflation expectations has remained centred around 2 per cent (Chart 16, left panel). Financial market measures of inflation compensation have also hovered around the 2 per cent target over the medium term.
Financial markets responded strongly to the policy decisions taken by the Governing Council in our December 2022 meeting, which made clear that we would raise interest rates into sufficiently restrictive territory in order to make sure that inflation would return to our 2 per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. In particular, the reaction of market-based inflation compensation measures in response to the December communication – which saw a substantial decrease in near-term inflation linked swap (ILS) rates in line with a policy tightening effect while longer-term ILS rates remained relatively stable – is an example of how our monetary policy decisions are contributing to keeping inflation expectations well anchored (Chart 15, right panel).
Transmission compared to previous cycles
The continuous monitoring of transmission is essential to cross-check model predictions against the reality on the ground. But it becomes especially urgent when there is a distinct possibility that prevailing conditions differ in fundamental ways from the historical regularities that are encapsulated in those models.
Three factors may distinguish the current hiking cycle from previous tightening episodes. The first relates to the exceptional speed of the current hiking cycle compared to relevant precedents in recent history. The second relates to structural shifts that may have altered the transmission of a given policy impulse in the euro area. And the third factor is the implications of hiking cycles being synchronised across the major central banks.
Comparing the current hiking cycle to previous ones is challenging for three reasons. First, the current rate hiking cycle started only six months ago, with the bulk of the pipeline effects still expected to be realised over the coming months and years. Second, in order to understand how monetary policy is filtering through to the economy, it is important to consider not only the level that interest rates have reached today, but also the speed at which these have been raised over a relatively compressed period of time. The cumulative 300 basis point hike since July 2022 is the fastest rate hiking cycle in euro area history. Third, the start of the hiking cycle put an end to an era of negative policy rates and marked the first rate hike since 2011. As the available literature studying negative rates has found, pronounced non-linearities were evident in the relative impact of equally sized rate reductions depending on whether these occurred in positive or negative territory. This means that one may legitimately expect such non-linear effects to also be relevant in moving rates back into positive territory after a long period below the zero line. In other words, the rate hiking cycle may not only differ from those observed in historyquantitatively, but alsoqualitatively.
Chart 17shows that the current rate path outpaces any historical example given in the picture, at least over the earlier phases of progression for which they are comparable. That said, the path is relatively similar to two historical precedents at least (the response by the Bundesbank to the inflationary risks emanating from the German unification in the early 1990s and the rapid normalisation of policy rates by the ECB following monetary union over 1999-2000).
However, at least over the period for which we can draw comparisons, the impact of our rate hikes on lending rates and on credit volumes has been stronger and more rapid. It is interesting to note that, despite following similar trajectories over the period preceding the start of the respective hiking cycles, the evolution of total credit to firms is already showing signs of moderation, whereas it took longer for commercial credit to reach an inflection point in the other two episodes. Of course, whether these tighter conditions will succeed in sufficiently dampening demand and thereby decelerating inflation markedly is too early to conclude and remains an open issue.
Adding to the extraordinary circumstances, the ECB is not alone in its historic rate hiking cycle. Given the global drivers of the inflation surge (energy shocks, global supply chain bottlenecks), major central banks around the world have simultaneously increased interest rates at an historic pace. The common global factor is also evident in the behaviour of asset prices, with euro area asset prices having become more sensitive to US macro-economic news. Empirically, medium-term spillovers from the Federal Reserve tightening to euro area real activity and inflation are found to be large and, along some dimensions, in fact as large as the effects on the US economy itself (Chart 18). It has been and will continue to be important for central banks in their policy deliberations to not only account for the effects of their own policies but also for those of their global peers.
Structural shifts are another challenge that compels us to reassess our modelling frameworks and to augment them with further evidence on the evolution of the monetary policy transmission process. One example is the structure of private sector debt. For instance, as policy rates increase, more and more firms can be expected to opt for shorter maturity and flexible rate debt, which could magnify the impact of monetary policy on investment. Firms have already shifted their debt structure away from long maturities. In 2021, about 25 per cent of new loans had a maturity of more than one year, whereas reversion towards levels closer to those observed around 10-15 years ago, characterised by shorter maturities and more recourse to flexible rate debt (Chart 19, left panel). Further shifts might be expected in response to the current rate hiking cycle. Such behaviour could translate into a stronger sensitivity of the interest expenses of firms to monetary policy changes. This in turn means a stronger contraction of corporate cash flows when policy rates increase. Over time, firms that already face financing frictions can be affected more by this “floating-rate channel” of monetary policy, amplifying the conventional monetary policy transmission.
Financing constraints may also increase amid more elevated debt servicing costs, since default probabilities grow with a decline in expected activity levels and rising interest rates (Chart 19, right panel). Financial intermediaries judge corporates by their probabilities of default and will likely curtail credit for those borrowers deemed to be too risky: a commonly used measure of borrower risk is the one-year-ahead expected default frequencies (EDFs). In line with the Merton-type model underlying the computations, data on individual companies point to a positive relation between EDFs and net leverage. What can also be observed however – at least in some samples examined – is that the sensitivity of EDFs to net leverage also shifts upwards when debt servicing costs increase. This may suggest that an environment of elevated debt servicing costs might also translate into higher probabilities of default and thus potential increases in companies financing constraints.[24]
Moreover, firm financing structures have not only changed in relation to maturity structures, but also in terms of the relative role of different debt instruments. While firm financing remains predominantly bank-based in the euro area, bond financing has increased considerably over the last fifteen years (Chart 20). Prior to the onset of the ECB’s monetary policy normalisation, the share of bonds had reached a peak of about 30 per cent in 2021. Increases in bond financing largely reflected credit supply restrictions: after the great financial crisis and during the ensuing sovereign debt crisis, banks curtailed their credit supply to the economy and large firms used the “spare tyre” of bond markets to finance themselves.[25]Thereafter, developments were helped by corporate bond purchase programmes of the ECB and overall favourable financing conditions.
As firm financing switches from bank to bond financing, the sensitivity of economic activity to changes in the short-term policy rate can decrease, since the higher duration of bonds insulates the stock of debt from rate changes. However, at the same time, the total sensitivity to movements of the long-term policy rate and of overall yield curve might increase, via new issuance. The differences in transmission, whereby firms using more bonds are more directly affected by changes in long-term rates rather than short-term rates, reflects this fact that the typical maturity of corporate bonds is higher than for loans.[26]
Firm financing via bond markets can be fragile in a context of policy normalisation and thereby can amplify de-risking (Chart 21). As the normalisation process of monetary policy started and rates increased across the whole term structure, bond issuance dried up during the course of 2022, thus translating into a decrease in the share of bonds relative to loan. Furthermore, firm-level data suggest that the ongoing monetary normalisation is not neutral with respect to the risk profile of bond issuers, as riskier firms have more vigorously reduced their share of new bonds since June 2022. Given the greater sensitivity of bond markets to risk over this period, the role of banks in financing the economy became more prominent. More recently, the rise in bank lending rates has narrowed the gap between the cost of bond and bank finance, with some high-grade issuers returning to the bond market in January 2023. Finally, a stronger recourse to bond markets also exposes firms more directly to foreign monetary conditions, in view of the spillovers across euro and foreign-currency bond markets (Chart 22).
Finally, the change in financing structures has not been restricted to the corporate sector. Households have also begun to increase their recourse to flexible rate mortgages (Chart 23, left panel). Amid monetary policy normalisation, euro area households also tend to be more likely to initiate flexible rate mortgages than in the recent past. Recent empirical work indeed suggests that across euro area countries, those with historically higher shares of flexible rate mortgages also experienced stronger contractions of consumption following a tightening in monetary policy (Chart 23, right panel).[27]A generalised increase in the share of flexible rates of mortgages could thus translate into an amplified monetary policy transmission mechanism to consumption.
At the same time, the significant amount of excess savings amassed by euro area households during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chart 24) will continue to act as a buffer for consumption during this period of high inflation and will exert downward pressure on the price of capital. Both effects could thus dampen the transmission of higher policy rates to the economy and inflation. However, support for higher demand may only be partial: first, a large share of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic accrued to the wealthiest households with a lower propensity to consume and, second, a substantial part of the excess savings is likely to be reabsorbed via weaker borrowing dynamics and – among lower-income households – to finance the price increases for essentials like food and heating. In this context, it is also important to keep in mind that euro area households generally have lower levels of indebtedness than those in the United States, which may explain part of the difference in transmission in the euro area compared with the United States.
Another open question is the degree to which the improved capitalisation levels of euro area banks will affect monetary policy transmission.
Against the backdrop of regulatory developments, the launch of European banking supervision and enhanced market scrutiny, the euro area banking sector has become better capitalised and more attentive to the early identification of risks and vulnerabilities. Greater bank capitalisation, in theory, should allow for a smooth transmission of monetary policy to lending conditions, since the risk of a credit crunch as rates increase is reduced.[28]The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of euro area banks has increased substantially since the establishment of European banking supervision (Chart 25). This allowed them to become part of the solution during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting the euro area economy’s unprecedented need for emergency liquidity lending.
The upgrade in regulatory and supervisory oversight has led to more prudent risk management practices, contributing to tightening credit standards even in periods when the latter were eased on the back of monetary policy accommodation (Chart 26). The decrease in the riskiness of loan portfolios was accompanied by a more efficient unwinding of legacy assets (Chart 27), ensuring that the strengthening of banks’ intermediation capacity was persistent and resilient to adverse developments.[29]Even now in a context of monetary policy tightening, the additional capital buffers and prudential practices cultivated over the past decade act as a natural bulwark against an unwarranted and disorderly deterioration in financing conditions for the real economy.
The experience during the pandemic has also shown that micro and macroprudential policy measures can complement monetary policy, adding to the overall resilience of bank intermediation in the euro area. As euro area banks have adapted to the evolving regulatory and supervisory landscape, monetary policy, micro and macroprudential authorities have refined their understanding and shared experience of how the different policy areas can complement each other to achieve common goals.[30]For instance, there is evidence that capital relief measures at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic increased the effectiveness of targeted longer-term refinancing operations in supporting the flow of bank credit to the real economy.[31]
Consolidation and cost rationalisation have contributed to a sustained improvement in bank profitability, increasing the resilience of the euro area banking system and reducing the risks of an uneven transmission of monetary policy. Profitability of the banking sector influences intermediation capacity, the transmission of prudential and monetary policies, as well as the ability of firms to invest in innovative projects.
The evolution of the return on equity (ROE) of euro area banks, except for the drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is a testament to the efficiency gains achieved over the past decade, also under the impulse of supervisory authorities and market dynamics that favoured consolidation in the banking sector. In that context, the funding cost relief brought about by monetary policy easing between 2014 and 2021 bought time for banks to improve and adapt their business models to the evolving landscape, leaving them in a more comfortable position when the general level of interest rates started to rise.
A structurally more profitable banking system is inherently more resilient and less dependent on public support measures.[32]In the context of the ongoing monetary policy tightening, this will help to preserve a well-functioning bank-based transmission of monetary policy, reducing the risks that a lower risk appetite of financial intermediaries amid the cooling off of the economy may set the ground for an uneven transmission of monetary policy.
This being said, pockets of vulnerability remain, especially along dimensions that had emerged with the global financial crisis. For instance, despite the improvement in bank profitability, cost of equity measures – the return that investors demand – still lie well above the ROE, reflecting onto persistently low bank valuations (Chart 28).[33]
Finally, since 2009, the importance of banks in euro area financial intermediation has declined in favour of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). Direct lending of NBFIs to the private sector is relatively small in the broad euro area, with notable exceptions concentrated in few countries. But those institutions play a dominant role in holding both sovereign and corporate bonds and their balance sheet has steadily increased since the global financial crisis (Chart 29). Hence, the reduction in the relative role of loans over bonds (Chart 20) has translated since the global financial crisis into a diminished importance of banks in monetary transmission compared with NBFIs. Recent research demonstrates that monetary policy transmission via traditional banks and NBFIs differs in non-trivial ways, but remains effective in the face of a changing monetary toolkit and evolving central bank mandate.[34]This has been reflected well in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy review.[35]
Beyond the changes in financing structures, changes to the broader macroeconomic environment in recent years may have an impact on the transmission of our monetary policy.
One example is that a large and growing share of gross value added (GVA) in the euro area is generated in the service sector (Chart 30, left panel).[36]Given the lower capital intensity of services relative to construction or goods production, the service sector may be less sensitive to monetary policy, implying a weaker interest rate channel of transmission. This hypothesis is borne out by recent empirical evidence subdividing regional GVA into its capital- and labour-intensive components (Chart 30, right panel). This breakdown shows that the peak impact of an exogenous change in policy interest rates on capital-intensive output is double the peak impact on labour-intensive output. But the contraction in the latter seems to be more persistent, which, together with complementary pieces of evidence, points to some labour market hysteresis that prolongs the real effects of monetary policy.[37]Whether these patterns have intensified during the years since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out remains an open issue, as the drop in activity in the service sector related to lockdown measures in 2020 and 2021 was largely compensated during the reopening of the economy in 2022. Furthermore, if the increasing role of intangible assets for firm revenues – with a growing role for e-commerce and substantial innovations in the pharmaceutical industry being prime examples – turns out to be a persistent trend, it could support higher interest rate sensitivity, since an increasing role of intangible assets means equity valuations may turn out more sensitive to interest rate changes than in the past.
Conclusion
In summary, our monetary policy decisions are best served by relying on a broad analytical toolkit. Macroeconomic models provide orientation on how a given monetary policy adjustment should typically affect the economy and inflation, and how the transmission process unfolds, including lags in transmission. But, in tracking the dynamic impact of a policy impulse to its ultimate effects, we also need to constantly monitor progress and update our assessments of how the transmission mechanism is operating under current conditions, with due accounting for the specific configuration of the prevailing financial and economic conditions.
Applied to the current euro area context, this dual approach leads to an interim assessment that our monetary policy actions are clearly tightening financial conditions, reducing credit volumes and altering the behaviour of households and firms.[38]At the same time, much of the ultimate inflation impact of our policy measures to date is still in the pipeline. Over time, our monetary policy will make sure that inflation returns to our target in a timely manner.
But I have also listed some of the sources of uncertainty about the transmission mechanism that call for an open mind about the precise scale of the monetary policy tightening that will be needed to achieve this outcome. Furthermore, as indicated in the introduction, the calibration of the monetary policy stance needs to be regularly reviewed in line with the incoming information about underlying inflation dynamics, especially in the context of the remarkable shocks that have hit the euro area and global economies over the last couple of years. The Governing Council’s data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to setting interest rates is well suited to facilitating the necessary ongoing analysis of these issues."

Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an event organised by the Centre for European Reform, the Delegation of the European Union to the United Kingdom and the ECB Representative Office in London
London, 16 February 2023
It is a pleasure to be with you here in London today.
The energy shock stemming from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has prolonged and aggravated a sequence of unprecedented supply shocks.[1]These shocks, combined with the reopening of the economy after the pandemic, have driven inflation in the euro area to persistently high levels.[2]
To prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, the ECB tightened its monetary policy stance decisively. We needed to avert second-round effects in the form of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations or a wage-price spiral.
We started to adjust our stance in December 2021[3]. Since July we have increased rates by 300 basis points. We have also started to normalise our balance sheet, which has shrunk by about €1 trillion since its peak. And from March we will reduce our asset purchase programme holdings by an average of €15 billion per month[4].
After this pronounced tightening, we need to carefully reassess the medium-term outlook for inflation and the risks surrounding it. In this respect, risks to the inflation outlook are now more balanced than at the time of our projections in December.
The economic environment is changing. Supply shocks have started to reverse, with energy and food commodity prices receding from their peaks last year and supply bottlenecks easing. It will take time for this to be fully reflected in retail prices across the economy and ultimately in core inflation.
We also face formidable sources of economic and geopolitical uncertainty globally. And major central banks are tightening their monetary policy stance simultaneously, the overall effects of which are difficult to assess.
In the euro area, market rates have increased significantly and bank lending is decelerating sharply. While housing and business investment has already weakened, the effect of our monetary policy impulses on domestic demand will only be felt in full over the coming quarters.
In this setting, I will argue that the ECB should not unconditionally pre-commit to future policy moves. Instead, we need to calibrate our monetary policy in a way that is data-dependent, forward-looking and adaptable to changing developments.
This approach can be best implemented by providing clarity on our monetary policy reaction function and then being guided by that reaction function in our decisions. We should respond to incoming information on the medium-term inflation outlook and the balance of risks surrounding it. And we should keep our policy tight until we see inflation firmly converging back to 2% over our policy horizon, taking into account the lags with which our monetary policy operates.
When we were normalising rates the pace of adjustment was key. But with rates now moving into restrictive territory, it is the extent and duration of monetary policy restriction that matters. By smoothing our policy rate hikes – that is, moving in small steps – we can ensure that we calibrate both elements more precisely in the light of the incoming information and our reaction function.
This framework will allow us to return to our target without undue delay. And it will allow us to do so at minimal cost to the economy and employment, reducing the risk that we tighten too much.
The uncertain economic environment
The current uncertain economic environment makes forecasting inflation particularly challenging.
The medium-term inflation outlook was revised substantially upwards in our staff projections last December. Headline inflation was projected to stand at 3.4% in 2024, before falling to 2% in the third quarter of 2025 (Chart 1). And core inflation was expected to remain above target throughout our horizon, declining to 2.4% on average by 2025. The risks to this outlook were primarily on the upside.
But key assumptions underpinning economic projections can change quickly. In fact, recent surveys and the latest European Commission forecast see headline inflation significantly below our December projections for 2024.[5]And risks have become more balanced.
Let me now review the key factors making projections difficult in the current environment.
Energy inflation has slowed more than projected in December. As a result, headline inflation is also falling: in January it was well below what we expected in December, driven by the energy component (Chart 2). If the drop in energy prices is sustained, headline inflation may fall below 3% towards the end of the year.
The deceleration in headline inflation is particularly visible from indicators of inflation momentum, which may be more informative than the usual year-on-year inflation rate when inflation is changing rapidly.[6]These indicators are also showing signs of deceleration in core inflation (Chart 3).
Wholesale electricity and gas prices are currently lower than assumed in the December projections, pointing to a continued decline in energy inflation. And wholesale energy prices will affect all inflation components as they remain the largest driver of both goods and services inflation (Chart 4).
Core inflation has been less affected by the fall in energy prices so far. This is not surprising, as energy typically has a gradual and indirect impact on the price of goods and services through changes in the cost of inputs. For example, the cost of offering goods will over time benefit from lower transportation costs. Similarly, the cost of producing food will benefit from lower fertiliser costs, and the cost of providing hospitality services will benefit from lower heating costs.
Core inflation cannot turn on a dime, and the speed at which lower energy prices will pass through to core inflation is uncertain. If lower energy prices strengthen consumer demand, the pass-through could be slower as firms seize the opportunity to increase margins. At the same time, over the past year we have seen more frequent price adjustments, which could make downward price rigidities less binding. In any case, the direction of core inflation will eventually follow that of headline inflation, just like what happened on the way up.
Lower energy prices will help to temper core inflation through other channels too.
For example, improving terms of trade due to lower energy prices have contributed to the euro’s appreciation both directly[7]and indirectly by supporting the growth outlook (Chart 5). In turn, the appreciation of the euro against the dollar – by 12% from the through in September and 4% since the December projections – further reduces the cost of dollar-denominated commodities and other inputs imported in the euro area[8].
Moreover, current developments alleviate the concerns that high energy prices could lead to a loss of potential output and thus exacerbate inflationary pressures[9]. I recently argued that this was still a conjecture rather than a fact.[10]But if energy prices continue to fall, potential output will prove more resilient.
In my view, even though we need to be cautious as energy prices are highly volatile, recent developments in energy markets have made the risks surrounding the inflation outlook more balanced.
One major factor behind the upward revision to the December inflation projections for 2024-25 was the assessment made by Eurosystem staff about thefiscal measures taken since 2022 to attenuate the impact of the energy shock.
The projections foresaw that the price-based measures – introduced or announced by governments in order to contain changes in consumers’ purchasing power over time – would reduce inflation this year. The projections also reflected the expectation that the bulk of these measures would be withdrawn next year, increasing inflation by 0.7 percentage points in 2024 and generating significant carry-over effects for 2025. And this delayed the moment at which inflation was projected to return to our 2% target, with important implications for our monetary policy decisions. Moreover, according to the projections, most of these measures would not be limited to vulnerable population groups, potentially creating an expansionary impulse for demand.
As I argued recently[11], this risked creating a highly inefficient interaction between monetary and fiscal policies. Fiscal measures that were introduced to protect consumers’ purchasing power might paradoxically trigger a contractionary monetary policy reaction that would hit the real economy, reducing household incomes and increasing the interest bill for governments. This would be like giving with one hand and taking away with the other.
This assessment of the inflationary effects of the fiscal measures is however surrounded by high uncertainty. Discretionary fiscal spending is hard to predict accurately, and the measures could be adjusted to avoid inefficient interactions with monetary policy. Indeed, some governments have announced that they may reduce spending on energy price brakes or move to more targeted income-based measures. Moreover, falling energy prices are likely to imply that energy support measures will be less extensive than foreseen in the December projections. This is also contributing to the rebalancing of risks to inflation.
Another factor that drove up our projections was wage growth. As workers sought compensation for high inflation, we expected wages to accelerate. This robust wage dynamic boosted the baseline projection and the risks surrounding it, as accelerating wages coupled with a tight labour market could raise the spectre of a wage-price spiral.
Wages are still a source of upside risk. In the seven countries covered by the ECB’s wage tracker, recently concluded agreements signal that wage pressures are rising (Chart 6), albeit remaining consistent with the December projections.
But so far there is no convincing evidence that inflation expectations are de-anchoring, which is a necessary condition for a wage-spiral to take hold. Survey evidence suggests that consumers expect inflation to moderate over the medium term.[12]And longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored.[13]
The upside movement in wages might reflect a one-off rebalancing in the income distribution between workers and firms. Workers have so far borne the brunt of the “Putin tax”, suffering a large loss of real income while, on balance, firms’ mark-ups remained stable or even increased in some sectors.[14]Ultimately, the “tax” will be absorbed by the factors of production – labour and capital – in proportion to their respective bargaining power in the labour market.
Moreover, lower energy prices limit workers’ loss of real income, thereby containing their drive to seek compensation through higher wages. And lower energy bills reduce input costs, allowing firms to better absorb wage increases without having to raise prices in response. In this way, we could see strong one-off wage growth but limited aggregate “cost-push” effects that raise core inflation.
All in all, higher wage increases do not necessarily signal a persistent divergence from our 2% inflation target. But we cannot rule out that stronger and sustained wage dynamics will take hold if above-target inflation proves to be persistent. I consider this risk broadly unchanged compared with the December projections.
The same supply shocks that are rebalancing the risks to inflation are also rebalancing the risks to growth.
Since December, economic activity and labour markets have proven more resilient than expected. And the outlook may improve further as lower energy prices support the economy and economic confidence in the current context of robust job growth. That could reduce the downside pressure on the prices of core goods and services.
These positive developments could be partly counterbalanced by the appreciation of the exchange rate and the tightening of credit conditions observed in recent months. And macro-econometric models may only partially capture the contractionary effects of our sizeable monetary policy tightening.[15]
There is also high uncertainty surrounding the international environment. While the US economy is decelerating, its labour market has recently surprised on the upside. In China, the exit from zero-COVID policy has led to a wave of infections that have adversely affected the economy, but the outlook is expected to improve as the economy reopens. More broadly, global demand and supply remain difficult to predict in view of geopolitical unknowns and the synchronised tightening by major central banks across the world.[16]
In short, the next steps facing monetary policy are anything but obvious.
A data-dependent monetary policy with a clear reaction function
So how should policy respond to this environment?
There are times when it makes sense to commit to a specific future course of monetary policy action – this is what we call forward guidance. That is the case when the economy faces deflationary risks and interest rates are at their lower bound.[17]And it can also be true when faced with inflationary risks: if the outlook changes rapidly and the monetary stance becomes clearly inappropriate, the commitment to normalise policy rates quickly is key to anchor inflation expectations.[18]
But today we are in a different situation. Monetary policy has already made a sizeable adjustment, and we now face inflation uncertainty in both directions. Moreover, we are not constrained in using interest rates to return to our target.
Forward guidance is therefore unnecessary. In fact, it would be tantamount to tying our own hands at a time when the inflation outlook can change rapidly.
In such circumstances, a truly data-dependent approach to calibrating monetary policy is preferable since it enables us to react nimbly to the incoming data. And it gives us enough time to see how our decisions affect the wider economy – a process that is hard to assess today.
Given the extent and speed of our tightening so far, there is a question mark over just how fast and how strong its effects on the economy will be.
Very early evidence suggests that bank lending rates are increasing more quickly than in previous hiking cycles, in line with the steeper increase in policy rates. And lending to firms and households is decelerating rapidly (Chart 7).
But given the long lags with which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy,[19]most of the effects of our tightening are still ahead of us. This means, for example, that the current adjustment in the credit market –involving higher loan rates, as well as tighter lending standards and lower demand for loans to firms and households (Charts 8 and 9) – will likely compress consumption and investment in the coming months.
In the light of this, we increasingly need to consider the risk of overtightening. After many years of low growth, tipping the economy into a full-scale recession could trigger a permanent destruction of productive capacity and harm future employment opportunities, especially for the vulnerable members of society. Even if subsequently corrected, such overtightening would be very costly, given the low flexibility of the European economy.[20]
Overall, monetary policy needs to react forcefully when major shocks hit the economy and push inflation in a clear direction. But when risks are more balanced, a data-dependent approach is a prerequisite to avoiding costly mistakes.
For such a data-dependent approach to be effective and avoid exacerbating uncertainty, we need to give some guidance on our future policy. Although we should avoid giving unconditional forward guidance on the policy rate path many months ahead, a meeting-by-meeting approach alone may not suffice. It may leave investors in the dark, having to guess our future moves and focusing on the near term[21].
To deal with this conundrum, we must instead provide investors with a framework for how we evaluate and respond to the incoming information. In other words, we need to clarify our reaction function.
In line with our price stability mandate, our reaction function is informed by the inflation outlook as well as the risks surrounding it. And it is designed to ensure that inflation returns to 2% without undue delay, taking into account the lags with which our monetary policy operates.
A proper understanding of this reaction function can benefit from two important clarifications.
The first iswhatwill contribute to determining our reaction – that is, the set of factors that will affect inflation the most at our medium-term policy horizon[22].
At the global level, the most significant of these factors are energy prices, simply because lower energy prices are crucial for current inflationary pressures to unwind.
As for the domestic economy, a key factor in the coming months will be how rapidly lower energy prices and the associated lower cost pressures for firms are passed on to retail prices. In this respect, we need to carefully monitor mark-ups and wage growth, which could push in the opposite direction; for wages, we need to distinguish one-off adjustments from generalised increases, which could trigger self-sustaining wage-price rises. The conditions in the credit market are also important: we need to assess how fast credit to the economy is contracting and what its effects are on consumption and investment.
Second, we need to clarifyhowwe should react to new information.
Last year, the need to normalise monetary policy quickly from a very accommodative starting point placed emphasis on the pace of rate hikes to prevent inflation becoming entrenched.
But now that we have made a major policy adjustment, theextentanddurationof restriction have become increasingly relevant. By smoothing our policy rate hikes – that is, moving in small steps – we can ensure that we calibrate these two elements more precisely, remaining truly data-dependent and avoiding mistakes. This means that we will need to act in a non-mechanical way, keeping a genuine forward-looking approach and avoiding overreacting to individual data points.
We also need to ensure consistency across our tools. It is natural to normalise the size of the balance sheet in a tightening phase, thereby making it “push” in the same direction as our interest rate policy. But we are in unprecedented territory, and the pace of normalisation should be gradual and prudent, with rates remaining the key instrument to steer our monetary stance. There is little reliable experience of balance sheet tightening. It is hard to assess how a contraction of our balance sheet will affect bond markets and financial stability – especially if it happens in conjunction with an abrupt increase in interest rates.
What we do know is that we must preserve the singleness of our monetary policy by ensuring that our policy impulse is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. We should remain committed to all our lines of defence, which reinforce each other. First, a measured approach to hikes and balance sheet normalisation. Second, the flexibility embedded in our reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme. And third, the Transmission Protection Instrument.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The energy shock has coincided with the post-pandemic reopening of the economy to result in persistently high inflation in the euro area.
That in turn has increased the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and inflationary wage-price dynamics. In response, we have tightened our monetary policy decisively to prevent inflation becoming entrenched in the economy.
But as policy rates move more firmly into restrictive territory and the energy shock abates, the risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced. And the outlook for the economy and inflation has become increasingly uncertain, both globally and in the euro area.
In this environment, we no longer need to overweight upside risks to avoid worst-case scenarios. We now need to take into account the risk of overtightening alongside the risk of doing too little.
A data-dependent calibration of monetary policy – firmly rooted in a clear reaction function – offers the best way forward. It will enable us to clarify our policy intentions, providing markets with the necessary guidance while keeping volatility in check. In parallel, by smoothing our policy moves we ensure that their cost to the economy is minimal.
This doesn’t mean we willnotbe resolute in the fight against inflation. It means being resolutein the right direction. What we do not want is “to drive like crazy at night with our headlights turned off” – as Italian singer Lucio Battisti once put it.[23]
Thank you."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the plenary session of the European Parliament
Strasbourg, 15 February 2023
I am very pleased to be back here in this plenary room – the heart of European democracy – to participate in today’s important debate.
The ECB was granted a democratic mandate to ensure price stability in the euro area. In other words, we safeguard one of the fundamental conditions for stable economic growth.
To achieve this mandate, the ECB was also granted a high level of independence. And as you acknowledge in the draft resolution we are discussing today, the ECB’s ability to take all necessary measures – free from political interference – is essential for it to deliver on its mandate.
This is particularly important in the current environment. High inflation continues to have a large impact on all areas of our economy and on people’s everyday lives – especially on low-income households, as you also note.
This is why the Governing Council started a process of policy normalisation in December 2021 and raised the ECB interest rates by 300 basis points since July 2022. At its February meeting, the Governing Council emphasised its determination to stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.
But independence also comes with a great deal of responsibility – the choices we make as central bankers have a significant influence on society. So being accountable for our decisions is the necessary counterweight to our independence.
This means that we need to explain our policies, and the analysis that underpins them, to ensure that people understand how our decisions are taken. But it also means that we must be attentive to the concerns of the public and carefully evaluate whether and how we can respond to these concerns within our mandate. After all, reinforcing trust in our institution also supports our monetary policy, for example by anchoring inflation expectations.
Today’s debate on your draft resolution is crucial in both these aspects. I am here today to explain our policies, but also to listen to your views as elected representatives of European citizens, and to further reflect on how the ECB can act for the benefit of all Europeans.
The euro area economy
Let me start by briefly outlining our assessment of the euro area economy, as discussed by the Governing Council earlier this month.
Euro area growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2022. The outcome was better than we had initially expected, as the adverse economic effects from Russia’s unjustified war were partly buffered by improving supply conditions and fiscal support related to the energy crisis. While confidence is rising and energy prices have fallen, we expect activity to remain weak in the near term.
According to Eurostat’s flash estimate – calculated using Eurostat estimates for Germany –, inflation was 8.5% in January.[1]The decrease compared with December was mainly due to a sharp drop in energy prices. At the same time, the prior surge in energy prices and other input costs is still feeding through to consumer prices. Overall, price pressures remain strong and underlying inflation is still high – excluding energy and food, it remained at 5.2% in January.
Looking at the labour market, wages are growing faster, supported by robust employment dynamics, with the main theme in wage negotiations becoming how wages can to some extent catch up with high inflation. And even though most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2%, these measures warrant continued monitoring.
The risks to the growth outlook are now more balanced than they were in December. Russia’s war against Ukraine and its people continues to be a significant downside risk, but a faster resolution of the energy shock would support growth. The risks to the inflation outlook have also become more balanced, especially in the near term.
The ECB’s monetary policy
Against this backdrop, at our latest meeting on 2 February we decided to raise the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and we expect to raise them further. In view of the underlying inflation pressures we intend to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at our next meeting in March, and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy.
Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.
At our February meeting, we also decided on the modalities for reducing the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet under the asset purchase programmes (APP). As communicated in December, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, with the decline amounting to €15 billion per month on average from the beginning of March to the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace to be determined over time.
In the interest of simplicity and neutrality, the parameters for reducing the APP portfolio will be closely in line with what we have done previously. This will preserve consistency with our monetary policy stance being set primarily by our interest rates. For the Eurosystem’s corporate bond purchases, reinvestments will be tilted more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance, supporting the gradual decarbonisation of our corporate bond holdings in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement – without prejudice to our price stability objective.
The euro area – an attractive club
Let me now turn to other important matters you have raised in your draft resolution: the expansion of the euro area and the work we must do to complete our Economic and Monetary Union.
On 1 January, we welcomed Croatia to the euro area – expanding our club from 19 countries to 20. Croatia’s accession is an impressive achievement, not only for Croatia itself, but also for the euro. It shows that the euro is still an attractive currency and once again reminds us that in Europe we are stronger together.
Adopting the euro will bring tangible benefits to Croatia’s four million citizens, building on the broader positive impact the euro has had over the last two decades. As an anchor of stability, the euro has advanced European integration and strengthened the Single Market’s role in driving growth. This, in turn, has elevated the EU’s standing as the world’s largest trading bloc and enhanced our autonomy on the global stage.
The euro has also become a binding symbol and integral part of our shared European identity, as its popularity shows. Support for the euro and for Economic and Monetary Union has now reached an all-time high of 80%.[2]
But with rising geopolitical tensions in the global economy[3], a stable euro will become even more important in ensuring that Europe continues to thrive. And for that to happen, we need to double down on the work that remains to complete our Economic and Monetary Union.
Here, every European policymaker needs to contribute. Let me mention three areas where progress can be made in the next 12 months before the EU elections in 2024.
First, work on strengthening euro area financial integration needs to proceed.
The ECB is playing its part, notably by ensuring European banking supervision is effective and consistent. And we promote financial integration through our central bank services, for example by supporting EU debt securities issuance to fund the Next Generation EU programme.[4]
However, the future of EU capital markets hinges on the broader regulatory environment − which is in your hands. Deeper, more integrated EU capital markets are essential for enhancing risk-sharing and mobilising the private financing needed for the green and digital transitions.
By the same token, we must not overlook the crucial work remaining for the completion of the banking union – an issue highlighted in your draft resolution and on which this Parliament has been vocal in pushing for progress.
Second, the reform of the EU economic governance framework needs to move forward.
The ECB has highlighted the importance of a simpler and more predictable framework, stronger national ownership and sustained implementation.[5]I encourage EU policymakers, including this Parliament, to rapidly reach a viable and broadly shared agreement that strengthens the foundations of our Economic and Monetary Union.
Third, an appropriate regulatory framework for the digital euro needs to be laid down.
The digital euro project is a truly European initiative which is moving ahead at a steady pace. In the autumn, the ECB’s investigation phase will come to an end and the Governing Council will decide on the next steps. But let me be clear: that does not mean that we will then issue a digital euro. That would only happen at a later stage, based on a dedicated decision, and only after the Parliament and the Council of the EU have adopted the legislative act. All EU policymakers should continue playing their part, and I am counting on this Parliament to swiftly start working on the legislative proposal which the European Commission intends to publish in a few months.
Conclusion
Let me now conclude.
We are committed to bringing inflation back to our 2% medium-term target, in line with our mandate, and we will take the necessary measures to do so.
But as Thomas Jefferson once wrote, “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance”.
In a democratic society, central bank independence can only be legitimate if it is founded on a clear mandate and balanced with accountability to ensure that the central bank follows its mandate. This also means that forceful efforts to ensure price stability need to be accompanied by equally forceful democratic scrutiny.
In this spirit, we will continue our ongoing dialogue with you as the representatives of EU citizens. As also advocated in your draft resolution, the ECB stands ready to agree on a formalisation, in writing, of the current accountability practices between the ECB and the European Parliament. The ECB has made a proposal to the European Parliament and looks forward to finalising an agreement between our two institutions.
Thank you for your attention. I am now looking forward to listening to your views during today’s debate."

Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the Deutsche Börse Annual Reception in Eschborn
Eschborn, 23 January 2023
Introduction
It is a pleasure to speak with you here in Eschborn, marking the start of the New Year.
A new beginning often brings with it new challenges, but it also presents us with plenty of opportunities. And today I would like to touch on both.
Looking at today’s global economy, I am reminded of the playwright and poet Bertolt Brecht, who once observed: “Because things are the way they are, things will not stay the way they are.”
The global economy finds itself at a crucial turning point. Last year, we began to see the emergence of a “new global map” of economic relationships – one in which geopolitics is increasingly influencing the global economy.[1]
And that in turn has important implications for Europe, which will define the year ahead.
A changing world
This map is defined by three interrelated factors: shocks, supply, and security.
First, with support for an open global trading order on the wane, we are facing new types of shocks to the global economy. For the past few decades, open trade has supported global growth by allowing countries to “rotate” demand during slumps.[2]But now it could become a source of volatility.
That is because the rise of international free trade – and the stability that comes with it – has historically depended on the backing of a global hegemon. This was evident during the British Empire in the 19thcentury, as it was with American support in the wake of the Cold War.[3]
However, major economies – led by the United States and China – are now increasingly using trade to limit the ambitions of geopolitical rivals. That could fragment world trade with potentially huge costs. The IMF estimates that severe trade fragmentation may cost global output roughly 7% in the long term – an amount similar to the annual output of Japan and Germany combined.[4]
These geopolitical winds are reshaping the second feature of this new map: supply. We are seeing strategic considerations becoming increasingly important in where suppliers are located.
The US Inflation Reduction Act, for example, is deliberately aimed at “reshoring” production and reducing the country’s reliance on strategic imports like batteries.[5]China is also seeking to reduce its own dependence on the rest of the world. And some surveys suggest that even firms in “non-strategic” sectors are increasingly likely to regionalise their supply chains.[6]
This in turn is leading to the third key feature: the growing importance of security. With the security of supply for critical inputs no longer guaranteed, we are likely to see a new “scramble for resources”.
Russia’s unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine has brought supply security back to the top of the agenda for all major economies, most saliently for energy. And over the longer term, it is likely to accelerate the global transition to clean energy production as a way to increase climate and energy security.
But such technologies are highly resource-intensive in their installation phase. Getting the global economy on a path to meet the Paris Agreement goals could see total mineral demand from clean energy technologies quadrupling by 2040.[7]This threatens a new era of competition for resources.
Challenges for Europe in 2023
As this new global map takes shape, we enter 2023 facing three big challenges.
The first challenge is to reconsider how we can best protectEurope’s critical interests in a fast-changing world. As an economy that is very open to trade and deeply integrated into global supply chains, we are vulnerable to geopolitical headwinds. For example, 35% of Europe’s manufacturing output is absorbed outside the EU, much more than for the United States or China.
So, as the next chapter in the globalisation story is being written, we need to ensure that Europe is a leader, not just a follower. And as the French President and German Chancellor have recently argued, we have the capacity to do so.[8]
Already now, Europe is the top trading partner for 80 countries, compared to just over 20 countries for the United States.[9]That gives us unique bargaining power to shape openness in a European direction and strengthen ties with key partners, such as those on whom we rely for critical resources.
And where we see our interests being threatened, we can use our economic weight more strategically – something we have already started to see with the unprecedented sanctions placed upon Russia.
But we must also be prepared for a future in which the global economy could fragment. And the best insurance against a more uncertain world is building more resilience at home. So, the second challenge for Europe is to develop more our own sources of growth.
Here, the new global map presents Europe with an opportunity.
As energy security becomes imperative, we can put climate-related investment needs – especially in clean energy – at the centre of our growth model, strengthening domestic demand. These investment needs will amount to almost half a trillion euro on average per year until 2030.[10]
We can also use the green transition as a spur to digitalise the European economy, since digital technologies could reduce global emissions by one fifth by 2050.[11]That could increase productivity growth and help ensure that green investment does not put excessive pressure on prices.
But the ambitions of this new growth model will require an enormous amount of financing. And here the financial sector can play a crucial role, if the enabling policies are put in place.
Completing Europe’s capital markets union (CMU) will be key to financing the green and digital transitions. Equity investors tend to have a greater appetite than banks for high-risk, high-return projects and equity finance tends to increase green innovation.[12]But the full and swift implementation of the Commission’s ambitious CMU Action Plan will be crucial here.
Some progress is being made. The Commission has recently put forward proposals on harmonising national insolvency laws and facilitating public listing. It is also tackling issues that have held back the growth of European capital markets, like putting equity financing on an equal tax-footing with debt financing. And Europe’s recent agreement on a minimum level of taxation for large corporates will support tax harmonisation within the EU, the absence of which has often been seen as a barrier to capital market integration.[13]
The third big challenge facing Europe is the high inflation environment. And this, of course, is the challenge that concerns me the most.
Inflation in Europe is far too high, partly due to our vulnerability to the changing geopolitics of energy. Decoupling from Russia last year pushed up energy inflation in the euro area to extraordinary levels.
But while energy inflation has recently been coming down, underlying inflation continues to rise. As a result, it is vital that inflation rates above the ECB’s 2% target do not become entrenched in the economy.
We must bring inflation down. And we will deliver on this goal.
In less than half a year, we have raised the ECB interest rates by 250 basis points, the fastest increase in our history. And we have made it clear that ECB interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive, and stay at those levels for as long as necessary.
In other words, we will stay the course to ensure the timely return of inflation to our target.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The transition from one year to the next is traditionally associated with quiet reflection, when we take stock of things that have come to pass. But as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke once wrote: a new year is “full of things that have never been”.
As we head into 2023, a changing world brings with it new challenges, but also opportunities. And let there be no doubt: with more self-confidence, more assertiveness and the right policies in place fuelling green and digital growth, Europe can adapt and thrive.
But some things never change: namely, the ECB’s commitment to price stability. We will play our part in Europe’s next chapter by bringing inflation back to our 2% target.
Thank you."

Introductory statement by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament
Brussels, 23 January 2023
Our investigation into a digital euro started more than a year ago.
Closely involving the European Parliament in the investigation phase has been a priority for the ECB from day one.
Over the course of 2022, we regularly discussed key design options in this Committee.[1]Your views provided valuable input to our work and, together with the feedback from other public and private stakeholders[2], allowed us to make steady progress.
Such interactions are essential in ensuring that public money addresses the preferences and needs of citizens and businesses in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
People’s payment behaviour is changing at an unprecedented speed: over the past three years, cash payments in the euro area have dropped from 72% to 59%, with digital payments becoming increasingly popular (Chart 1).[3]In the Netherlands and Finland, for example, cash is used only in one fifth of the transactions. At the same time, people appreciate the option to pay with public money. Most see it as important or very important to always have that choice.
A digital euro would respond to this growing preference for electronic payments by making public money available also in digital form. Together with cash, a digital euro would offer Europeans access to means of payment that allow them to pay everywhere in the euro area, free of charge. Being easily accessible and convenient to use would support adoption and financial inclusion.
In my remarks today I will discuss how the digital euro could help enable us to use our money whenever, wherever we need it throughout the euro area.[4]
I will conclude my remarks with the work agenda for 2023, when we will conclude our investigation phase and the European Commission will present its legislative proposal.[5]
The ECB is at the global forefront of the efforts by central banks to design state-of-the-art digital payment solutions for both retail and wholesale transactions.[6]
Payments are part and parcel of everyday life: we all usually carry at least one payment instrument, be it coins, banknotes, a credit card or a mobile phone.
Our priority for the digital euro project has always been clear: to preserve the role of central bank money in retail payments by offering an additional option for paying with public money, including where this is not possible today, for example in e-commerce.
The digital euro would not replace other electronic payment methods, or indeed cash. Rather, it would complement them. And by doing so, it would safeguard our monetary sovereignty while strengthening Europe’s strategic autonomy.
The initial releases would focus on enabling access to the digital euro for euro area residents, namely consumers, firms, merchants and governments.[7]
A digital euro should be easily accessible and usable throughout the euro area, like cash today. We believe this would be best achieved with a digital euro scheme.[8]By providing a single set of rules, standards and procedures, a scheme would allow intermediaries to develop products and services built on a digital euro.
The scheme would also ensure that citizens can always access certain core services, no matter which intermediary they have their account or wallet with.[9]
The digital euro would be a public good. It would therefore make sense for its basic services to be free of charge – for example when using the digital euro to pay another person, as is the case for cash.[10]
But on top of the basic services, people could choose to make use of any additional services offered by participating intermediaries on a voluntary basis.[11]
Conditional (or programmable) payments are often mentioned as one such innovative service – however, there is some confusion about the term, and this may raise concerns.
Our definition of conditional payments is that people could decide to authorise an automatic payment where pre-defined conditions of their own choosing are met.[12]For example: the payer could decide to set an automatic monthly payment in digital euro to pay their rent.[13]But the payee would not face any limitations as to what they can do with this money they receive every month.
We believe supervised intermediaries, who are in direct contact with users, are best placed to identify use cases for conditional payments and any other advanced payment services.[14]
But let me be clear: the digital euro would never be programmable money. The ECB would not set any limitations on where, when or to whom people can pay with a digital euro. That would be tantamount to a voucher. And central banks issue money, not vouchers.
We are also aware of some people’s concerns that a digital euro could harm the confidentiality of their payment data.
When it comes to the central bank, we propose that we do not have access to personal data.[15]
And it will be for you, as co-legislators, to decide on the balance between privacy and other important public policy objectives like anti-money laundering, countering terrorism financing, preventing tax evasion or guaranteeing sanctions compliance. On our side, we have been working on solutions that would preserve privacy by default and by design, thereby giving people control of their payment data.[16]To this end, we are also closely engaging with the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board.
As public money, a digital euro would be a European public good which all citizens and firms should be able toaccessandusewithout barriers. This should be the case regardless of who their intermediary is or which Member State they are located in.
Offering universal accessibility and usability would be key for a digital euro to play its role as a monetary anchor and to fulfil people’s expectations. Feedback from citizens[17]reflects the value of having a payment instrument which is always an option for the payer. Citizens may not always pay with cash, but they like to always have the option to do so. The same logic applies to a digital euro.
As co-legislators, you can adopt regulatory measures that would ensure widespread acceptance of the digital euro in payments while ensuring that citizens have broad access to the digital euro.
But while these two factors are vital foundations for the digital euro, they alone are not sufficient. Attractive functionalities and convenient user experience would be equally key for widespread adoption.
We therefore want to design a digital euro with online and offline functionalities. These will allow it to serve different use cases[18]and offer users different benefits. For example, an offline functionality[19]would give payments a level of privacy that is close to that of cash. It would also increase resilience as it would work without internet access.
We are also envisaging two options for conveniently using a digital euro.
First, supervised intermediaries could integrate the digital euro into their own platforms. In this way, users could easily access the digital euro through the banking apps and interfaces they are already familiar with.
Second, the Eurosystem is considering a new digital euro app[20], which would include only basic payment functionalities performed by intermediaries. The app would ensure that no matter where you travel in the euro area, the digital euro would always be recognised and you would be able to pay with it.
The first releases are likely to offer contactless payments, QR codes and an easy way to pay online.[21]As the technology evolves, other forms of payment may become available in the future. When it comes to the hardware, people could pay either with mobile phones, physical cards or possibly other devices like smartwatches.
A convenient user experience requires close cooperation with all sections of the market: consumer groups who know best about consumer needs; intermediaries who would provide services to their customers; and merchants who want to offer a convenient payment solution.
We have started work on the digital euro scheme rulebook[22]to ensure a harmonised and user-friendly solution that works everywhere in the euro area.[23]
Let me conclude with the work agenda for the next months.
We will continue our investigation phase in 2023 and regularly involve this Committee in our work.[24]
Together with the European Commission, we are still analysing a possible compensation model for the digital euro. In parallel, we are reviewing all the design options to bring them together in a high-level design for the digital euro in the spring.
We are also finalising our prototyping[25]work and seeking input from the market to get an overview of options for the technical design of possible digital euro components and services.[26]
I will discuss all these topics with you in the upcoming months, before the Governing Council endorses any design and distribution options.
In the autumn our investigation phase will come to an end. Only at that point will the ECB Governing Council decide whether to move to the realisation phase.
Let me emphasise, once again, that moving to the realisation phase does not mean issuing the digital euro. During this phase we would develop and test the technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to eventually provide and distribute a digital euro, if and when decided.
The possible decision by the Governing Council to issue a digital euro would be taken at a later stage and only after the Parliament and the Council of the EU have adopted the legislative act.
The digital euro project is a truly European initiative. And it is not just a technical project: it has a clear political dimension in view of its broad societal implications. All European policymakers must thus play their part, bearing in mind our respective roles and mandates. And we must always seek broad support from European citizens.
I thus look forward to further fruitful cooperation with European co-legislators and I am personally committed to continuing our regular exchanges in this Committee.
I now look forward to your questions."
167,2023-01-10,Isabel Schnabel,Monetary policy tightening and the green transition,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230110~21c89bef1b.en.html,"Monetary policy tightening and the green transition
Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the International Symposium on Central Bank Independence, Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm
Stockholm, 10 January 2023
The green transition will fundamentally transform our societies.[1]Protecting our planet requires unprecedented large-scale investments in technical innovations and renewable energies to bring our economies on a path towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
As our experience over the past two decades demonstrates, the relatively large upfront costs incurred in these capital-intensive expenditures are particularly susceptible to changes in the cost of credit. Low and declining interest rates have measurably contributed to the fall in the “levelised cost of electricity”, or LCOE, of renewable energies.[2]As a result, the cost of electricity from renewable sources is now comparable to, or lower than, that of conventional power plants.[3]
These developments now risk being reversed by the marked rise in global interest rates over the past year. Since fossil fuel-based power plants have comparably low upfront costs, a persistent rise in the cost of capital may discourage efforts to decarbonise our economies rapidly.
Put simply, renewable energies are more competitive when interest rates are low.[4]While simulations suggest that the LCOE of a gas-fired power plant would change only marginally if discount rates were to double, that of offshore wind could rise by nearly 45% (Slide 2).[5]Widening credit spreads may exacerbate these effects in many developing and emerging economies.
The insight that the effects of interest rate changes are not symmetric across economic sectors is not new and it is empirically well-documented.[6]The exceptionally high stakes involved in the green transition, however, have sparked a controversial public debate about whether the current monetary policy tightening may ultimately slow down the pace of decarbonisation.
Some argue that such tightening may even be inconsistent with the objective of price stability: unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut rapidly, our economies will remain exposed to the risks of “climateflation” and “fossilflation” – that is, persistent inflationary pressures associated with more frequent natural disasters and a continued dependency on gas, oil and coal.[7]
These concerns must be taken seriously. As they expose a potential dilemma directly relating to central banks’ primary mandate of price stability, we cannot ignore them on legal grounds.
It is therefore no surprise that climate change features prominently in a symposium on central bank independence. Independence grants central banks significant leeway in their actions. But it also requires central banks to be held accountable – a point that Stefan Ingves highlighted in a speech last year.[8]We need to justify the course of action that we consider as most appropriate in achieving our mandate.
This is what I intend to do in my remarks today. I will argue that failing to arrest high inflation in a timely manner would jeopardise the green transition more fundamentally, and that a restrictive monetary policy stance today will benefit society over the medium to long run by restoring price stability.
I will also stress that fiscal policy needs to remain in the driving seat and accelerate the green transition, and that the decline in the ECB’s balance sheet as part of our monetary policy tightening requires us to make additional efforts to align our actions with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
Green transition can only thrive with price stability
Over the past year, we have moved forcefully to contain inflation by first stopping net asset purchases and then by raising our key policy rates by a cumulative two and a half percentage points. We have also announced that the Eurosystem will no longer reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities in the asset purchase programme (APP).
We judge that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.
As interest rates rise, financing investments in green technologies will become more expensive, generating the risk that higher costs of capital may slow down the pace of decarbonisation. There are, however, three interrelated reasons why tighter financing conditions are the appropriate response to the challenges we are facing today.
First, current high inflation is a tax on investment. In many countries, it raises the user cost of capital by raising the effective tax rate on business investment.[9]High inflation also increases uncertainty and distorts relative price signals relevant for investment decisions. And it may slow down productivity growth, as occurred in the United States in the 1970s.[10]
Therefore, the green transition would not thrive in a high inflation environment. Price stability is a precondition for the sustainable transformation of our economy.
Second, inflation will not subside by itself.
What started as a relative price shock has gradually morphed into a broad-based increase in the general price level. Preliminary inflation data for December point to a persistent build-up of underlying price pressures even as energy price inflation has started to subside from uncomfortably high levels.
To resolve today’s inflation problem, financing conditions will need to become restrictive. Tighter financing conditions will slow growth in aggregate demand, which is needed to reduce the upward pressure on prices that has resulted from the long-lasting damage to the euro area’s production capacity inflicted by the energy crisis.
By bringing aggregate supply and demand back into balance, we will accelerate the process by which inflation will fall back to our 2% target and thereby ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored.
Third, the experience of the 1970s shows that a policy that is falsely calibrated on the assumption that inflation will decline by itself could ultimately put the green transition more fundamentally at risk.
In this case, monetary policy would need to raise interest rates even more forcefully to restore trust in the economy’s nominal anchor. In the 1970s, financing conditions tightened to an extent that made capital accumulation prohibitively expensive.
Our current policy is calibrated to avoid such very bad outcomes.[11]A determined reaction to the risk that inflation may become entrenched not only safeguards price stability but also provides the conditions under which the green transition can thrive sustainably.
Indeed, while the cost of credit has become more expensive because of our actions, financing conditions remain favourable from a historical perspective. Measures of real long-term interest rates, for example, which matter most for green investments, remain low in historical comparison (Slide 3).
Accordingly, a large majority of leading climate economists polled last year see only a mild or very mild impact of rising borrowing costs on the transition to net zero emissions by 2050.[12]
So far, there is also no evidence of funding shortages for green investment projects. While conventional bond and equity funds have experienced a sizeable decline in net inflows in 2022, the same was not true for environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds (Slide 4, left-hand side). ESG equity funds have even seen sustained inflows.
Such portfolio rebalancing has made green investments relatively more attractive from a funding perspective. In the case of German government bonds, for example, the yield of a green bond compared with that of a conventional bond with similar characteristics has declined, implying that the “greenium” has reached record levels in absolute terms (Slide 4, right-hand side).
Recent research also warns firms not to delay the transition as nominal interest rates rise. ECB staff document a positive relationship between the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a firm’s operations and credit risk estimates.[13]That is, firms that do not actively reduce their carbon footprint will face higher risk premia and hence higher borrowing costs at any level of risk-free interest rates.
All this means that it would be misleading to use tighter financing conditions as a scapegoat for further delays in the green transition. By bringing inflation down in a timely manner, monetary policy restores the conditions that are necessary for the green transition to thrive.
Fiscal policy needs to accelerate the green transition
In this environment, fiscal policy needs to remain in the driving seat when it comes to fighting climate change. Regrettably, many governments failed to use the past years of low interest rates to accelerate investments in greener and more sustainable energy carriers at a pace commensurate with the challenges we are facing.
Hence, the largest impediment to a rapid decarbonisation is not the cost of capital, but rather the considerable lack of progress by governments in implementing prior climate commitments.
The OECD, for example, estimates that global fiscal support for the production and consumption of coal, oil and gas almost doubled in 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has almost certainly led to a further increase in inefficient fossil fuel subsidies to ensure short-term energy security.
Governments must end the reliance on fossil fuels as quickly as possible. They should step up their efforts at a time when average interest costs – thanks to the long period of low interest rates and the extension in bond maturities – are still projected to remain below growth rates for some time to come, thereby supporting their capacity to foster private and public investments.[14]
Viable support schemes for renewable energies and green technologies, such as first-loss guarantees, interest rate subsidies and government-sponsored financing facilities, should be continued and expanded where feasible.
Unlike untargeted, broad-based transfers and fossil fuel subsidies that distort incentives, such measures are welcome from a monetary policy perspective: their positive impact on the economy’s productive capacity will help both restore price stability over the medium term and support debt sustainability by boosting potential growth.[15]
Several structural measures are equally important.
One is acomprehensive use of carbon prices to spur substitution away from fossil fuels. All else equal, a higher LCOE of renewables requires a higher carbon price to preserve incentives for decarbonisation.
Removing red tape is another area where action is urgently needed. At present, administrative bottlenecks prevent that the rollout of renewables happens at a pace that is consistent with reaching climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest.
Finally, governments should reinforce their efforts to deepen capital markets and create a green Capital Markets Union. ECB research has long shown that stock markets are more effective than banks in supporting the decarbonisation of the economy.[16]
Yet, EU equity markets remain fragmented and often illiquid. Reliance on bank lending at a time of rising constraints on banks’ balance sheets considerably reduces the set of options for firms to push ahead with their green agenda.
The European Commission’s recent package of legislative measures, including the proposed harmonisation of key aspects of corporate insolvency law and the removal of red tape for companies to list and raise capital on public exchanges, is an important step in the right direction.[17]
But further decisive steps are needed to fast-track the establishment of a European green capital markets union.[18]
The ECB needs to intensify its efforts to support the green transition
While governments need to accelerate their efforts to put the economy on a path towards net zero emissions, the drastic change in the macroeconomic and financial environment over the past year also requires central banks to review the scale and scope of their own contribution to the green transition.
Without prejudice to the ECB’s primary mandate of price stability, we are obliged to support the EU’s general economic policies in line with our secondary objective. We must therefore ensure that all of the ECB’s policies are aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
Over the past few years, we have embarked on a demanding journey to make our monetary policy framework climate change-proof. In 2021, we decided on a comprehensive and ambitious set of measures as part of our first climate change action plan and we have begun to deliver on those commitments.[19]
We have started to integrate climate change considerations into our macroeconomic models. We will soon publish new experimental statistical indicators related to climate change. And we will increasingly address climate risks in our risk control and collateral frameworks, including by eventually making climate-related corporate disclosures compulsory for bonds to remain eligible as collateral in our refinancing operations. The Eurosystem itself will start to disclose the climate change-related exposures of parts of its own balance sheet around the end of the first quarter of this year.
Moreover, we are now tilting our corporate bond portfolio towards issuers with better climate scores, with a view to removing the existing bias towards emission-intensive firms.[20]
Although our current actions in relation to climate change are ambitious, they are still falling short of the Paris objectives as they are not sufficient to ensure a decarbonisation trajectory that is consistent with carbon neutrality of our operations by 2050.
Three areas, in particular, require additional efforts.
First, the ongoing decline in our balance sheet will visibly diminish the effect of some of our actions going forward.
For example, for our corporate bond portfolio we are following aflow-basedtilting approach where we adjust our reinvestments of corporate bonds based on a climate score that reflects issuers’ carbon intensity, their decarbonisation plans and the quality of their climate-related disclosures.
Our main steering tool in this process is the tilting parameter – that is, the weight we put on the climate score in our benchmark allocation for new purchases. However, the tilting parameter lost part of its punch when we decided to stop net asset purchases (Slide 5). The forthcoming reduction in reinvestments will further significantly constrain the ability of a flow-based approach to decarbonise our corporate bond portfolio at a pace that is consistent with our climate ambitions.[21]
The decarbonisation of our corporate bond portfolio depends not only on our tilting parameter but also considerably on the rate at which the firms in our portfolio decarbonise their businesses.[22]
For example, assuming full reinvestment, we would achieve only half of the total decarbonisation of our corporate bond holdings by 2030 if firms were to stop taking steps to decarbonise their activities (Slide 6, left-hand side). This effect depends to a significant extent on the actions of a few high-emitting companies (Slide 6, right-hand side).
Together, this implies that by ending our reinvestments, the speed of decarbonisation of our portfolio would slow down substantially and be largely out of our control.
A flow-based tilting approach is thus insufficient to achieve our goal. The Paris Agreement requires a stable decarbonisation trajectory in our portfolio irrespective of our monetary policy stance or companies’ individual actions.
We therefore need to move from a flow-based to a stock-based tilting approach for our corporate bond portfolio. This means that, absent any reinvestments, actively reshuffling the portfolio towards greener issuers would need to be considered.
At the same time, we should not divest completely, at least not initially, from those companies whose actions are particularly important in managing the green transition, but rather foster incentives for them to reduce emissions further.
The stock-based approach would also have to apply to other private asset classes in our portfolio, namely covered bonds and asset-backed securities. That requires a framework for assessing the climate impact of such exposures.
The second question is how to put our public sector bond holdings, which currently account for around half of our balance sheet, on a Paris-aligned path.
Aligning our large public sector bond holdings with the objectives of the Paris Agreement is proving challenging for a variety of reasons. First, purchases of sovereign bonds are guided by the capital key, which limits the scope for tilting strategies based on countries’ carbon intensities. Second, there is not yet a reliable framework in place to assess the extent to which sovereign bond portfolios are aligned with the Paris Agreement. And, finally, the amount of green sovereign bonds is still limited, in particular when compared with the size of our current bond portfolio.
Finding options for overcoming these constraints within our mandate is critical: any attempt to green the stock of our bond holdings needs to include a solution for our sovereign bond portfolio, in particular in the light of the review of the ECB’s future operational framework, which is likely to imply a larger steady-state balance sheet, potentially including a structural bond portfolio.
At present, there are two options to make our sovereign bond portfolio greener in a timely manner.
One is to increase the share of bonds issued by supranational institutions and agencies. A considerably larger fraction of their outstanding bonds is already green (Slide 7).
Tilting our purchases towards green bonds issued by supranational institutions and agencies would be in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and would not conflict with the requirement to be guided by the capital key.
The second, complementary option is to steadily reshuffle our sovereign bond portfolio towards green bonds as governments expand their supply of green bonds over time.
Finally, we need to intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. As a first step we will limit the share of assets issued by entities with a high carbon footprint that can be pledged as collateral by individual counterparties when they borrow from the Eurosystem. We will also consider climate-related risks when determining haircuts for corporate bonds.
But these measures will have only a small impact on the overall collateral provided by our counterparties. A systematic greening of the ECB’s collateral framework is therefore an important tool to ensure that all of our monetary policy actions are aligned with the Paris Agreement, especially in an environment in which we have started shrinking our balance sheet, as this reduces the set of options available to support the green transition during the current tightening cycle.
Green targeted lending operations, for example, could be an instrument worth considering in the future when policy needs to become expansionary again, provided the underlying data gaps are resolved. But they are not an option for the immediate future given the current need for a restrictive monetary policy.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Many central banks globally are responding to current high inflation by tightening financing conditions. While a higher cost of credit will make the financing of renewable energies and green technologies more expensive, it would be misleading to use higher interest rates as a scapegoat for a further delay in the green transition, for two main reasons:
First, restoring price stability in a timely manner provides the conditions under which the green transition can thrive sustainably. And second, the largest barrier to a rapid decarbonisation remains the lack of progress by governments in implementing prior climate commitments.
Governments must remain in the lead in accelerating the green transition. By promoting green technologies and renewable energies, they will enhance the productive capacity of the economy and thereby help restore price stability over the medium term.
In line with our mandate, we stand ready to further intensify our efforts to support the fight against climate change, building on the achievements of our climate change action plan.
Our long-term goal is to make sure that all our monetary policy actions are aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This means greening our stock of bond holdings, including public sector bonds, as well as our lending operations and collateral framework.
Greening monetary policy requires structural changes to our monetary policy framework rather than adjustments to our reaction function.
Restoring price stability through an appropriate monetary policy today will benefit society over the longer run and will facilitate the transition to a greener economy.
Thank you."

Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 25th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference
Washington, D.C., 14 November 2024
Over the past few years, monetary policy has had to change course in an unprecedented way. Faced with persistently low inflation, central banks in many advanced economies had lowered policy rates to record low levels and bought significant amounts of assets to bring inflation back to target.
When the pandemic hit and inflation surged as our economies reopened, central banks responded by raising policy rates sharply to restore price stability and anchor inflation expectations. They also started to gradually reduce their balance sheets, further removing policy accommodation.
Although the fight against inflation has not yet been won, with domestic price pressures remaining high, it is time for central banks to start reflecting on the lessons that can be learned from these episodes of low and high inflation.
My main message today is that, in a volatile macroeconomic environment, central banks need to be more agile, meaning they should draw primarily on instruments that can be reversed quickly and that allow monetary policy to be adjusted swiftly to changing economic conditions.[1]
Central banks cannot rely on stable macroeconomic relationships
Since the pandemic, the macroeconomic environment has changed in three important ways.
First, the recent surge in inflation showed that large and persistent inflationary episodes are not confined to the past, when central banks had not yet adopted inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policy.
Large inflation outbursts can occur even when central banks have a clear mandate and a strong commitment to achieving price stability.[2]
With the benefit of hindsight, the long period of low and stable inflation during the great moderation was the result not only of good policies but also of good luck, in the sense that the shocks hitting our economies were, on balance, disinflationary.[3]Today, this balance may have changed signs.
The change in the macroeconomic landscape is also reflected in financial markets. While inflation risk premia had become negative in the years before the pandemic, they started to rise already in the second half of 2020 and returned to positive territory in 2022 (Slide 2, left-hand side).
In the same vein, we have seen a shift in the Survey of Professional Forecasters. In the pre-pandemic period, the distribution of inflation expectations was skewed to the downside. In the high inflation period, the distribution shifted markedly to the right, showing a fat, right-hand tail. And then, as inflation slowed, it became more balanced (Slide 2, right-hand side).
So, within a few years, we may have moved from a regime of chronically low inflation to one where adverse supply-side shocks dominate – owing, for example, to the growing fragmentation of the global economy or climate change. This may give rise to upside risks, as some of the factors that had contributed to low inflation during the 2010s may now be working in the opposite direction.
Second, the level of the natural rate of interest, or r* – the real short-term rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary – has become more uncertain.[4]
Before the pandemic, a secular decline in productivity growth and an ageing society had put downward pressure on r*.[5]In recent years, however, the range of model-based estimates of the natural rate of interest has moved upwards in tandem with market-based measures (Slide 3, left-hand side).[6]
Whether real interest rates will ultimately be higher than during the 2010s depends critically on how our society addresses the structural challenges it is currently facing.
If firms and governments are serious about fighting climate change and making the euro area economy more competitive, private and public investments will need to rise measurably so that capital deepening and higher productivity growth offset the drag from an ageing society on potential output and real interest rates.
Given the global nature of r*, the future level of real rates will also depend on changes in the supply of savings and the demand for investments in the rest of the world. A global surge in investment in response to digitalisation, decarbonisation and deglobalisation would raise r*, while higher global uncertainty in an era of geopolitical shifts may have the opposite effect.
This uncertainty about the level of r* is reflected not only in the wide range of estimates across different models but also in the even larger parameter uncertainty within models (Slide 3, right-hand side).
The latter has recently increased notably. For example, according to the frequently used Holston-Laubach-Williams model, the 68% confidence interval for the estimate of the euro area’s current natural rate has a width of almost 12 percentage points around its point estimate.
Given this uncertainty, central banks need to be prepared for all scenarios.
Third, before the pandemic, a wide range of research suggested that the Phillips curve had flattened considerably, implying a weaker relationship between economic slack and inflation.[7]
Today, there is increasing evidence across major economies that the slope of the Phillips curve is highly state-dependent.[8]When marginal costs increase rapidly and threaten to erode profit margins, firms tend to raise their prices more frequently, as seen in past years (Slide 4, left-hand side).[9]
More recently, however, firms have started absorbing a substantial part of the increase in their marginal costs – mainly reflecting strong wage growth – in their profit margins, causing the frequency of price increases to slow measurably. This change in the pass-through of marginal costs to prices also reflects the success of monetary policy in restoring the balance between supply and demand.
Research has also shown that, beyond certain levels of labour market tightness, the relationship between inflation and economic slack can change (Slide 4, right-hand side).[10]In the United States, for example, the number of job vacancies exceeding the number of unemployed workers was accompanied by a rapid surge in inflation, resulting in a steepening of the Phillips curve.[11]
A state-contingent or non-linear Phillips curve implies that conditions can change quickly if a large shock hits the economy.
A reassessment of policy tools
All this suggests that the macroeconomic environment in which central banks are operating today has become more uncertain and more volatile. In a world more prone to shocks, the inflation regime can shift quickly, real equilibrium rates can move up or down and macroeconomic relationships like the Phillips curve can become highly unstable.
One key takeaway from this increase in volatility is that monetary policy needs to be more agile. It needs to be able to change course quickly when circumstances change.
However, not all policy tools are equally agile. The experience of the past few years suggests that some instruments can be unwound quickly, while others have more persistent effects on financial markets and the economy.
I see three lessons from the episodes of low and high inflation for central banks’ toolkits.
First, policy rates clearly pass the agility test.
The recent tightening cycle is a case in point. Raising policy rates quickly has proven highly effective in reigning in inflation by dampening the growth in aggregate demand and anchoring inflation expectations. This has helped dispel any doubts about central banks’ determination to fight inflation and fears of them being subject to fiscal dominance.[12]
Our approach to adjusting policy rates was in line with the outcome of our 2021 monetary policy strategy review, in which we confirmed that policy rates are our main policy instrument. Constraints on reacting swiftly are usually self-imposed in the form of forward guidance.
Being able to change course quickly also suggests that negative policy rates, which are more controversial, remain a useful policy instrument should we become constrained again by the zero lower bound.
While negative rates come with undisputable costs, they can be a powerful instrument for easing the policy stance when inflation is too low. Most notably, breaking the zero lower bound allows central banks to shift the entire distribution of the expected future interest rate path, thereby providing more policy accommodation when needed.[13]
And when the tide changes, this accommodation can be quickly removed, as it was in July 2022 when the ECB unwound negative rates in just one step, raising the deposit facility rate (DFR) from -0.5% to 0%.
Second, asset purchases need to be used more cautiously and selectively.
Asset purchases are a powerful tool for stabilising financial markets during periods of stress. When markets dry up as intermediaries pull back from market making, central banks can quickly provide liquidity and instil confidence, thereby restoring market functioning.
Stabilising financial markets typically requires only short-lived interventions. During the pandemic, for example, systemic stress in the euro area receded rapidly once the ECB started making purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) (Slide 5, left-hand side).
In particular, use of the PEPP’s flexibility, allowing – if necessary – for deviations from the ECB’s capital key, which serves as a benchmark for allocating government bond purchases in the euro area, turned out to be limited and transitory (Slide 5, right-hand side).
Similarly, during the liability-driven investment (LDI) crisis in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England purchased assets over just 13 trading days and began unwinding the portfolio six weeks later. Holdings were fully unwound after a few weeks without causing any market dysfunction.
Hence, asset purchases used for financial stability purposes also pass the agility test, if calibrated and communicated appropriately. Then, purchases can be limited in volume and unwound quickly, which also helps limit moral hazard. They therefore need to remain part and parcel of central banks’ toolkits.
This is particularly important in the euro area, which has been prone to fragmentation and has therefore introduced tools, such as the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), to ensure a smooth transmission across the entire euro area.
The assessment is less clear for asset purchases conducted for quantitative easing (QE) when central banks buy bonds to lower long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Experience shows that, in this case, purchasing volumes have to be considerable for central banks to compress the term premium to an extent that affects prices and activity.
For the euro area, for example, ECB staff estimate that between January 2015 and the end of 2018 purchases worth €2.6 trillion were needed to lower euro area five-year sovereign yields by only 0.8 percentage points.[14]
The past few years have demonstrated that such purchase volumes can come with significant costs.
One such cost is the constraint put on central banks when policy needs to change course.
Large bond holdings cannot be reversed quickly. If quantitative tightening proceeded at the same pace as quantitative easing, there would be the risk of absorption bottlenecks and a sharp rise in interest rates that could undo the effects on activity and inflation for which asset purchases were made in the first place. It could also disturb the smooth transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.
In other words, quantitative tightening (QT) imposes a certain gradualism on central banks, as asset holdings can be built up much faster than they can be shrunk.
This has several implications.
One is that it may entail losses for central banks.
When central banks need to raise interest rates in the pursuit of their price stability mandate, interest rate risk materialises, causing large losses on bond holdings. While these losses need to be viewed against the gains made during the purchasing phase, there can be a hit to credibility, even if central banks are not profit-maximising institutions. Depending on the accounting treatment, losses can materialise over a long period of time.
Another implication relates to the impact on the monetary policy stance. As bond holdings can be unwound only gradually, asset prices will remain distorted for a long time.
We saw this occur during the most recent tightening cycle. Term premia remain compressed and risk premia in many asset markets stand at the lower end of the historical distribution, potentially distorting risk-taking behaviour (Slide 6, left-hand side and middle).
For monetary policy, this could mean that central banks needed to raise policy rates more forcefully to compensate for the persistent effects of bond holdings on long-term interest rates. Indeed, scaled by the magnitude of rate hikes, the tightening in financial conditions seems to have been more muted than in previous episodes (Slide 6, right-hand side).
So, what does this imply for the use of QE in the future?
In short, it means that the bar for starting QE should be higher than in the past. There needs to be a clear threat to medium-term price stability for central banks to activate large-scale asset purchases.
In particular, we need to better understand to what extent an extended period of inflation that is moderately below target risks a de-anchoring of inflation expectations that could unleash a truly harmful deflationary spiral.
Downward price and wage rigidities imply that it probably requires a significant shock for low inflation to turn into outright deflation. This can be seen when looking at the pricing behaviour of firms.
Despite persistently low inflation during the 2010s, the share of industrial firms planning to reduce prices was limited and about the same as before the global financial crisis, and the net balance of selling price expectations remained positive on average (Slide 7, left-hand side).
Households, on balance, also did not expect deflation in the low inflation period following the global financial crisis, with the net balance of inflation expectations remaining positive throughout (Slide 7, right-hand side). At the peak, just 5% of households expected prices to fall during the 2010s.
Therefore, should monetary policy in the future be once again constrained by the effective lower bound, central banks would need to carefully assess whether the benefits of QE really outweigh the costs, which often only materialise after a considerable delay.
The ECB’s experience highlights that there are other tools, such as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), that are effective in stimulating bank lending and therefore growth, and can be unwound significantly faster (Slide 8).
The third lesson is that forward guidance must not excessively tie policymakers’ hands.
In the pre-pandemic years, explicit forward guidance signalling a “low-for-longer” policy was effective in providing additional stimulus when needed at the effective lower bound.[15]
But forward guidance is useful only when macroeconomic volatility is low – that is, when the risk of central banks having to renege on previous commitments is limited.
In a high-volatility world, by contrast, forward guidance almost mechanically implies that central banks either take the risk of falling behind the curve or take a course of action that is inconsistent with their previous guidance.[16]
Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, forward guidance, including on the sequencing of the use of policy tools, was arguably one reason why central banks initially reacted too slowly to emerging price pressures, before they changed course sharply.
As forward guidance acted as a credible coordination device for investors, the markets in December 2021 still expected rates to remain negative for the foreseeable future, despite the marked rise in inflation (Slide 9).
In today’s volatile environment, forward guidance is therefore of limited use to central banks. And even if conditions changed in the future, implying a return to a low-inflation, low-volatility world, central banks should only communicate about the likely future direction of monetary policy in a “Delphic” way, that is, conditional on how the economy evolves.
Importantly, the conditions should be formulated in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner to account for the uncertainty around the inflation and economic outlook.
Let me conclude.
In recent years, the macroeconomic landscape has become considerably more volatile. To effectively manage inflation in this environment, central banks need to prioritise agility and flexibility when choosing their instruments in the pursuit of their mandate.
Short-term interest rates therefore remain the instrument of choice in most circumstances.
Asset purchases have proven to be a powerful tool for market stabilisation, while their cost-benefit ratio is less favourable when it comes to stimulating the economy near the effective lower bound. QE should therefore be used more cautiously in the future. Other tools, such as TLTROs, have been effective in reviving bank lending and can be reversed more quickly.
Our recent experience has also taught us that central bankers should be careful not to tie their hands too much by providing explicit forward guidance. In a volatile macroeconomic environment, they should remain agile and retain the ability to change course quickly when circumstances change.
Thank you."

Despite persistently low inflation during the 2010s, the share of industrial firms planning to reduce prices was limited and about the same as before the global financial crisis, and the net balance of selling price expectations remained positive on average (Slide 7, left-hand side).
Households, on balance, also did not expect deflation in the low inflation period following the global financial crisis, with the net balance of inflation expectations remaining positive throughout (Slide 7, right-hand side). At the peak, just 5% of households expected prices to fall during the 2010s.
Therefore, should monetary policy in the future be once again constrained by the effective lower bound, central banks would need to carefully assess whether the benefits of QE really outweigh the costs, which often only materialise after a considerable delay.
The ECB’s experience highlights that there are other tools, such as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), that are effective in stimulating bank lending and therefore growth, and can be unwound significantly faster (Slide 8).
The third lesson is that forward guidance must not excessively tie policymakers’ hands.
In the pre-pandemic years, explicit forward guidance signalling a “low-for-longer” policy was effective in providing additional stimulus when needed at the effective lower bound.[15]
But forward guidance is useful only when macroeconomic volatility is low – that is, when the risk of central banks having to renege on previous commitments is limited.
In a high-volatility world, by contrast, forward guidance almost mechanically implies that central banks either take the risk of falling behind the curve or take a course of action that is inconsistent with their previous guidance.[16]
Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, forward guidance, including on the sequencing of the use of policy tools, was arguably one reason why central banks initially reacted too slowly to emerging price pressures, before they changed course sharply.
As forward guidance acted as a credible coordination device for investors, the markets in December 2021 still expected rates to remain negative for the foreseeable future, despite the marked rise in inflation (Slide 9).
In today’s volatile environment, forward guidance is therefore of limited use to central banks. And even if conditions changed in the future, implying a return to a low-inflation, low-volatility world, central banks should only communicate about the likely future direction of monetary policy in a “Delphic” way, that is, conditional on how the economy evolves.
Importantly, the conditions should be formulated in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner to account for the uncertainty around the inflation and economic outlook.
Let me conclude.
In recent years, the macroeconomic landscape has become considerably more volatile. To effectively manage inflation in this environment, central banks need to prioritise agility and flexibility when choosing their instruments in the pursuit of their mandate.
Short-term interest rates therefore remain the instrument of choice in most circumstances.
Asset purchases have proven to be a powerful tool for market stabilisation, while their cost-benefit ratio is less favourable when it comes to stimulating the economy near the effective lower bound. QE should therefore be used more cautiously in the future. Other tools, such as TLTROs, have been effective in reviving bank lending and can be reversed more quickly.
Our recent experience has also taught us that central bankers should be careful not to tie their hands too much by providing explicit forward guidance. In a volatile macroeconomic environment, they should remain agile and retain the ability to change course quickly when circumstances change.
Thank you."

In 2023 the ECB consolidated progress in its fight against inflation in the euro area. The year began with headline inflation still close to record highs. The negative effects of earlier supply and demand shocks, while easing, were still driving up prices. But two key developments paved the way for inflation to decline sharply during the year.
First, the effects of the past shocks began to fade. Energy prices, which had spiked as a consequence of Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine, fell steeply, and global supply bottlenecks further eased. The drop in energy prices, in particular, accounted for half of the decline in inflation in 2023. Second, the ECB continued to tighten monetary policy, which helped to lower inflation further by dampening demand. Altogether, from January to September, we raised interest rates by an additional 200 basis points.
In doing so, we continued to follow a data-dependent approach to rate decisions given the highly uncertain environment. To calibrate accurately how far rates needed to rise, we introduced three criteria: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. By September, we saw the inflation outlook improving and monetary policy being transmitted forcefully. But underlying inflation remained elevated and domestic price pressures were strong.
We decided on this basis that the key ECB interest rates had reached levels that, if maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to our target. At the same time, we committed to holding rates at these levels for as long as necessary, while continuing to follow a data-dependent approach, based on the same criteria, to determine the appropriate level and duration of restriction.
In parallel, we advanced the normalisation of the Eurosystem balance sheet to ensure it remained consistent with our overall stance. It fell by over €1 trillion in 2023, with a large part of this decline due to maturing and early repayments under our targeted longer-term refinancing operations. We also concluded reinvestments under our asset purchase programme as the year progressed. And, in December, we announced the gradual phasing-out of reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme.
While we were consolidating progress in the fight against inflation, we advanced our work on taking account of climate-related risks within our tasks. In March we published the first climate-related financial disclosures of the Eurosystem’s corporate sector holdings. The carbon intensity of our corporate asset reinvestments fell by around two-thirds in the 12 months from October 2022 when we had started tilting them towards issuers with a better climate performance.
In 2023 we saw considerable progress in another area crucial for our work: payments. We launched our new T2 wholesale payment system in March. T2 contributes to the harmonisation and efficiency of Europe’s financial markets, introducing a new real-time gross settlement system – which replaces the TARGET2 system that had been in operation since 2007 – and streamlining liquidity management of central bank money.
We also launched the preparation phase of the digital euro project. This phase started in November after a fruitful two-year investigation phase, and will lay the foundations for the potential issuance of a digital euro. A digital euro would complement cash, not replace it. Cash remains the most frequently used means of payment among euro area citizens, and a clear majority consider it important to have the ability to pay in cash.
This is in part why the ECB is preparing a new series of euro banknotes – the most tangible, visible symbol of European unity. The Governing Council selected “European culture” and “Rivers and birds” as two potential themes for this new series, based on the outcome of two public surveys carried out in the summer of 2023. Looking ahead, European citizens will have the chance to express their preferences on a shortlist of possible designs, with the ECB expected to decide on the final designs in 2026.
In a year that marked the 25th anniversary of the ECB, we celebrated the arrival of Croatia in the euro area. Croatia’s adoption of the euro in January brought the number of countries in the euro area to 20 – almost double the number when the single currency was first launched. The euro area’s expansion reflects the continued attractiveness of our monetary union in an increasingly unpredictable world. In 2023 people’s support for the euro remained close to record high levels.
All this could not have been done without the hard work and the dedication of ECB staff to our mission: maintaining price stability for the people of the euro area. It is an honour to lead them and this institution.
Frankfurt am Main, April 2024

The global economy fared better in 2023 than initially expected, continuing to expand at a moderate pace. The expansion was driven mainly by economic growth in emerging market economies and the United States, while most other advanced economies were more strongly affected by tight financing conditions and considerable geopolitical uncertainty. Global inflation declined markedly as energy commodity prices fell, while underlying price pressures remained elevated. The euro strengthened in nominal effective terms and against the US dollar.
In the euro area economic growth weakened in 2023. The industrial sector was particularly affected by tighter financing conditions, high input costs and weak global demand, whereas the services sector was initially still supported by lingering effects from the post-pandemic reopening of the economy. While the ECB’s interest rate tightening was transmitted forcefully to economic activity, the labour market remained fairly resilient. Euro area governments continued to wind down support measures adopted in response to the pandemic, energy price and inflation shocks, reversing part of the previous fiscal loosening. Headline inflation declined sharply in the euro area, helped particularly by energy inflation dropping into negative territory as the strong energy price surges of 2022 unwound. Underlying inflation also started to moderate, underpinning a general disinflationary process and reflecting the fading impact of past shocks and the increasing effects of tighter monetary policy.However, domestic price pressures replaced external pressures as the most important inflation drivers, as the labour market supported strong nominal wage developments, with workers seeking compensation for past inflation-induced losses in purchasing power.
1.1 Global economic activity expanded at a moderate pace as headline inflation declined
The global economy continued to expand at a moderate pace in 2023, with growth remaining broadly unchanged from 2022 at 3.5% (Chart 1.1).[1]Although subdued in a historical comparison, growth was higher than expected at the start of the year, supported by strong labour markets and buoyant demand for services despite continued monetary policy tightening.[2]The global economy was driven mainly by activity in emerging market economies and the United States, while in most other advanced economies tight financing conditions and the prolonged effects of geopolitical factors on energy prices weighed more materially on demand. In the United States, the economy was more resilient than expected, on the back of robust domestic demand and a strong labour market. Turmoil in the US financial sector at the beginning of the year did not have a significant macroeconomic impact. In China, an economic rebound at the beginning of the year, following the relaxation of highly restrictive pandemic-related measures in December 2022, was ended by a renewed slump in the housing sector as well as weak domestic and external demand. The Chinese economy nonetheless achieved the government’s stated growth target of around 5%.
Global trade was weak in 2023, as import growth slowed to 1.2%, well below the previous year’s growth rate of 5.5% and the pre-pandemic average of 3.1%.[3]The slowdown reflected three major trends. First, global demand moved back from goods towards services as pandemic-related restrictions were fully phased out. Second, the share of consumption, which is generally less trade-intensive than investment, in domestic demand increased. Finally, emerging market economies, where trade responds less to changes in economic activity, made a larger contribution to global activity in 2023. Despite increasing trade barriers and business survey results suggesting possible value chain relocation, evidence of fragmentation in aggregate trade flows has so far remained limited.
Annual headline consumer price index (CPI) inflationacross OECD member countries excluding Türkiye declined from high levels during 2023, brought down by lower energy prices. It fell to 3.9% in December, and for the whole of 2023 stood at 5.3%, compared with 7.3% in 2022 (Chart 1.2, panel a). Inflation excluding energy and food also declined, but to a much lesser extent, indicating that underlying price pressures remained strong and broad-based. This was particularly evident in advanced economies, where tight labour markets contributed to high wage growth rates, making services price inflation more persistent (Chart 1.2, panel b).
Energy commodity prices declined throughout 2023 as a result of lower demand. Oil prices fell by 4%, as weak demand for oil from advanced economies outweighed the increase in demand that followed the relaxation of lockdown measures in China. Low oil demand also more than offset the effects of supply cuts by the OPEC+ group as well as the risks to supply from geopolitical factors including the sanctions on Russia and the conflict in the Middle East. The fall in European gas prices was substantially larger, as gas prices continued the decline that started towards the end of 2022 and were reduced by another 58% in the course of 2023. European gas consumption remained below historical norms as a result of lower industrial demand, reduced gas consumption among households and mild weather in the winter months. The stable supply of liquified natural gas (LNG) also allowed European countries to start the heating season with full gas storage. Despite greater stability in the European gas market compared with the previous year, supply risks, such as strikes at Australian LNG terminals, continued to cause periods of high price volatility, illustrating the sensitivity of the European gas market during the transition away from Russian gas imports.
The euro strengthened in nominal effective terms (+3.9%) and against the US dollar (+3.4%) on the basis of year-end data, amid notable intra-year fluctuations. The exchange rate dynamics were primarily influenced by evolving market expectations resulting from shifts in monetary policies and volatile economic outlooks. Initially bolstered in the first half of the year by improved macroeconomic conditions in the euro area and a faster pace of monetary policy tightening, the euro started to depreciate against the US dollar in mid-July. The strengthening of the dollar, which was broad-based, was attributed to positive economic data surprises and market expectations of a tighter-for-longer monetary policy stance in the United States. A reassessment of the stance towards the end of the year amid declining inflation rates resulted in a renewed appreciation of the euro. Across major trading partners' currencies, the euro strengthened significantly against the Turkish lira, the Russian rouble, the Japanese yen and the Norwegian krone. However, it weakened against the pound sterling, the Swiss franc and the Polish zloty.
The major risks to the outlook for global economic growth at the end of 2023 included a further escalation of geopolitical tensions, a stronger slowdown in the Chinese economy and more persistent inflationary pressures that would require tighter monetary policy than anticipated. The materialisation of such risks would reduce global economic activity. Moreover, global commodity markets remained very sensitive to supply risks, which in turn could fuel inflation and weigh on global growth in the year ahead.
1.2Economic activity stagnates in the euro area
Euro area real GDP rose by 0.4% in 2023, having grown by 3.4% in 2022 (Chart 1.3). Growth reflected positive contributions from domestic demand and net trade. Changes in inventories had a dampening impact. By the end of the year output in the euro area was 3.0% above its pre-pandemic level (in the final quarter of 2019) and 1.4% above its level in the first quarter of 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. The slowdown in growth in 2023 was largely attributable to the economic repercussions of the war, which had varying effects across countries, reflecting their different economic structures. While the industrial sector was particularly affected by tighter monetary policy, high energy prices and weakening global demand, the services sector held up relatively well, still benefiting from post-pandemic reopening effects. However, towards the end of the year the weakness in growth dynamics broadened as the impact of higher interest rates spread across the various sectors, alongside spillover effects from the weak industrial sector to services.
Private consumption growth weakened considerably in 2023. It stagnated in the first half of the year as the continued drop in spending on goods, as captured by retail trade volumes (Chart 1.4), offset the still positive demand for services. In the third quarter private consumption increased, driven by households’ consumption of services, which was boosted by lingering reopening effects, and the rebound in spending on durable goods. Overall spending on goods (including semi-durable and non-durable goods) continued to contract amid tighter financing conditions. Overall, household spending increased by 0.5% in 2023. Real disposable income supported household spending to some extent in 2023 as nominal wage growth increased, inflation slowed down gradually and employment growth remained resilient. Nevertheless, the transmission of tighter financing conditions to the real economy seems to have weighed on household spending, as savings remained elevated.
Non-construction investment growth (a proxy for private non-housing investment) slowed throughout 2023.[4]While the first quarter of the year saw robust growth on the back of easing supply bottlenecks, the quarterly rates of increase gradually declined and investment fell in the fourth quarter, as both domestic and foreign demand weakened, backlogs dissolved, corporate profits slowed and financing conditions tightened. Uncertainty stemming from Russia’s war against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East among other factors likely also reduced investment incentives for firms.Nevertheless, abundant profits, ample cash reserves and a decline in indebtedness have on average strengthened corporate balance sheets over past years and contributed – along with funds from the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme supporting digitalisation and climate-related investment – to some resilience of investment compared with other expenditure components. Overall, non-construction investment grew by 2.9% in 2023.
Construction investment broadly continued to weaken over the course of 2023. The main reason for this was the decline in residential construction investment due to high construction costs, the continued rise in mortgage interest rates and the tightening of bank lending standards, which made it more difficult for households to access finance and dampened demand for residential property. Other areas of construction, such as civil engineering, remained more resilient, supported by public infrastructure investments. At the end of 2023 construction investment was 2.1% above its pre-pandemic level, having fallen by 0.6% overall in 2023.
The euro area goods trade balance returned to surplus in 2023 amid lower prices for imported energy. Export growth remained subdued in a context of weak foreign demand. Manufacturing exports were supported by the easing of supply bottlenecks, while lingering effects from the energy supply shock and the appreciation of the euro in effective terms contributed to export weakness. The subdued export performance extended to services exports in the second half of the year, as support from pent-up demand after the reopening of the global economy was fading. As domestic demand cooled, euro area imports also declined, driven by decreasing intermediate goods imports as firms destocked and energy imports fell.Overall, the contribution from trade to euro area GDP growth was slightly positive in 2023.
The euro area labour market remained resilient overall in 2023, although labour market developments and survey indicators at the end of the year pointed towards a cooling down. The unemployment rate averaged 6.5% in 2023; it declined from 6.6% in January to 6.5% in March and remained broadly stable at that level for the rest of the year (Chart 1.5). Total employment and total hours worked held up well amid a stagnating economy, rising in 2023 by 1.4% and 1.6% respectively. Average hours worked increased by only 0.2% in 2023, and in the last quarter of 2023 stood 1.3% below the pre-pandemic level, likely driven by factors such as labour hoarding (i.e. companies holding on to more workers than necessary in downturns) and an increase in sick leave. The labour force participation rate in the age group 15-74 years increased to a level of 65.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023, 1.1 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. In the second half of the year, labour demand showed some signs of softening, with the job vacancy rate still high but gradually receding from the peak reached in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, while the ECB’s interest rate increases continued to be transmitted forcefully to the economy, total employment and the euro area labour market, which is among the European Union’s objectives to which the ECB can contribute, if this is without prejudice to maintaining price stability, remained relatively resilient.
1.3 Fiscal policy measures in a challenging macroeconomic environment
The euro area general government deficit ratio continued to decrease in 2023, following a path started at the height of the pandemic (Chart 1.6).[5]The gradual tightening of fiscal policy is also reflected in the fiscal stance, which tightened moderately in 2023 for the third year in a row.[6]However, only slightly over a third of the loosening in 2020 has so far been reversed (Chart 1.6). This means that the cyclically adjusted budget balance remains well below its pre-pandemic level, owing to lasting measures adopted in the context of the pandemic in 2020 and the energy-related support provided from 2022 onwards.
Seen from the end-2023 perspective, a challenge for fiscal authorities will be how best to reverse this cumulative expansion of the last four years (Chart 1.7) and to reduce debt ratios, particularly given that demographic developments, the green and digital transitions as well as the geopolitical environment will require fiscal room for manoeuvre in the future. The 2024 government budgets pointed towards a continuation of the fiscal tightening cycle at the euro area level. This largely reflected an unwinding of discretionary fiscal measures that had been adopted in response to the energy and inflation shocks. Such measures were estimated to have amounted to over 1% of GDP in 2023, yet only a small part of this was expected to remain in place in 2024. Notably, however, some of the expansionary measures adopted by governments during the pandemic seemed to be of a more long-lasting nature and, on the basis of the 2024 budgets, were not set to expire in the short run. This was the case for increased transfers and subsidies but to some extent also tax reductions.
A further tightening of the fiscal stance also appears appropriate from the viewpoint of monetary policy. As the energy crisis has now largely faded, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures, which is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures. This would otherwise call for tighter monetary policy. Besides rolling back the pandemic and energy-related measures, governments should more generally make progress towards sounder fiscal positions to ensure that public finances are on a sustainable path.
A robust EU framework for economic and fiscal policy coordination and surveillance remains crucial. After extensive discussions, the Council of the European Union agreed in 2023 on a reform of the EU’s economic governance framework, which opened the way for a trilogue between the European Commission, the EU Council and the European Parliament. 2024 will be an important year to transit towards its implementation.[7]
1.4 Headline inflation saw a steep decline throughout the year
Headline inflation in the euro area as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 2.9% in December 2023, a decline of 6.3 percentage points from its level in December 2022. It fell steadily throughout the year, with the disinflationary process also showing up in underlying inflation as the year progressed. In November headline inflation reached a temporary trough of 2.4%, the lowest level in more than two years (sharply down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022) (Chart 1.8). However, inflation moved slightly higher again in December, owing to the downward effects of energy-related fiscal measures on price levels a year earlier. All major components of inflation saw declines in year-on-year inflation rates over the second half of 2023, reflecting the fading impact of previous cost shocks and weaker demand amid tighter monetary policy. However, year-on-year inflation rates (other than for energy prices) were at year-end still significantly above their longer-term averages, while annualised quarter-on-quarter rates had already moved much closer to such benchmarks. Price dynamics for goods decelerated more swiftly than those for services, as easing supply bottlenecks and input costs took considerable pressure off. Services price inflation rose until mid-year, owing to still strong post-pandemic demand, increasing labour costs, and temporary factors related to fiscal measures. With the reduction in energy and food inflation, the disparities in inflation rates across euro area countries also diminished substantially.
Developments in energy prices accounted for more than half of the drop in headline inflation between December 2022 and December 2023.Energy inflation was still high in January 2023, but by year-end had declined by 25.6 percentage points into negative territory. This reflected the unwinding of the strong surges in wholesale energy prices that had taken place in 2022. However, energy inflation remained somewhat volatile, as wholesale energy markets were sensitive to events such as the conflict in the Middle East. Meanwhile, food inflation peaked at 15.5% in March 2023. It then declined substantially throughout the rest of the year, although was still over 6% towards year-end owing to the persistent impact of earlier cost shocks stemming from energy and other inputs, and to higher pressures from unit profits and labour costs.
Core inflation – as measured by HICP inflation excluding the volatile components energy and food – continued to increase into the first quarter of the year, but then moderated from a peak of 5.7% to stand at 3.4% in December. This decline was initially driven by non-energy industrial goods inflation, as demand for goods weakened amid tighter financing conditions (see Section 1.2) and accumulated pressures from past supply bottlenecks and high energy costs started to dissipate. Meanwhile, services inflation hovered at high levels until August as a result of still strong demand after the reopening of the economy (for contact-intensive services sectors such as recreation and holidays) as well as rising labour costs, especially given the larger labour share in the cost structure of the services sector compared with manufacturing. Towards the end of the year, however, services inflation also fell somewhat and confirmed the general disinflationary process. Moreover the lagged dynamics in services inflation reflected the fact that many services components typically lag headline inflation (e.g. housing, postal and medical services). All other indicators of underlying inflation also moderated significantly during the year, reflecting the fading impact of past shocks and the increasing impact of tighter monetary policy, yet they continued to span a wide range and most indicators still clearly exceeded pre-pandemic levels.[8]
Growth in the GDP deflator (a reliable measure of domestic price pressures) was on average 6.0% in 2023. This compared with average import price inflation of -2.9%, reflecting the shift from external to domestic drivers of inflation. While profits had still played a prominent role in domestic price pressures at the turn of the year 2022/ 2023 (see Box 2), labour costs gradually became the dominant factor, given strong wage developments and a reduction in labour productivity (Chart 1.9).Annual growth in compensation per employee increased to 5.1% on average in 2023 from 4.5% in 2022, rates substantially above the pre-pandemic (2015-19) average of 1.7%, which was facilitated by still tight labour markets (see Section 1.2). The further strengthening reflected in part workers seeking compensation for past inflation-induced losses in the purchasing power of nominal wages. Growth in negotiated wages rose to 4.5% on average in 2023; the difference compared with actual wage growth implies a still sizeable wage drift component, though lower than in 2021-22.[9]Growth in both compensation per employee and negotiated wages started to edge down towards the end of the year, but their growth levels remained elevated and signalled still high nominal wage pressures going into 2024. This reflected a recovery of real wages rather than evidence of destabilising wage-price dynamics.
Average longer-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters, which had stood at 2.2% in late 2022, edged down to 2.1% in 2023. Other survey data, such as from the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts and Consensus Economics, also suggested that longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored around the ECB’s 2% target. A market-based measure of longer-term inflation compensation (the five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead) rose to a peak of 2.7% in August, but decreased to 2.3% in late December amid news of lower than anticipated headline inflation and a subdued economic growth outlook (see Section 1.2). In any case market-based measures corrected for risk premia implied “genuine” expectations very close to 2%. On the consumer side, median inflation expectations for three years ahead remained slightly above this at 2.5% in December, possibly reflecting high uncertainty, negative economic sentiment and still high price levels relative to wages.[10]
1.5 Credit and financing conditions tightened strongly as policy rates increased
With inflationary pressures remaining elevated and persistent throughout 2023 (see Section 1.4), the ECB continued to tighten monetary policy decisively until September, and subsequently maintained the key ECB interest rates at restrictive levels,to ensure that inflation returns to the 2% target over the medium term (see Section 2.1). The – risk-free – ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate hovered around 3% through most of the year, reaching a peak of 3.3% in October before declining to an average 2.5% in December (Chart 1.10). The decline in the ten-year OIS rate towards the end of the year was due to a sharp drop in financial market interest rate expectations, mostly after inflation came in lower than expected. The drop in expectations was only partially compensated by an increase in the term premium. Long-term government bond yields followed developments in the OIS rate very closely. Their spreads were not significantly affected by the process of normalising the Eurosystem balance sheet (see Section 2.1) and at year-end were virtually the same as in December 2022. The euro area GDP-weighted average of ten-year nominal government bond yields averaged 2.7% in December 2023, 10 basis points below its level a year earlier.
Stock prices increased in 2023, in both the non-financial sector and, particularly, the banking sector. A decline in equity risk premia supported equity prices amid low and falling volatility despite heightened geopolitical tensions. The index of euro area bank stocks was boosted further by expectations of an increase in bank earnings in both the long and short term, with the March banking sector market turbulence in the United States and Switzerland having a sizeable but temporary negative impact. The broad indices of euro area non-financial corporation and bank equity prices ended 2023 around 12% and 23% above their respective end-2022 levels. Corporate bond yields declined and stood, on average, at lower levels in December 2023 than in December 2022 in both the investment grade and high-yield segments, owing to lower risk-free rates combined with a compression of corporate bond spreads.
Broad money (M3) stagnated, mainly reflecting the tightening of monetary policy. Its annual rate of change was only 0.1% in December, having declined significantly during 2023and even temporarily reaching negative rates for the first time since the inception of Monetary Union(Chart 1.11). The decline was driven by subdued credit creation, high opportunity costs of holding liquid assets and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet. While bank balance sheets remained robust overall, repayments of funds borrowed under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations and a contraction in the Eurosystem asset portfolios reduced excess liquidity. Bank funding costs increased steeply, although by less than policy rates, as banks turned to more expensive market funding sources and competed more actively for customer deposits by offering higher interest on them.
The transmission of the monetary policy tightening to broader financing conditions remained strong in 2023. As indicated by theeuro area bank lending survey, banks tightened their credit standards (i.e. internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans to households and firms substantially further. This was confirmed by thesurvey on the access to finance of enterprisesfor firms and theConsumer Expectations Surveyfor households. Nominal bank lending rates increased steeply again in 2023, reaching their highest levels in almost 15 years. The composite bank lending rate for loans to households for house purchase stood at 4.0% at the end of the year, up by about 100 basis points compared with the end of 2022, and the equivalent rate for non-financial corporations increased by 180 basis points to 5.2%, a rise of almost twice the increase seen for households (Chart 1.10). The increases in lending rates were more rapid and larger than in previous episodes of monetary policy tightening, mostly reflecting the faster and larger policy rate hikes since July 2022. The disparity in lending rates across countries remained contained, indicating that changes in the ECB’s monetary policy were being transmitted to lending rates smoothly across the euro area.
Bank lending to households and firms weakened markedly in 2023, on the back of tighter credit conditions (Chart 1.11). Net monthly flows of loans were almost zero in the last three quarters of the year.The annual growth rate of bank loans to households declined, standing at 0.3% in December, mostly reflecting the slowdown in mortgages amid falling house prices for the first year since 2014. The annual growth rate of bank loans to firms also fell, reaching 0.4% in December, and the net flows of overall external financing to firms were at historical lows (Chart 1.12).
In 2023 the ECB stayed the course in raising key policy interest rates to, and keeping them at, levels sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. In the first nine months of the year it increased rates by 200 basis points, bringing the deposit facility rate to 4%, as exceptionally high inflationary pressure stemming from high energy costs spread through the economy. High food prices were also a significant contributing factor. In addition, the effects of supply bottlenecks and of pent-up demand linked to the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions were, although easing, still driving up prices, and wage growth picked up. The ECB’s decisions reflected a data-dependent approach and were based on the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In the course of the year the available information increasingly showed that the tightening of monetary policy was being forcefully transmitted to the economy. In addition, incoming inflation data indicated that the disinflation process, as signalled especially by the decline in measures of underlying inflation, continued to make progress. Ultimately the Governing Council decided at its October and December meetings to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged.
The Eurosystem balance sheet continued to contract as part of the monetary policy normalisation that began in 2022, notwithstanding the additional €45 billion contribution from Hrvatska narodna banka’s balance sheet following the adoption of the euro by Croatia on 1 January 2023. The Eurosystem balance sheet reached €6.9 trillion by year-end, a decline of more than €1 trillion in one year and of almost €2 trillion when compared with its peak in mid-2022. The reduction was mainly the result of the maturing and early repayments of long-term funds borrowed by banks under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and was supported by the end of both the full and the partial reinvestment phase in the asset purchase programme (APP), in the periods starting in March and July respectively. In December 2023 the Governing Council decided to advance the normalisation of the Eurosystem balance sheet, expressing its intention to gradually phase out reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) starting in July 2024. In 2023, following the announcement of December 2022, the Eurosystem worked on the review of its operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which was concluded in March 2024.
Moreover, the ECB proceeded in 2023 with the gradual removal, initiated in 2022, of its pandemic-related collateral easing measures, and the Hellenic Republic’s credit rating was upgraded to investment grade level. Throughout 2023 the Eurosystem emphasised risk management to ensure efficient policy implementation, including by diversifying the credit assessment sources it accepts. With the key interest rates having been raised to bring down inflation, the ECB incurred losses from negative interest income, which were partly offset by previously established financial buffers. The monetary income of the ECB is expected to increase again in the future, which will support its operational effectiveness.
2.1 Pursuing a restrictive monetary policy to bring inflation back to the 2% target
In early 2023 economic growth stagnated in the euro area, after a marked deceleration since mid-2022. However, the economy showed signs of resilience in the face of significant challenges from subdued global economic activity, geopolitical uncertainties owing to Russia’s war against Ukraine and high inflation along with tighter financing conditions. Headline inflation declined in January as a result of lower energy prices but remained high at 8.6%, also in light of high food prices. This was partly due to the pervasive impact of high energy costs across the economy, which also influenced food prices, alongside ongoing – although fading – pandemic-related factors such as supply chain disruptions and pent-up demand. Wage growth was also picking up.
In light of the medium-term inflation outlook, the Governing Council reaffirmed its intention to pursue a restrictive monetary policy and raised the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points at its February meeting. It also said that it intended to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at its meeting in March, and would then evaluate the subsequent monetary policy path. The Governing Council remained steadfast in raising interest rates at a steady pace to levels sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to its 2% medium-term target. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels should gradually reduce inflation by dampening demand and pre-empting any sustained upward shift in inflation expectations.
At its February meeting, the Governing Council also established modalities for reducing Eurosystem securities holdings under the APP. This followed on from its December 2022 decision to no longer reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities in full from March onwards, so that the APP portfolio would decrease by a monthly average of €15 billion from March to June 2023, with the subsequent reduction pace to be determined later. Corporate bond reinvestments would be tilted more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance. While maintaining a focus on the ECB’s price stability objective, this strategy was aimed at taking better account of climate-related financial risk in the Eurosystem balance sheet and gradually decarbonising corporate bond holdings in alignment with the ECB’s secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the EU, which include efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change (see Box 8).
In March, amid the banking sector turbulence in the United States and Switzerland, financial market tensions soared and increased uncertainty about the outlook for euro area growth and inflation. In addition, the March ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresaw sustained high inflation levels, particularly in inflation excluding energy and food, although inflation was expected to decrease in the coming years. With inflation projected to remain too high for too long, the Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Moreover, the heightened uncertainty emphasised the importance of a data-dependent approach to the Governing Council’s policy rate decisions. It therefore also clarified its “reaction function”, explaining that its policy rate decisions would be guided by three criteria: the inflation outlook in light of incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council also continued to monitor market tensions closely, standing ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and contribute to financial stability in the euro area. In the following months, the euro area banking sector proved resilient to the tensions emanating from outside the euro area.
As the year advanced, it was increasingly evident that the Governing Council’s restrictive interest rate policy was having a significant impact on the economy.Past rate increases were being transmitted forcefully to euro area monetary and financing conditions – the initial stages of the transmission mechanism – and were gradually having effects across the economy, even though the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remained uncertain. In April borrowing rates for businesses and mortgages reached their highest levels in over a decade. The resultant decline in credit demand, along with tighter credit standards, led to a progressive slowdown in loan growth. Banks also repaid the largest amount of funds borrowed under TLTRO III in June, causing a significant decline in excess liquidity. This reduction did not hinder the smooth transmission of monetary policy rate changes to risk-free rates in money markets, although an asymmetry emerged in the reaction of the spread between the euro short-term rate (€STR) and the ECB’s deposit facility rate. The spread did not narrow with the liquidity reduction, in contrast to its widening when liquidity had increased (see Box 3).
Headline inflation declined markedly. It dropped to 6.1% in May from 8.5% in February, with 6.9% in March and 7.0% in April. Nevertheless, while inflation was expected to decline further toward the target, largely driven by the concurrent tightening of financing conditions that was increasingly dampening demand, price pressures were still anticipated to remain too strong for too long. The Governing Council therefore opted for another two consecutive 25 basis point interest rate increases, in May and June respectively.
After the pace of reinvestment was reduced in March, July marked the end of APP reinvestments. Reinvestments under PEPP were still set to continue until at least the end of 2024. At the same time, developments since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting supported its expectation that inflation would drop further over the remainder of the year but stay above target for an extended period. On this basis, the Governing Council stayed on course to raise interest rates by an additional 25 basis points in July.
The Governing Council also decided in July to reduce the remuneration of minimum reserves from the deposit facility rate to 0%. This decision was aimed at maintaining the effectiveness of monetary policy by retaining control over the monetary policy stance while ensuring a full pass-through of interest rate decisions to money markets. It also enhanced policy efficiency by reducing overall interest expenses stemming from reserves while achieving the same degree of monetary restriction.
With inflation in August showing almost no progress from the 5.3% recorded in July, and the inflation outlook in the September ECB staff projections revised upwards for 2023 and 2024, mainly owing to a higher path for energy prices, the Governing Council increased the key ECB rates by another 25 basis points at its September meeting. This brought the cumulative increase over 2023 to 200 basis points and the deposit facility rate to 4% (Chart 2.1).
However, the economy was expected to remain subdued in the following months, after having stagnated over the first half of the year. The increasing impact of the Governing Council’s tightening measures on domestic demand, coupled with a challenging international trade environment, led ECB staff to significantly lower their economic growth projections in September 2023. Additionally, while underlying price pressures persisted at high levels, most indicators started to ease, and the projected path for inflation excluding energy and food was also revised slightly downwards. On the basis of this updated assessment, the Governing Council also considered that the key ECB interest rates had reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, would make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to its target.
After ten consecutive rate hikes, the Governing Council decided at its October meeting to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. From the start of the rate increases in July 2022, the ECB had raised the deposit facility rate from -0.50% to 4% by September 2023. While inflation was still anticipated to remain persistently high owing to robust domestic price pressures, it continued to decrease significantly in September, dropping to 4.3%. This decline was accompanied by an easing in measures of underlying inflation. The increased geopolitical risks arising from October onwards from the conflict in the Middle East also further underscored the importance of the Governing Council's data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction in its key policy rates.
As the year came to a close, inflation continued to decrease, reaching 2.4% in November. At its December meeting, however, the Governing Council assessed that it was likely to temporarily rise again in the near term, owing to base effects. Underlying inflation had eased further. The Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections suggested that inflation would resume its gradual decline in 2024. At the same time domestic price pressures were seen as remaining elevated, primarily owing to strong growth in unit labour costs.
Against this background, the Governing Council decided at its December meeting to keep its key rates unchanged.
The Governing Council also decided in December to advance the normalisation of the Eurosystem balance sheet. It expressed the intention to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing PEPP securities until mid-2024, before reducing the portfolio by an average €7.5 billion per month until year-end and discontinuing reinvestments thereafter.
2.2Eurosystem balance sheet developments as monetary policy tightens further
In 2023 the Eurosystem balance sheet continued the gradual reduction started in 2022 with the normalisation of monetary policy. It declined further as the full and partial reinvestment phases of the APP ended in February and June respectively. Under the PEPP, the Eurosystem continued full reinvestments throughout the year. By the end of 2023 the balance sheet had declined to €6.9 trillion, mainly on account of TLTRO III operations maturing as well as early repayments, and to some extent also as the APP portfolio began to be wound down.
At the end of 2023 monetary policy-related assets on the Eurosystem balance sheet amounted to €5.1 trillion, a decline of €1.2 trillion compared with the end of 2022. Loans to euro area credit institutions accounted for 6% of total assets (down from 17% at the end of 2022) and assets purchased for monetary policy purposes represented 68% of total assets (up from 62% at the end of 2022). Other financial assets on the balance sheet consisted mainly of foreign currency-denominated assets, gold and euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios.
On the liabilities side, the overall amount of credit institutions’ reserve holdings and recourse to the deposit facility decreased to €3.5 trillion at the end of 2023 (from €4.0 trillion at the end of 2022) and represented 51% of total liabilities (compared with 50% at the end of 2022). Banknotes in circulation were virtually unchanged at €1.6 trillion and accounted for 23% of total liabilities (up from 20%).
In 2023, following the announcement of December 2022, the Eurosystem worked on the review of its operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which was concluded in March 2024.
The adoption of the euro by Croatia on 1 January 2023 and the inclusion of Hrvatska narodna banka’s balance sheet in the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem increased the latter’s total assets and liabilities by €45 billion.
The APP comprises four asset purchase programmes: the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). The PEPP was introduced in 2020 in response to the pandemic. All asset categories eligible under the APP are also eligible under the PEPP; a waiver of the eligibility requirements was temporarily granted for the PEPP for securities issued by the Hellenic Republic.[25]
In December 2021 the Governing Council confirmed its intention to gradually start the normalisation of its monetary policy, by reducing the pace at which it purchased securities for the PEPP and, subsequently, the APP. It announced the end of net asset purchases under the PEPP, and in March 2022 gave an expected end date for the net purchases under the APP. The Eurosystem ended net purchases under the PEPP as of 1 April 2022 and continued to reinvest (in full) the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme. It ended net purchases under the APP as of 1 July 2022 and began to only reinvest (in full) the principal payments from maturing securities. It then decided to reduce the Eurosystem holdings under the APP at a measured and predictable pace through partial reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities between March and June 2023, thereby ensuring that the Eurosystem maintained a continuous market presence under the APP over this period. Finally, the Governing Council confirmed on 15 June 2023 that it would discontinue reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023. For the PEPP, full reinvestments were continued till the end of 2022 and throughout 2023. On 14 December 2023 the Governing Council announced its intention to continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP during the first half of 2024 and reduce the PEPP portfolio by €7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of 2024, before discontinuing reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of that year. Reinvestment purchases continued to be conducted in a smooth manner and in line with the respective prevailing market conditions.
The size of the APP portfolio remained stable during the full reinvestment phase from July 2022 to February 2023. During the partial reinvestment phase, from March to June 2023, it declined by €60 billion, at an average pace of €15 billion per month, before the full run-off started in July 2023. Overall, APP holdings declined from €3.254 trillion (at amortised cost) at the end of 2022 to €3.026 trillion at the end of 2023. The PSPP accounted for the bulk of these holdings, with €2.403 trillion or 79% of total APP holdings at the end of the year. Under the PSPP, redemptions were in general reinvested in the jurisdiction in which principal repayments fell due. In addition, some national central banks purchased securities issued by EU supranational institutions. The weighted average maturity of the PSPP holdings stood at 7.0 years at the end of 2023, with some variation across jurisdictions. The ABSPP accounted for less than 1% (€13 billion) of total APP holdings at year-end, the CBPP3 for 9% (€286 billion) and the CSPP for 11% (€324 billion). Corporate and covered bond purchases were guided by benchmarks reflecting the market capitalisation of all eligible outstanding corporate and covered bonds respectively. The Eurosystem continued to tilt its corporate securities purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance and published its first climate-related financial disclosures for the corporate securities holdings under the CSPP and PEPP, as well as for its non-monetary policy portfolios – see Section 11.5. Securities purchases under the APP were implemented smoothly throughout the first half of 2023. The partial reinvestment phase and the discontinuation of the purchases were well absorbed by the financial markets and did not cause any major disturbance.
At the end of 2023 PEPP holdings amounted to €1.7 trillion (at amortised cost). Covered bond holdings accounted for less than 1% (€6 billion) of the total, corporate sector holdings for 3% (€46 billion) and public sector holdings for 97% (€1,614 billion).[26]The weighted average maturity of the PEPP public sector securities holdings stood at 7.3 years at the end of 2023, with some differences across jurisdictions.
Redemptions of private sector securities under the APP and PEPP amounted to €80 billion in 2023, while redemptions of public sector securities under the PSPP and PEPP amounted to €438 billion. Reinvestments under the APP and PEPP amounted to €36 billion for private sector securities and €271 billion for public sector securities. Given the large and unevenly distributed redemptions, the public sector reinvestments were smoothed across jurisdictions and across time to ensure a regular and balanced market presence, giving due regard to market price formation and market functioning considerations. This smoothing mechanism led to additional temporary deviations of the PEPP holdings from the allocation in accordance with the Eurosystem capital key, but these were largely reversed by the end of the smoothing period, which is the calendar year in which the redemptions take place.
The assets purchased under the PSPP, CSPP, CBPP3 and PEPP continued to be made available for securities lending to support bond and repo market liquidity. In 2023 repo market conditions improved significantly compared with the previous year, which was reflected in smaller lending volumes.
At the end of 2023 the outstanding amount of Eurosystem refinancing operations was €410 billion, representing a decline of €914 billion compared with the end of 2022. This change mainly reflects voluntary early repayments (€312.5 billion) and the maturing of operations (€612.9 billion) under the TLTRO III series. The weighted average maturity of outstanding Eurosystem refinancing operations decreased from around 10.5 months at the end of 2022 to 5.2 months at the end of 2023.
In March 2022 the ECB announced the gradual phasing-out of pandemic-related collateral easing measures. These measures were a core element of the ECB’s monetary policy response to the pandemic, making it easier for counterparties to access Eurosystem credit operations by increasing the volume of eligible collateral. The central focus of the measures was a temporary reduction in valuation haircuts across all asset classes by a fixed factor of 20% and temporary extensions to the additional credit claim (ACC) frameworks implemented by some national central banks.
The gradual phase-out started in July 2022. In a second step, which took effect from 29 June 2023,the temporary reduction in valuation haircuts for marketable and non-marketable assets was fully phased out by implementing a new haircut schedule, thus marking the return to the ECB’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance level for credit operations.[27]
A third step in the phasing-out of the pandemic collateral easing measures will be a comprehensive review of the ACC framework. Some national central banks terminated their national ACC frameworks in full or in part in the course of 2023 or before.[28]In November 2023, the ECB announced the discontinuation of the eligibility of short-term debt instruments for use as collateral under theGuideline on temporary collateral measures[29], as well as of some specific features of the ACC frameworks. In addition, it decided to reinstate the €25,000 minimum size for domestic credit claims accepted as collateral for domestic use, as well as to extend the validity of the ACC frameworks with their remaining features, until at least the end of 2024. These decisions are to be implemented in the course of 2024.
In September 2023 the relevant credit rating of the Hellenic Republic was upgraded from credit quality step 4 to step 3 on the Eurosystem’s harmonised rating scale (from BB+ to BBB-), positioning all debt instruments issued by the central government of the Hellenic Republic at investment grade level.[30]The debt instruments issued by the central government of the Hellenic Republic, which previously benefited from a waiver included in the Guideline on temporary collateral measures, are therefore as of September 2023 subject to the eligibility criteria under the general collateral framework.
The nominal amount of eligible marketable assets increased by €1.2 trillion in 2023, reaching a level of €18.3 trillion at the end of the year (Chart 2.3). Central government securities continued to be the largest asset class (€9.9 trillion). Other asset classes included corporate bonds (€1.9 trillion), covered bank bonds (€1.8 trillion) and unsecured bank bonds (€2 trillion). Regional government securities (€603 billion), asset-backed securities (€600 billion) and other marketable assets (€1.4 trillion) each accounted for a comparatively small fraction of the eligible assets universe.
Between the adjustment of the interest rates applicable to TLTRO III in November 2022 and the end of 2023, counterparties repaid 80% of their outstanding credit, which was accompanied by a sizable reduction in mobilised collateral of more than €900 billion (Chart 2.4). Following the early repayments between November 2022 and January 2023, counterparties demobilised in particular government bonds, which have a relatively high opportunity cost and can be used in private repo funding. In addition, they demobilised more than €250 billion of covered bonds and asset-backed securities in the course of 2023. The maturity of the TLTRO III operation in June 2023 was also accompanied by a large reduction in mobilised collateral (around €300 billion), which corresponded to 60% of the net credit repaid on that day. However, two-thirds of that drop in mobilised collateral was due to the partial phasing-out of the pandemic collateral easing measures, in particular the phasing-out of certain pools of ACCs in France as well as the reversal of the remaining 10% haircut reduction.
2.3 Managing financial risks of monetary policy instruments
The Eurosystem continuously manages the financial risks inherent in the implementation of its monetary policy operations. Its risk management function endeavours to attain risk efficiency, i.e. to achieve monetary policy objectives with the lowest amount of risk.[31]
The ECB increased its key interest rates several times in 2023 to bring inflation back to the Governing Council’s medium-term target of 2%. This increased the cost of the liabilities on the balance sheets of Eurosystem central banks, while the income generated on their APP and PEPP securities portfolios and TLTRO III remained low. This resulted in negative interest income, which can be partly offset against financial buffers built up in previous years. If these buffers are fully utilised, any remaining losses are recorded on the balance sheets. However, such losses can be offset with future profits and do not affect the ability of Eurosystem central banks to operate effectively. Over time, the Eurosystem’s asset-liability mismatch is expected to decrease, which will improve its profit and loss accounts.[32]
The main changes to the Eurosystem’s risk management framework in 2023 were a further diversification of its credit assessment sources and a stronger tilting of purchases of corporate sector securities towards issuers with a better climate performance.
2023 was marked by the acceptance of additional credit assessment sources within theEurosystem Credit Assessment Framework(ECAF). The ECAF is a risk management framework employed by the Eurosystem to mitigate the credit risk of assets used in monetary policy operations. It defines the procedures, rules and techniques that ensure the Eurosystem requirement of high credit standards for all eligible assets is met on an ongoing basis. This involves the assessment, acceptance and monitoring of different types of credit assessment source.
In April 2023 the Governing Council decided to accept the Bank of Greece’s in-house credit assessment system, which provides assessments of Greek legal entities in the non-financial sector, as a credit assessment source. These assessments can now be used to determine the eligibility of credit claims on Greek non-financial corporations as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, and valuation haircuts for them. The Bank of Greece’s in-house assessment system is one of nine national central bank credit assessment systems currently accepted by the Governing Council.
In November theGoverning Council decided to accept Scope Ratings GmbH as an external credit assessment institution(ECAI), following a thorough Eurosystem assessment of the company’s application based on the Eurosystem’s acceptance criteria for ECAIs. The assessment encompassed quantitative and qualitative criteria, as well as any relevant supervisory feedback from the European Securities and Markets Authority. The ratings provided by Scope Ratings will be used together with the ratings of the already accepted ECAIs (DBRS Morningstar, Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings) to determine the eligibility of collateral assets for monetary policy operations, and the valuation haircuts to be applied, once the process of integrating Scope Ratings into the Eurosystem IT infrastructure has been concluded.
In 2023 reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities continued to be conducted for monetary policy purposes under the PEPP and, until the end of June, also under the APP. The financial risks of these programmes are managed on the basis of specific financial risk control frameworks that take into account each programme’s policy objectives and the features and risk profiles of the different asset types purchased. The frameworks consist of eligibility criteria, credit risk assessments and due diligence procedures, pricing frameworks, benchmarks and limits. They applied to net asset purchases and continue to apply to the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing holdings, as well as to the holdings for as long as they remain on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet. The key elements of these frameworks, as summarised inSection 2.3 of the ECB’s Annual Report 2022, Table 2.1, are still valid. For corporate sector securities, the Eurosystem applied a stronger tilting of its reinvestments of principal payments from maturing securities towards issuers with a better climate performance as of the start of partial reinvestment under the APP in March 2023.
Banks in the euro area proved to be resilient in 2023, particularly in the face of bank failures in the United States and Switzerland. They benefited from progress made on several fronts, along with continued supervisory engagement. The financial stability environment nonetheless remained fragile as tighter financial conditions challenged the real economy and the financial sector. National authorities continued to implement or tighten macroprudential buffers in order to enhance the strength of the banking sector. Moreover, the regulatory frameworks for banks, as well as for financial infrastructure and innovations, were further improved to increase the long-term resilience of the financial system.
3.1 The financial stability environment in 2023
The financial stability environment in the euro area remained fragile throughout 2023, reflecting a combination of challenges related to high inflation, tighter financial conditions, weaker growth prospects and fresh geopolitical tensions in the Middle East adding to the impact of Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. In March 2023 bank failures in the United States and Switzerland triggered a financial shock which was potent but ultimately short-lived, owing to resolute policy action that resulted in financial stability concerns quickly shifting towards other challenges, such as the implications of higher interest rates and downside risks to growth. Rising ECB policy rates continued to gradually drive up funding costs for all sectors of the economy. However, the lengthening of interest rate fixation periods for loans granted in previous years, alongside resilient labour markets and accumulated savings, muted the credit risk implications of higher borrowing costs for borrowers throughout the year. Overall, asset quality of euro area banks remained robust but bank loan losses started to rise, albeit from low levels, and non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) entities continued to face elevated credit risk associated with higher numbers of rating downgrades in their bond portfolios.
Euro area sovereigns, having locked in low interest rates in previous years and against the backdrop of the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument, saw a broad-based increase in funding costs in 2023, with limited dispersion across countries over the year. However, as governments are faced with having to roll over maturing debt at higher interest rates, their funding costs remain sensitive to the evolution of fiscal fundamentals, notably the risk of fiscal slippage, which could reignite sovereign debt sustainability concerns. At the same time, any unwarranted, disorderly sovereign debt market dynamics can be countered by flexibility in the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme reinvestments and by the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument, if the necessary conditions are fulfilled.
Similarly, prior to and during the pandemic, the corporate sector benefited from low interest rates and its earnings held up well in 2023. As the effects of the recovery faded, credit conditions tightened and debt servicing costs went up, corporate vulnerabilities increased. Although generally still low, there was a nascent rise in corporate failures during the year. Real estate firms were particularly vulnerable owing to the ongoing downturn in euro area commercial property market.
The household sector was faced with a deterioration in debt servicing capacity in 2023, owing to rising interest rates and the ongoing correction in residential property markets. The steep increase in borrowing costs from the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle clearly had a negative impact on mortgage demand. That notwithstanding, a strong labour market alongside housing supply constraints underpinned an orderly cooling in residential real estate markets. Nevertheless, still elevated valuations suggest that vulnerabilities could materialise if price corrections become disorderly.
Looking through several episodes of volatility in 2023, the overall pricing in financial markets during the year appeared to be predicated on optimistic expectations about the future macro-financial outlook and was therefore considered to be vulnerable to negative surprises. While risk premia in the corporate bond market seemed to be well aligned with historical patterns, they were significantly compressed in the equity market. The unusually modest reaction of stock prices to rising interest rates was seen as rendering equities vulnerable to abrupt repricing if the adverse effects of the economic slowdown on corporate profitability turned out to be greater than anticipated by investors. Furthermore, market risk sentiment remained highly sensitive to further surprises regarding the outlook for inflation, growth and, by extension, the path of monetary policy.
The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of euro area banks stood at 15.6% in the third quarter of 2023. This was close to its highest level since the start of European banking supervision and reflected the higher profitability and de-risking of bank portfolios. Strong capital and liquidity buffers helped to preserve trust in the euro area banking system during the tensions triggered by bank failures in the United States and Switzerland early in the year. In addition, euro area banks’ return on equity increased further to 10.0%, its highest level in more than a decade, driven by wider net interest margins as yields on assets rose faster than the cost of funding. While bank earnings benefited from these tailwinds, they were likely at risk from three headwinds: (i) the combination of higher inflation, rising debt servicing costs and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment potentially having an adverse impact on bank asset quality, which had already started to materialise with initial signs of rising default rates and payment arrears; (ii) tighter credit standards reducing demand for loans, and flows of new lending declining to their lowest levels since 2015; and (iii) funding costs appearing set to rise, as aggregate deposit rates began to inch up – notably for term deposits – and market funding costs started to become more expensive. Notwithstanding these challenges, the results of the 2023 EU-wide stress test conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) confirmed that banks could be expected to remain resilient to severely adverse shocks.
The NBFI sector remained relatively stable in 2023, with continued inflows into sovereign and investment-grade corporate bond funds. This helped to increase the absorption of debt issued by sovereigns and corporates. At the same time, NBFI entities actively reduced their overall credit risk exposure during the year through an ongoing de-risking process, rebalancing their investment portfolios towards comparatively safer assets. Nevertheless, they remained vulnerable to credit risk. Owing to the high level of economic uncertainty and tighter financial conditions, the NBFI sector was potentially at risk from revaluation losses as a result of rating downgrades in bond portfolios, as well as from defaults. It also continued to be exposed to liquidity risk, with cash buffers in equity and bond funds remaining low in the context of tightening financial conditions. Overall, as liquidity holdings across the segments of the NBFI sector remained subdued, there was the risk that sudden investment fund outflows, large margin calls or lapsing insurance policies would lead to forced asset sales. Real estate investment funds were still particularly exposed to revaluation losses and investor outflows, especially given the challenges in the commercial real estate sector. The instability in this segment was particularly concerning, owing to its importance for the real estate sector and its potential to amplify risks to that sector.
Euro area banks, funds and insurers continued to face challenges stemming from climate change in 2023. Cyber risk also required close monitoring. The increasing frequency of major natural disasters as a result of climate change, and the growing magnitude of associated losses also pushed up insurance prices amid only limited availability of insurance against climate-related hazards.[33]This underlined the risk of a greater incidence of climate shocks exacerbating profitability challenges faced by non-life insurers and widening prevailing protection gaps (the proportion of economic losses not covered by insurance), with a potential adverse impact on the macroeconomic situation and financial stability.
3.2 Macroprudential policy: safeguarding financial sector resilience in turbulent macro-financial conditions
The ECB has the task of assessing macroprudential capital measures proposed by national authorities for banks in countries participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Importantly, it also has the power to apply more stringent capital measures if necessary. The ECB’s close monitoring of national macroprudential policy stances in 2023 did not identify a need for this, as several countries had already implemented new macroprudential measures or tightened existing ones to strengthen the resilience of their banking systems to accumulated vulnerabilities and downside risks.
In 2023 financial stability concerns shifted towards the implications of higher interest rates and downside risks to growth. From a macroprudential perspective, tighter financial conditions drove a continued downturn in the financial cycle, but systemic risks did not materialise. Notably, banks’ capital positions remained strong, although the level of capital headroom varied across banks and countries, and credit supply constraints were not linked to banks’ capital requirements. Looking ahead, higher debt servicing costs and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment could challenge the debt servicing capacity of the non-financial sectors and gradually impair banks’ asset quality. This, together with lower lending volumes and rising funding costs, could have a negative impact on banks’ profitability and resilience.
Against this background,national authorities continued to tighten macroprudential policy 2023 in order to boost the resilience of banks. This was facilitated by banks’ profitability and capital headroom, which remained high on average despite the challenging macro-financial environment. Some national authorities activated the countercyclical capital buffer to address vulnerabilities linked to the build-up of credit risk and to create more macroprudential space in the form of releasable capital buffers. In 2023 eight countries introduced or tightened the countercyclical buffer, bringing the total number of countries that had implemented or announced a positive countercyclical buffer rate to 14 by the end of year. In addition, a total of 11 countries had implemented or announced either a broad or sectoral systemic risk buffer,[34]while banks in ten countries saw an increase in their O-SII buffers, in part owing to the ECB’s revised floor methodology.[35]Finally, 15 countries kept borrower-based measures in place to prevent banks’ excessive risk-taking in lending to households.
The ECB communicated its analysis and views on macroprudential policy topics in 2023. In the macroprudential policy chapters of the May and November issues of its Financial Stability Review, it highlighted the importance of preserving macroprudential buffers in case conditions in the banking sector deteriorate.[36]It also explained why existing borrower-based measures needed to remain in place and continue to act as structural backstops to ensure that lending standards do not deteriorate and that borrowers remain resilient. Furthermore, it suggested that high levels of banking sector profitability could provide an opportunity for some countries to implement additional targeted increases in macroprudential buffers, provided that procyclical effects were avoided. Last but not least, the ECB issued opinions explaining why imposing extraordinary taxes on credit institutions in some countries could have negative implications for financial stability.[37]
The ECB dedicated one issue of itsMacroprudential Bulletinto discussing the possible implementation of a positive neutral rate for the countercyclical buffer. Overall, experience from the pandemic suggests that the role of releasable macroprudential capital buffers needs to be enhanced to effectively address adverse systemic shocks that can occur independently of a country’s position in the financial or economic cycle. By the end of 2023 six countries had already implemented or announced frameworks for setting a positive neutral rate.[38]These frameworks were based on different approaches, which resulted in varying positive neutral rates. Over the medium term, a more harmonised approach towards setting positive neutral rates across banking union countries would seem desirable, as it would enhance consistency and effective policymaking while allowing for sufficient national flexibility. With regard to the NBFI sector, the ECB continued to call for a comprehensive set of policy measures to holistically address vulnerabilities in this sector. These measures should take existing frameworks into account and be rooted in strong international coordination.
In 2023 the ECB provided analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) Secretariat. Notably, the ECB co-chaired the ESRB’s Instruments Working Group (IWG), Analysis Working Group (AWG) and Task Force on Stress Testing, as well as the ECB/ESRB Project Team on climate risk monitoring. It also co-chaired the agile teams established under the AWG/Macroprudential Analysis Group (MPAG) and the IWG/Macroprudential Policy Group (MPPG) on the impact of higher inflation and rising interest rates on financial stability, and the AWG/MPAG agile team on systemic liquidity.
The ECB also supported the ESRB’s work on: (i) macroprudential tools for cyber resilience;[39](ii) systemic implications and policy options with regard to crypto-assets and decentralised finance;[40](iii) monitoring vulnerabilities related to NBFI;[41](iv) policy options to address risks in corporate debt and real estate investment funds;[42]v) vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate sector, on which the ESRB published a recommendation;[43]and (vi) macroprudential frameworks for managing climate risk.[44]More detailed information can be found on theESRB’s websiteand in itsAnnual Reports.
3.3 Microprudential activities to ensure the safety and soundness of individual banks
Notwithstanding the challenging macroeconomic environment, European banks remained resilient throughout 2023, including in the aftermath of the March turmoil, which was triggered by the failure of some regional banks in the United States and culminated in Europe with the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse overseen by the Swiss authorities. In a dedicateddata collection exercise conducted by the ECB and the EBA, banks reported €73 billion of net unrealised losses on debt securities at book value. This was considered a contained amount compared with the figure reported in the United States. Improved asset quality and profitability helped banks withstand the severe economic downturn in the adverse scenario of theECB’s 2023 stress test. This overall resilience is attributable to banks’ efforts over the years, to their diversified funding and good liquidity environment, and to the ECB’s continuous supervisory engagement, e.g. the work conducted on interest rate risk in the banking book since 2021. In the2023 Supervisory Review and Evaluation process (SREP), the overall SREP score remained broadly unchanged. The Pillar 2 requirements for CET1 capital were set at 1.2% on average, compared with 1.1% in 2022.
In spite of the SREP results and although European banks showed record profitability in 2023, the ECB sees no room for complacency. The gradually increasing pass-through of its policy rates to bank deposit rates and the broader increase in bank funding costs, as well as a deterioration in asset quality in the real estate sector and other interest rate sensitive sectors, could put the sustainability of high profits at risk. The ECB’s supervisory work remains focused on persistent weaknesses in risk management, governance and internal controls, and on emerging risks.
Over the course of 2023, ECB Banking Supervision became more risk-based and effective. On the basis of its internal work and theexpert group recommendations, the ECB implemented a new risk tolerance framework empowering supervisors to adapt and prioritise their activities according to the individual situation of the bank under their supervision, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach. In the same vein, it introduced a new multi-year assessment framework for the SREP, enabling supervisors to better calibrate the intensity and frequency of their analyses. It also started to develop more timely and forceful escalation processes, building on the full range of supervisory tools, including periodic penalty payments, for instance in the field of climate-related and environmental risks.[45]
Three banks were sanctioned by the ECB in 2023.[46]
In December 2023 the ECB published thesupervisory priorities for 2024-2026, which focus on (i) strengthening resilience to immediate macro-financial and geopolitical shocks, (ii) accelerating the effective remediation of shortcomings in governance and the management of climate-related and environmental risks, and (iii) furthering progress in digital transformation and building robust operational resilience frameworks.
As part of its continued efforts to enhance transparency, in 2023 the ECB published (i) itsfour-step approach to determine the Pillar 2 requirement on a risk-by-risk basis, (ii) thecredit risk SREP methodologyandmarket risk SREP methodologyfor application in the 2024 cycle, and (iii) theGuide to qualifying holding procedures; and in January 2024 it released an updated version of theSupervisory Manual, which was last published in 2018.
In April 2023 the ECB, together with the Single Resolution Board, welcomeda set of legislative changesto the European crisis management and deposit insurance framework that had been proposed by the European Commission.
In October 2023 Claudia Buch was appointed as the new Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, in accordance with the established institutional selection process.
More detailed information can be found on theECB’s banking supervision websiteand in the2023 ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities.
3.4 The ECB’s contribution to EU and international policy initiatives
Further progress was made in 2023 on improving the regulatory framework for the financial sector. The main achievements were (i) the agreement on the EU’s implementation of the final Basel III reforms, (ii) the initiatives to tackle climate-related risks, and (iii) the proposal to strengthen the EU’s crisis management and deposit insurance framework. Important headway was also made on regulating crypto-assets and on enhancing market infrastructure regulation, for example with regard to central clearing.
In 2023 the ECB continued to support the negotiations on the EU banking package, which comprises a set of amendments to theCapital Requirements Regulation (CRR)[47]and theCapital Requirements Directive (CRD)[48]aimed at implementing the final Basel III reforms in the EU. In December the preparatory bodies of the European Parliament and the EU Council endorsed the EU banking package. Adoption of the final CRR and CRD texts is expected by the end of April 2024 once the legal revision has been concluded. The reforms are intended to further bolster the resilience of the EU banking system, especially by increasing the capital needed to cover credit, operational and market risk exposures. They will also enhance the supervisory toolkit, including for addressing climate-related and other sustainability risks.[49]Furthermore, the ECB contributed to the EU sustainable finance agenda, notably by publishing opinions on a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence and a regulation on environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating activities.[50]
The discussions on completing the banking union focused on improving the EU’s crisis management and deposit insurance framework. On 18 April 2023 the European Commission published alegislative proposalaimed at strengthening bank crisis management in the EU and, in particular, at enhancing authorities’ options for handling the failure of smaller and medium-sized banks. The ECB strongly welcomed the legislative package in an opinion[51], stressing the need for better tools and funding options for crisis management. Beyond the proposed legislative package, the ECB called for further steps to complete the banking union. In particular, this requires establishing a European deposit insurance scheme and setting up a European framework for liquidity in resolution.
The ECB continued to support the finalisation and implementation of a regulatory framework for crypto-assets in 2023, at both the European and the international level. Following the entry into force in the EU of theMarkets in Crypto-assets Regulation[52]in June, the ECB provided input on a number of technical standards that were coordinated by theEuropean Banking AuthorityandEuropean Securities and Markets Authorityand aimed at implementing the Regulation. At the international level, it contributed to the progress made in international fora such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). Specifically, the FSB finalised itsGlobal Regulatory Framework for Crypto-asset Activities, providing high-level recommendations for regulating crypto-asset activities and markets, and for global stablecoin arrangements. These recommendations were incorporated into the broaderG20 roadmap on crypto-assets, which was adopted in October and had also benefited from ECB input. In addition, the ECB supported the work of the BCBS on tightening and clarifying aspects of itsstandard on banks’ exposures to crypto-assets. In particular, the adjustments tighten the criteria for stablecoins to receive a preferential regulatory treatment.
The ECB also continued to contribute actively to the finalisation of theEuropean Commission’s proposed legislative packageon anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), including the creation of an EU-level anti-money laundering authority. As outlined in its opinions,[53]the ECB supported close cooperation and information sharing between AML/CFT supervisors and European banking supervision, and more generally, an effective EU regime to counter the misuse of the EU financial system for money laundering and terrorism financing.
Legislative work continued in 2023 on initiatives to deepen the integration of the EU’s capital markets as part of theEuropean Commission’s 2020 capital markets union action plan. During the year the ECB contributed to the public policy debate on the future of the capital markets union in variouspublicationsandspeeches.[54]In addition, the ECB President, together with the Presidents of the Eurogroup, the European Investment Bank, the European Council and the European Commission published anop-ed on the importance of the capital markets union for channelling Europe’s savings into growth. The ECB also actively participated inEurogroup discussionson the future of European capital and financial markets, and contributed to the legislative process related to the review of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation.[55]
Furthermore, the ECB continued to highlight the importance of addressing structural vulnerabilities in NBFI and improving the relevant policy framework from a macroprudential perspective. Reviewing recent stress episodes in the NBFI sector, policy implications for the liquidity preparedness and leverage in this sector were discussed in its Financial Stability Review and Macroprudential Bulletin.[56]The ECB was also involved in the FSB’s assessment of the financial stability implications of leverage in NBFI and actively contributed to the ongoing policy work to enhance the resilience of NBFI.[57]With regard to open-ended funds, the ECB contributed to the revision of the FSB’s policy recommendations to address structural liquidity mismatch in such funds.[58]
The Eurosystem plays a central role in developing, operating and overseeing market infrastructures and payments. In 2023 the Eurosystem successfully renewed its wholesale payment system and continued developing TARGET Services. With a view to further enhancing integration and innovation in European payments and securities markets, the Eurosystem updated its retail payments strategy and started analysing the potential impact of emerging technologies on the settlement of wholesale financial transactions. In its work on exploring a potential digital euro, the Eurosystem moved from the investigation to the preparation phase.
4.1 TARGET Services
On 20 March 2023 the Eurosystem successfully launched its new T2 wholesale payment system, replacing the TARGET2 system in operation since November 2007. The T2 system introduces a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system, a central liquidity management function that optimises liquidity management across all TARGET Services, offering a set of common components that are shared across TARGET Services and extended operating hours. The migration took place between 17 and 20 March 2023, with all banks starting settlement in the new system in a “big bang” approach on Monday, 20 March 2023. The new system complies with the international standard for financial institution message exchange (ISO 20022) and brings significant efficiency gains. Moreover, the new T2 set-up enables market participants to streamline central bank money liquidity management for their euro transactions in wholesale and retail payments, as well as for securities settlement.
Approximately 1,000 banks use T2 to initiate transactions in euro, either on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers. Taking into account branches and subsidiaries, more than 40,000 banks worldwide can be reached via T2. In 2023 on average 409,444 payments per day with an average daily value of €2.2 trillion were processed using T2 and its predecessor TARGET2. This was a 2.9% increase in the daily volume of payments compared with payments made using TARGET2 in 2022.
From 1 January 2023, following Croatia’s accession to the euro area, the Croatian financial community migrated from its national RTGS system to TARGET2/T2.Onboarding of the Croatian market to TARGET Servicescontinued in June with themigration to the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) serviceand in September, when the Croatian central securities depository (CSD) joined TARGET2-Securities (T2S).
The Croatian CSD was onboarded as part of a wave in whichfive CSDs successfully joined the T2S platform, including Euroclear Bank, one of the largest CSDs in the world, the Bulgarian National Bank Government Securities Settlement System and Central Depository AD, the other CSD operating in Bulgaria, Središnje klirinško depozitarno društvo d.d. (SKDD) in Croatia and Euroclear Finland. The T2S platform now connects 24 CSDs from 23 European markets, allowing securities settlement in euro and Danish krone. This migration wave was an important development for T2S and the Eurosystem from the operational, business and strategic perspectives. In particular, the successful inclusion of a CSD (Euroclear Finland) that maintains end-investor accounts reconfirms that Eurosystem market infrastructures can support all EU markets and jurisdictions. Additionally, from a business perspective, the migration of Euroclear Bank brings Eurobond instruments directly into T2S and, as of 2024, into the Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS). In 2023, T2S processed on average 699,868 transactions per day with an average daily value of €790.3 billion.
TIPS continued to play an important role in the development of instant payments in euro, with more banks and national communities joining in 2023. The growth in the number of participants in TIPS led to a rise in transaction volumes of more than 127% compared with 2022, with a peak of 28 million instant payments settled in December 2023 (compared with 18.7 million in December 2022).Testing for theconnection of Sveriges Riksbank and the Swedish krona to TIPS for instant payments in 2024 was successfully completed. The collaboration between the Eurosystem and Danmarks Nationalbank to connect the Danish krone to TIPS (and T2) in 2025 continued smoothly.
In July 2023 the Eurosystem published anew pricing structure for TIPSthat entered into force on 1 January 2024. It ensures that the service operates on a cost recovery basis, without making a profit. At the same time, the pricing of TIPS aims to support the take-up of instant payments in Europe, which is also expected to accelerate, given thelegislative proposalput forward by the European Commission to make instant payments in euro available to all citizens and businesses holding a bank account in the EU and in European Economic Area countries.
In addition to the three settlement services (T2, T2S and TIPS), the Eurosystem is developing a new TARGET Service, the ECMS, which will be a unified system for managing the assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations for all euro area jurisdictions.Thelaunch of the ECMShas been moved from April 2024 to November 2024 to give users more time to complete testing of the ECMS functionalities in a stable environment.
4.2 Digital euro project
The two-year investigation phase of the digital euro project concluded in October 2023. Thestocktake of the work conducted during the investigation phaseformed the basis for theECB Governing Council’s decision to launch the preparation phase. The start of this new phase does not imply a decision on whether to issue a digital euro. That decision can only be considered by the Governing Council after the adoption of thelegislative framework for the digital euroat the EU level.
During the investigation phase, the Eurosystem agreed on thehigh-level design and technical requirements for a digital euro. The work was supported by aprototyping exerciseto validate the proposed design from a technical perspective and through focus group research[59]to gain input on the preferences and expectations of potential users. Close and transparent engagement with market participants, other EU institutions and policymakers ensured that all stakeholders could provide their feedback on design and distribution options.Market researchon technical aspects showed that there is a sufficiently large pool of European providers able to develop digital euro solutions and that a variety of architectural and technological design options are available.
The first stage of the preparation phase, which started on 1 November 2023, will last two years and will lay the foundations for the potential issuance of a digital euro. During this timeframe, the focus will be on finalising the digital euro rulebook and selecting providers that could potentially develop a digital euro platform and infrastructure. The Eurosystem will also conduct further testing and experimentation, and will continue to consult with all stakeholders – including the public – to ensure that a digital euro meets the highest standards of quality, security, privacy and usability.
Possible subsequent steps will be decided by the Governing Council based on the results of the first stage of the preparation phase and developments in the legislative process.
4.3 Innovation and integration of market infrastructure and payments
In November 2023 the Eurosystem published an update of itsretail payments strategyin the light of the significant changes in the payment landscape in the four years since its launch. In particular, Big Tech has increased activities in the payment area, potentially negatively affecting Europe’s strategic autonomy in payments. In addition, Russia’s war against Ukraine underscored the relevance of (cyber) risks to critical infrastructures in Europe, including for payment services. Moreover, considerable progress was made on the digital euro project.
The updated strategy retains its main goals, namely to develop pan-European solutions for payments at the point of interaction (i.e. at the physical point of sale and in the mobile and e-commerce space) and to further strengthen the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), primarily through full deployment of instant payments. It also includes a new goal to increase the resilience of retail payments, including by having alternative payment solutions available as a contingency. Finally, the complementarity between the Eurosystem’s retail payments strategy and the digital euro project is also underlined, in particular the various ways in which a digital euro could contribute to meeting the goals of the strategy. For example, a digital euro would offer a pan-European payment solution in itself, while also helping private retail payment solutions achieve a pan-European reach.
In line with its goal to further European financial market integration in the post-trading area and to contribute to achieving capital markets union, the Eurosystem’s Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) continued to report on the progress made by AMI-SeCo markets (the European Economic Area and UK and Swiss markets) on compliance with the standards under the T2S Harmonisation Agenda, the Single Collateral management Rulebook for Europe (SCoRE) (which is also necessary for interacting with ECMS), and corporate events standards (including standards on shareholder identification). The overall compliance rate with theT2S harmonisation standardsremained at around 90%. The five new CSDs that joined T2S in September 2023 were assessed as having a high level of compliance with the T2S harmonisation standards. The 2023Corporate Events Compliance Reportprovided evidence that progress has also been made on compliance with the corporate events standards. In theSCoREBoard reportfor the second half of 2023, AMI-SeCo noted some delays in progress by stakeholders on complying with the applicable SCoRE standards. In view of the rescheduling of the go-live of the Eurosystem’s ECMS to November 2024, the AMI-SeCo agreed to defer the deadline for compliance with the relevant SCoRE standards.
With a view to identifying remaining barriers to securities post-trade market integration in the EU, AMI-SeCo launched a survey among its members and the members of the National Stakeholder Groups in November 2023. AMI-SeCo also provided input to the European Commission and the European Council on the post-trade aspects of theproposal by the Commission for more efficient cross-border withholding tax proceduresand communicated its views on the potential shortening of the standard T+2 securities settlement cycle to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
Lastly, the Eurosystem has started analysing the potential impact of emerging technologies, including distributed ledger technology (DLT), on the settlement of wholesale financial transactions (see Box 4).
4.4 Oversight and the role of central bank of issue
The safe and efficient functioning of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and payments in the euro area is an ongoing priority for the Eurosystem in its oversight capacity. In addition, as central bank of issue for the euro, the Eurosystem is involved in cooperative arrangements for FMIs outside the euro area with meaningful euro-denominated activities.
As regards oversight of the Eurosystem’s TARGET Services (see Section 4.1), key priorities included monitoring the T2-T2S consolidation project ahead of its go-live in March 2023 and the onboarding of new markets. Furthermore, comprehensive assessments of T2/TIPS against the Regulation on oversight requirements for systemically important payment systems (SIPS) and of T2S against the CPMI-IOSCO Principles were launched in October 2023.
The Eurosystem also oversees other SIPS, including EURO1, STEP2-T and the MasterCard Clearing Management System (MCMS). In 2023 it focused on finalisation of the first comprehensive assessment of the MCMS against the SIPS Regulation, the launch of new comprehensive assessments of EURO1 and STEP2-T against the SIPS Regulation, assessment of the MCMS against thecyber resilience oversight expectationsfor financial market infrastructures (CROE) and monitoring of the EURO1 migration to the ISO 20022 standard.
With respect topayment instruments, payment schemes and payment arrangements, in 2023 the Eurosystem reached a major milestone in identifying thepayment arrangements to be overseen or monitored under the Eurosystem’s frameworkfor the oversight of electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA framework). In addition to onboarding newly overseen entities under the PISA framework, the Eurosystem conducted a comprehensive assessment of the first group of pan-European schemes and continued its work oncard fraud monitoring.
As central bank of issue for the euro, the Eurosystem continued to be involved in cooperative oversight and crisis management arrangements for FMIs with material euro-denominated activities. As regards central counterparties (CCPs), the Eurosystem contributed to assessing risk management changes, proposals for the extension of services, recovery plans and resolution plans. With regard to securities settlement, the Eurosystem continued to give input on the regular evaluation of CSDs under the Central Securities Depository Regulation and to prepare for the future authorisation of entities operating DLT-based market infrastructures under Regulation (EU) No 2022/858 (DLT Pilot Regime Regulation).
In the area of cyber resilience, the review of the Eurosystem cyber resilience strategy for FMIs was finalised, with details on enhancements and revisions to be announced in early 2024. In addition, the ESCB conducted its periodic cyber resilience survey across 80 FMIs in the EU and initiated follow-up with the respective overseers and overseen entities.
The ECB supported various oversight-related global workstreams (for example, on CCP margining practices, FMI safeguards for financial risks unrelated to participant default and stablecoin arrangements), as well as theEU-wide CCP supervisory stress testcoordinated by ESMA. The ECB also publishedan overview of EU CCPs’ initial margin models, continuously monitored the impact of increased market volatility on CCPs and their members and organised, together with the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the2023 Joint Conference on CCP risk managementto facilitate discussion between the industry, regulatory bodies and academia.
The Eurosystem regularly contributes to developing new EU regulations for FMIs and payments. In particular, in 2023 it provided input to theECB Opinion on the review of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. The ECB also actively contributed to preparing secondary legislation for theDigital Operational Resilience Act, notably in the area of threat-led penetration testing being developed in accordance with theEuropean framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming(TIBER-EU).
The Eurosystem approved a new framework for the provision of euro liquidity lines to non-euro area central banks in August 2023andkept in place several liquidity lines with non-euro area central banks, thereby providing a backstop to market-based funding. The ECB continued to offer US dollar operations to euro area counterparties on a regular basis. No ECB interventions took place in the foreign exchange market. The ECB remained responsible for the administration of various financial operations on behalf of the European Union and played a coordinating role in relation to the Eurosystem reserve management services framework.
5.1 Developments in market operations
The Eurosystem’s swap and repo lines are monetary policy instruments. They help prevent tensions in international funding markets from hampering the effectiveness of euro area monetary policy transmission. Table 5.1 shows the liquidity lines in operation as of 31 December 2023.
In 2023 the ECB continued to provide US dollar liquidity on a weekly basis with a seven-day tenor in coordination with the Federal Reserve System, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank (the swap line network). From 20 March to 30 April 2023 the frequency of the seven-day dollar providing operations was increased to daily in a coordinated manner with the central banks of the swap line network. The higher frequency was intended to enhance effectiveness and strengthened the backstop role of the operation in a period of elevated pressure in US dollar funding conditions. Borrowing by euro area counterparties remained limited throughout the year.
On 3 August 2023 the Governing Council approved anew framework for the provision of euro liquidity lines to non-euro area central banks, following an in-depth review of the previous framework in place and based on experience in recent years. The new framework came into effect on 16 January 2024 and upholds the role of liquidity lines as monetary policy instruments, retains the fundamental elements of the framework in place so far but streamlines it, and integrates existing repo facilities into a unified permanent framework called EUREP. Swap lines are available to countries of highest creditworthiness or systemic importance from a euro area perspective. Access to a euro liquidity line might differ in normal times from periods of acute, broad-based financial market distress, when the establishment of precautionary lines with a broader set of countries could be warranted. The Governing Council will continue to assess requests for liquidity lines on a case-by-case basis.
The ECB did not intervene in the foreign exchange market in 2023. Since the inception of the euro, the ECB has intervened in the foreign exchange market twice – in 2000 and 2011. Data on foreign exchange interventions are published on a quarterly basis with a delay of one quarter on the ECB’s website and in the Statistical Data Warehouse. The information published in the quarterly table is also recapped in Table 5.2. If there were no foreign exchange interventions in the relevant quarter, this is explicitly stated.
The reporting framework covers foreign exchange interventions carried out by the ECB unilaterally and in coordination with other international authorities, as well as interventions “at the margins” within the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II).
5.2 Administration of EU borrowing and lending operations
The ECB is responsible for the administration of accounts and processing of payments relating to the borrowing and lending operations of the EU under the medium-term financial assistance (MTFA) facility[60], theEuropean financial stabilisation mechanism(EFSM)[61], theEuropean instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency(SURE)[62], theNext Generation EU(NGEU) programme[63]and themacro-financial assistance to Ukraine programme(MFA+)[64]. The ECB is also responsible for the administration of certain payments arising in connection with operations under theEuropean Financial Stability Facility(EFSF)[65]and theEuropean Stability Mechanism(ESM)[66]and for processing all payments in relation to the loan facility agreement for Greece[67]. In 2023 the ECB completed its preparations to perform paying agent services for the European Commission, thereby extending the ECB’s current fiscal agent services.
As at 31 December 2023 the total outstanding nominal amount was €200 million under the MTFA facility, €42.8 billion under the EFSM, €98.4 billion under SURE and €39.54 billion under the loan facility agreement for Greece. Finally, in 2023 the ECB processed disbursements and interest payments of NGEU loans and grants to and from various Member States and MFA+ loans to Ukraine.
5.3 Eurosystem reserve management services
In 2023 a comprehensive set of financial services continued to be offered within theEurosystem reserve management services(ERMS) framework established in 2005 for the management of customers’ euro-denominated reserve assets. A number of Eurosystem national central banks provide financial services within this framework ‒ under harmonised terms and conditions and in line with market standards ‒ to central banks, monetary authorities and government agencies located outside the euro area, as well as to international organisations. The ECB performs an overall coordinating role, monitors the smooth functioning of the services, promotes changes to improve the framework and prepares related reports for the ECB’s decision-making bodies.
The number of customer accounts reported in the ERMS stood at 273 at the end of 2023, compared with 270 at the end of 2022. The total aggregated holdings (including cash assets and securities holdings) managed within the ERMS framework decreased by approximately 20% in 2023 compared with 2022.
Euro banknote circulation has been affected by rises in the ECB’s key interest rates as cash holdings as a store of value decreased. A clear majority of European citizens find it important to have the option to pay in cash. Accordingly, the ECB aims to ensure effective access to and acceptance of cash in the euro area.
The Eurosystem is also committed to ensuring that cash remains as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible and has assessed the environmental footprint of banknotes as a mean of payment. The preparations for the development of a new series of euro banknotes are an opportunity to make euro banknotes more relatable to all Europeans. The public is therefore consulted throughout the design process.
6.1 Circulation of euro banknotes and ensuring access to and acceptance of cash
At the end of 2023 euro banknote circulation reached 29.8 billion pieces and a total value of €1.57 trillion. The increases in the ECB’s key interest rates since July 2022 have continued to have a dampening effect on holding cash as a store of value, since banknotes do not yield any interest. Accordingly, 2023 was marked by very low annual growth rates of 1.2% and -0.3% in terms of the number and value of banknotes respectively.
To maintain the quality of euro banknotes in circulation as well as trust in them, Eurosystem national central banks processed 25.3 billion euro banknotes and replaced 3.3 billion worn-out banknotes with newly printed ones.
The value of euro coin circulation grew by 3.2% annually to reach €33.5 billion at the end of 2023, equivalent to 148.2 billion euro coins.
In 2022 the ECB conducted astudy on payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area, which showed that 60% of citizens consider it important to have the option to pay in cash. To ensure effective access to and acceptance of cash, on 28 June 2023 the European Commission adopted aproposal for a regulation on the legal tender of euro banknotes and coins. In itsOpinion on the Commission proposal, the ECB voiced its strong support for establishing clear rules on the mandatory acceptance of euro cash and on refusals of cash acceptance by retailers, for example “no cash” signs at shop entrances. Good access to and acceptance of cash are the key components of theEurosystem 2030 cash strategyto ensure that euro cash continues to be widely available as an attractive, reliable and competitive means of payment and store of value.
6.2 Study on the environmental footprint of euro banknotes
The ECB conducted aProduct Environmental Footprint study of euro banknotesto assess the environmental footprint of a person’s yearly cash payments using euro banknotes to ensure that cash remains as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible.
The findings showed that the footprint of a person’s yearly use of euro banknotes is equivalent to driving eight kilometres by car and accounts for only 0.01% of their total annual environmental impact related to consumption activities.
Banknotes are reused several times once they are put into circulation. The distribution stage, including energy consumption and transportation, is the main contributor to their environmental footprint. The use of sustainable cotton in banknote paper has reduced the environmental impact of euro banknotes by almost 50% and the overall footprint of paying with euro banknotes by 3.6% compared to using conventional cotton from non-sustainable sources. Further reductions are foreseen once the move to more organic cotton takes place. Extensive research and development are underway to identify alternative waste disposal methods for banknotes, such as recycling and reusing waste material.
6.3 Development of euro banknote counterfeiting
Some 467,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2023, one of the lowest levels ever in proportion to total banknotes in circulation (Chart 6.2). In 2023, 16 counterfeits were detected per million genuine banknotes in circulation. Despite this very small proportion, the number of counterfeit banknotes increased compared with 2022, when the number of counterfeits was exceptionally low following the COVID-19 pandemic. There is little likelihood of receiving a counterfeit. Most counterfeits are of low quality with no or only very poor imitations of security features. Notes can be checked using the simple “feel, look and tilt” method described on thebanknote security featuresweb page and on the websites of the euro area national central banks.
6.4 Preparations for future euro banknotes
The ECB is preparing to develop a new series of euro banknotes with a view to maintaining their high resilience to counterfeiting and making them as environmentally friendly as possible. This process reflects the Eurosystem’s commitment to cash and is an opportunity to make euro banknotes more relatable to all Europeans.
A multidisciplinary advisory group – with members from all euro area countries – proposed a shortlist of themes based on input from the public. The Governing Council subsequently selected seven themes, and the public was invited to express their preferences. Based on the outcome of two public surveys in summer 2023, the Governing Council selected “European culture” and “Rivers and birds” as two possible themes for future euro banknotes.
In addition, the Governing Council decided to establish an advisory group to propose motifs that could illustrate the selected themes by the end of 2024. After that, a competition will be held to design the new banknotes. European citizens will again have the chance to express their preferences on several design options. The ECB is expected to decide in 2026 on the final designs and on when to produce and issue the new banknotes. Once a decision to produce new banknotes has been taken, it will still be several years before the first banknotes are issued.
The ECB – assisted by the national central banks (NCBs) – develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide range of statistics and data needed to support the ECB’s monetary policy, as well as financial stability-related and other tasks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Systemic Risk Board. These statistics are also used by public authorities, international organisations, financial market participants, the media and the general public, and help the ECB to increase the transparency of its work.
In 2023 the ECB focused on new euro area statistics, namely detailed reporting on external statistics and breakdowns on the loans, currency and deposits component of government debt. The ECB also decided to expand the reporting population for Money Market Statistical Reporting and published new statistics on financial accounts with a breakdown of life insurance and pension entitlements by investment risk. As part of itsclimate action plan, the ECB published climate-related indicators on itswebsite.In addition, the Eurosystem launched a survey to assess which topics could be included in the scope of the Integrated Reporting Framework.
7.1New and enhanced euro area statistics and other developments
In April 2023 the ECB started publishing additional details on external statistics in line with the amendedECB Guideline on external statistics, addressing the needs of users for more detailed cross-border statistics. The new series separate data for investment funds, insurance corporations and pension funds, other financial institutions, non-financial corporations, and combined households and non-profit institutions serving households. They also identify the type of debt instrument employed for direct investment. Additional details are available for debt securities, loans and trade credits and advances, and additional geographic counterparts.
Furthermore, the ECB started to release new breakdowns for the loans, currency and deposits component of EU Member States’ government debt, which allows for a more thorough evaluation of government financing. While debt securities typically make up the largest share of government debt, loans and deposits are significant components, equivalent to about 16% of euro area GDP in 2022 and 17.5% of total government debt. The data show the various sources of funding and provide a breakdown by creditor category, including commercial banks, multilateral institutions (such as the International Monetary Fund) and the European Union institutions (for example the European Investment Bank).
In April 2023 the ECB decided to expand the reporting population for Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR), adding 24 new banks to the 46 banks already reporting. The new MMSR banks will start reporting on 1 July 2024. The data they provide will help make the MMSR data published by the ECB more representative. Data from the new reporting agents will be included in the calculation of the euro short-term rate (€STR) at a later stage to ensure that the newly reported data are of a sufficiently high quality. The expanded reporting population will support the representativeness, robustness and reliability of the benchmark.
Following the amendment of itsGuideline on the statistical reporting requirements for quarterly financial accounts, in October 2023 the ECB started publishingnew breakdowns for life insurance, annuity entitlements and pension entitlements by allocation of investment riskfor all EU Member States and the euro area. These entitlements are substantial components of household financial assets and are recorded in the financial accounts as liabilities of insurance corporations and pension funds (and to a much lesser extent of other sectors). The new data show to what extent households bear the investment risk of the premiums and contributions invested on their behalf.
7.2 Publication of new climate-related statistical indicators
In January 2023 the ECB published a first set of experimental and analyticalclimate change-related statistical indicatorson its website. These indicators were collated in close cooperation with ESCB national central banks and are part of the ECB’s broaderclimate action plan.
The experimental sustainable finance indicators give an overview of debt instruments with sustainability characteristics that are issued or held by residents in the euro area. They provide information on the proceeds raised to finance sustainable projects and, by extension, the transition to a net-zero economy.
Analytical carbon emission indicators for financial institutions supply information on the carbon-intensity of the securities and loan portfolios of financial institutions and thus help to assess the sector’s role in financing the transition to a net-zero economy and the associated risks. The indicators provide information on banks’ exposure to counterparties with a high dependence on carbon emission-intensive business models.
Analytical indicators on the physical risks in loan and security portfolios assess risks stemming from the impact of climate change-induced natural hazards, such as floods and wildfires, on the performance of loans, bonds and equities. The indicators can be used to compare physical risk across countries, sectors and hazards.
Work continued on all three datasets to further enhance the quality of the data and breakdowns available, including geographical, sectoral and other details.
7.3Making banks’ data reporting more efficient
The Integrated reporting Framework (IReF) seeks to integrate existing ESCB statistical data requirements for banks as far as possible into a single, standardised reporting framework applicable across the euro area.
The IReF is a first step towards a broader initiative for an integrated reporting system for statistical, prudential and resolution data in the European Union, as requested by the European banking industry and solicited by the European Parliament and the Council. The European Banking Authority, the ECB, the Single Resolution Board and the European Commission work together in an informal coordination group to further promote such integration. In 2023 they discussed the working modalities for a Joint Bank Reporting Committee (JBRC), involving relevant European and national authorities as well as the banking industry. The JBRC is expected to be set up in 2024.
The ESCB is also cooperating closely with the banking industry to optimise reporting and reduce the overall reporting burden via theBanks’ Integrated Reporting Dictionary(BIRD). This is a voluntary and collaborative initiative that brings together the ESCB national central banks and commercial banks. BIRD – which can be accessed free of charge – helps banks to generate statistical, supervisory and resolution-related reporting output that complies with the reporting requirements set out in European legislation. BIRD is an integrated dictionary with redundancy-free content: the concepts underlying reporting obligations are all identified and described once, helping banks to decide which data to extract from their internal systems and how to process them.
One of BIRD’s first deliverables will be to help banks comply with the IReF – a new data collection framework that will apply consistently across all euro area countries. Reporting agents will be able to use BIRD for IReF reporting, as well as other reporting obligations. BIRD will help to reduce banks’ reporting burden and improve the quality of the data reported to the relevant authorities.
In 2023 ECB research focused, among other things, on assessing inflation developments, monetary transmission, climate change, and structural change. More specifically, the Heads of Research of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) launched the Research Network on Challenges for Monetary Policy Transmission in a Changing World (ChaMP) aimed at using rich granular datasets to analyse the strength, speed and heterogeneity of monetary transmission channels in the euro area amid unprecedented shocks, structural changes and shifting inflation dynamics. The Household Finance and Consumption Network (HFCN) continued to deliver new insights into the impact of inflation on heterogeneous households across the euro area. The ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) is now firmly established as a source of valuable policy and research insights into the formation of household expectations. Climate change continued to be an important topic for ECB research activities. The ECB also collaborated closely with national central banks within the ESCB research clusters, organising annual workshops to discuss the most pressing issues in the different fields of specialisation.
8.1 Update on ESCB research initiatives
The ChaMP Network started work in May 2023. It is foreseen to last for two years, with a possible extension of one additional year. The Network is structured in two workstreams: transmission of monetary policy via the financial system (WS1) and transmission of monetary policy via the real economy (WS2). The ChaMP Network started with an initial work programme encompassing 180 research projects by over 250 authors from most central banks in the ESCB. The first workshops were held in Brussels on 25 October 2023 (WS2) and in Lisbon on 31 October 2023 (WS1). The WS1 workshop included presentations on the transmission of monetary policy via banks to corporations and households and on the role of non-bank financial intermediaries, while the WS2 workshop focused on the relevance of production networks between firms (for example supply constraints and other shocks) and of structural changes (for example digitalisation, (de)globalisation and climate change) for the transmission of monetary policy. The first in-person meeting of the leadership team took place in Lisbon on 30 October 2023.
The HFCN released the results of the fourth (2021) wave of theHousehold Finance and Consumption Survey(HFCS) in July 2023. The HFCS is a useful source of household-level information on household finances and consumption for several research projects conducted by HFCN members, the ECB’s Research Taskforce on Heterogeneity and external researchers. These projects include work on the distributional effects of inflation shocks on household balance sheets,[68]differences in holdings of wealth between men and women (the gender wealth gap), measuring income uncertainty using expectations data, the heterogeneity of the effects of the pandemic on household finances, and the new Distributional Wealth Accounts (see Box 5).
8.2 Update on ECB research initiatives
The ECB’sConsumer Expectations Survey (CES)was further developed in 2023, offering fresh household-sector insights for policy analysis and research. The ECB extended the survey’s coverage beyond the initial six countries (Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) in the pilot phase to include five additional euro area countries (Austria, Finland, Greece, Ireland and Portugal). The CES proved to be an invaluable policy and research tool for analysing household inflation expectations. Research showed that restrictive monetary policy together with active communication on the role of monetary policy in stabilising future inflation promoted public trust and prevented recent price and cost shocks from becoming entrenched in consumer inflation expectations.[69]The CES was also used to highlight the heterogenous impact of inflation on expectations across households. One important finding is that low-income households were most affected by inflation owing to their exposure to increases in the prices of necessities such as energy and food.
Climate-related research topics remained very prominent in 2023. Research provided evidence of a disconnect, whereby banks with more extensive environmental disclosures extended more credit to polluting borrowers, without charging higher interest rates or shortening debt maturities.[70]Other work focused on the unintended consequences of carbon taxes. Analysis of the risk of “greenflation” (persistent deviations of inflation from our target stemming from carbon taxes or carbon pricing schemes) suggests that when carbon taxes are increased very slowly, decarbonisation can be achieved without endangering the ECB’s mandate.[71]Other work has shown that carbon pricing mechanisms reduce firms’ carbon emissions but also tilt their investment mix away from green innovation to short-term pollution abatement.[72]The effects of climate change on our understanding of macroeconomic and financial stability were also at the core of the policy panel discussion featured by the“WE_ARE_IN” conferencejointly organised with the Centre for Economic Policy Research.
In 2023 ECB staff published 120 papers in the ECB’s Working Paper Series. In addition, more policy-oriented or methodological studies were published in the ECB’s Occasional Paper Series, Statistics Paper Series and Discussion Paper Series. Many of the ECB’s research activities also resulted in publications in renowned academic journals, while 12 articles were released in the ECB’s Research Bulletin targeting a more general audience. Box 7 describes in more detail the results of recent ECB work on the economic dynamics after extreme events – a topic of great importance for both price and financial stability.
8.3 Update on the work of ESCB research clusters
Regular research networks continued coordinating research efforts within the ESCB and maintaining relations with academic researchers. In particular, the ESCB research clusters on “Monetary economics” (Cluster 1), “International macroeconomics, fiscal policy, labour economics, competitiveness and EMU governance” (Cluster 2), “Financial stability, macroprudential regulation and microprudential supervision” (Cluster 3) and “Climate change” (Cluster 4) held workshops on the most pressing issues in their fields. The annual workshop of Cluster 1 in 2023 was postponed and will now be held at Narodowy Bank Polski in Warsaw on 21-22 March 2024. Cluster 2 held its annual workshop at the Bank of England on 16-17 November 2023. It featured five sessions focusing on productivity, labour markets, international macroeconomics, energy shocks, and climate policy and fiscal policy. Cluster 3 ran its annual workshop in Saariselkä, Finland on 23-25 November 2023, focusing on financial stability and financial intermediation. Cluster 4 held its second annual workshop in hybrid format at the ECB on 13-14 November 2023. The topics discussed ranged from the effect of temperature shocks on inflation to the dynamics of biodiversity.
This chapter deals with the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concerning the ECB, provides information on ECB opinions and cases of non-compliance with the obligation to consult the ECB on draft legislation falling within its fields of competence. It also reports on the ECB’s monitoring of compliance with the prohibition of monetary financing and privileged access.
9.1 Jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning the ECB
In September 2023 the CJEU dismissed the appeal in the last pending action for damages brought against the ECB and the European Union (EU) by holders of Greek sovereign bonds. The appellants were subject to the restructuring of the Greek public debt in 2012 by means of the activation of retrofit collective action clauses.[75]At first instance, the appellants alleged that their forced participation in the restructuring of the Greek public debt was attributable to the ECB and the EU owing to, among other things, the involvement of the ECB and EU in the Eurogroup meetings and their role in the consultation process leading to the activation of retrofit collective action clauses.[76]The General Court found that the ECB and the EU did not act ultra vires and did not commit any breach of the right to property, the free movement of capital or the principle of equal treatment. The General Court also held that several provisions of theTreaty on the Functioning of the European Unioninvoked by the applicants (including Articles 123 and 127) do not constitute rules of law conferring rights on individuals and therefore cannot give rise to non-contractual liability on the part of either the EU or the ECB. The appeal, which alleged erroneous examination of certain pleas by the General Court, was dismissed by the CJEU in its entirety, thus putting an end to more than a decade of litigation in which the ECB has always prevailed by demonstrating that it acted lawfully.
In April 2023 the CJEU (Fifth Chamber) delivered itsjudgment in a preliminary ruling procedure submitted by the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania(Case C-772/21). The CJEU interpreted that the ECB’s minimum standards for automated checking of the fitness of euro banknotes by banknote handling machines, referred to in Article 6(2) ofECB Decision (ECB/2010/14) on fitness checking of euro banknotes, do not apply to cash handlers, such as Brink’s Lithuania. In the main proceedings, Brink’s challenged Lietuvos bankas’ decision according to which Brink’s was in breach of the ECB’s minimum standards, as two of its banknote handling machines had failed the fitness test (which was based on such standards). The CJEU determined that the ECB’s minimum standards apply to the manufacturers of banknote handling machines. While cash handlers are not bound by those standards, they remain obliged to remedy a situation where an inspection by a national central bank (NCB) finds that banknote handling machines do not comply with the ECB’s minimum standards. The CJEU also concluded that Member States are precluded from obliging cash handlers to comply with the ECB’s minimum standards, as introducing such an obligation under national law would not respect the EU’s exclusive competence in the area of monetary policy, which includes checking the authenticity and fitness of banknotes.
In May 2023 the CJEU clarified the scope of judicial review from EU courts over the ECB decision adopted in the field of banking supervision on the basis of a discretionary power involving complex technical, economic and financial assessments. The ruling of the CJEU followed an appeal by the ECB against the judgment of the General Court of April 2021 by which it annulled the ECB’s decision refusing to authorise Crédit Lyonnais to exclude from the calculation of its leverage ratio certain exposures deriving from the amounts collected on regulated saving accounts. The General Court considered that the decision was vitiated by a manifest error of assessment because the ECB failed to take into account that those accounts were not subject to a risk of massive withdrawals and, as a consequence, were not exposing the bank to a risk of fire sales. The CJEU, upholding the ECB’s arguments, annulled the judgment of the General Court, ruling that the scope of judicial review from EU courts over ECB decisions adopted on the basis of a discretionary power must be limited and not lead the General Court substituting its own assessment for that of the ECB. That review must only seek to ascertain that the decision is not based on materially incorrect facts or vitiated by a manifest error of assessment or misuse of powers. In the case at hand, the CJEU considered that the General Court substituted its own assessment regarding the risk of fire sales of assets to which the bank was exposed for that of the ECB and, as a consequence, overstepped the limits of judicial review. Giving final judgment in the case, the CJEU dismissed Crédit Lyonnais’s action at first instance in annulment of the contested decision, ruling that the bank failed to demonstrate that the ECB decision was vitiated by a manifest error of assessment.
In September 2023 the CJEU[77]dismissed the appeal of Versobank AS against the judgment of the General Court of 6 October 2021, which had rejected the annulment action against the ECB’s decision to withdraw the bank’s authorisation to operate as a credit institution. In this judgment, the CJEU confirmed that the ECB has exclusive competence to withdraw the banking licence of all credit institutions established in participating Member States, regardless of their classification as significant institutions or less significant institutions, including on grounds relating to serious breaches of the national legislation transposing the AML Directive.
9.2 ECB opinions and cases of non-compliance
Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union require that the ECB be consulted on any proposed EU or draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence. All ECB opinions are published onEUR-Lex. In 2023 the ECB adopted 12 opinions on proposed Union legal acts and 35 opinions on draft national legislation.
Twelve cases of non-compliance with the obligation to consult the ECB on draft legislation were recorded: two in respect of Union legal acts and ten in respect of national laws. The ECB adopted own initiative opinions in respect of seven of these twelve cases.
The first EU case concerned an EU proposal for a regulation on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data (Data Act). This case was considered to be clear and important because it concerns, among other things, the scope of access to and use of privately held data by the ECB and the NCBs for a number of defined public interest purposes. The second EU case concerned an EU legislative package proposing the establishment of a European Single Access Point (ESAP) providing centralised access to publicly available information of relevance to financial services, capital markets and sustainability. This case was considered to be clear and important because the establishment of an ESAP is an important milestone in the completion of the capital markets union, which should allow for a more efficient allocation of capital across the Union, contributing to the further development and integration of capital markets.
Two Hungarian non-compliance cases concerned central bank independence and the prohibition of monetary financing. The first Hungarian case concerned a Hungarian law on economic and financial measures, which prohibited certain institutions from purchasing, until 30 June 2023, a Hungarian forint-denominated debt instrument issued by an ESCB national central bank. This case was considered to be clear and important because it impedes theMagyar Nemzeti Bank from independently choosing the necessary means and instruments to conduct an efficient monetary policy and to independently achieve its primary objective of price stability. The second Hungarian case concerned amendments of the Law on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank introducing single foreign currency treasury accounts, which will be managed by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank, to supplement the already existing single Hungarian forint treasury account. This case was considered to be clear and important because it concerns the compliance of the remuneration of the State’s treasury accounts of an NCB with the monetary financing prohibition.
Two Slovak non-compliance cases concerned cash. The first Slovak case concerned a Slovak law on social insurance limiting cash payments for public social insurance contributions. This case was considered to be clear and important owing to the limitation it imposes on the use of cash as a means of payment and the absence of a proportionality assessment of this limitation, taking into account the criteria established by the CJEU in itsHessischer Rundfunk judgment(C-422/19 and C-423/19). The second Slovak case concerned a Slovak law amending the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, which guarantees the issuance of cash as legal tender, further specifies that everyone has the right to make a payment for the purchase of goods and the provision of services using cash as legal tender, guarantees that the acceptance of such payment may only be refused for reasonable or generally applicable reasons, and guarantees the right to perform a cash transaction in a bank or a branch of a foreign bank. This case was considered to be clear and important because the constitutional law guarantees the issuance of cash as legal tender and in this context sets out a general principle of mandatory acceptance of cash and a framework for exemptions in a Member State whose currency is the euro, which are matters falling within the exclusive competence of the ECB and the Union.
Five national non-compliance cases (four non-consultations and one late consultation) relate to special purpose bank tax and levies introduced in response to increased inflation and interest rates. These cases concerned: (1) a Polish law on crowdfunding for business ventures and assistance to borrowers, which introduced the concept of “mortgage holidays” to alleviate the burden on borrowers with outstanding mortgage loans following recent increases in interest rates by Narodowy Bank Polski; (2) a Portuguese law on a measure to temporarily reduce the benchmark Euribor rates by 30% for variable rate mortgage loans, which aims at mitigating the effects of rising interest rates on the residential mortgage market and provide greater predictability for families with variable rate mortgages; (3) a Romanian law on certain fiscal-budgetary measures to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of Romania, which concerns, among other things, the imposition of a turnover tax on credit institutions that are Romanian legal entities or Romanian branches of foreign legal entities; (4) a Slovak law on a special levy on business in regulated industries by (a) extending the scope of the regulated persons that are subject to a special levy to include credit institutions doing business in Slovakia, and (b) imposing a specific levy rate on these credit institutions; and (5) a Latvian law amending the Consumer Protection Law, which provides that during the year 2024 credit institutions will be under an obligation to pay a mortgage borrower protection fee for the benefit of borrowers who fulfil certain conditions. These cases were considered to be clear and important because the laws raise financial stability, prudential supervisory and, in the Latvian, Portuguese and Slovak cases, also monetary policy considerations.
The final national non-compliance case is a Spanish case concerning a law requiring the Banco de España to take the necessary measures to make it possible for investment firms to open accounts with the central bank in order to deposit the funds they receive from their customers. This case was considered to be clear and important because, apart from its direct impact on the operation of payment systems, it might raise issues relating to monetary policy and financial stability.
The ECB adopted 12 opinions on EU legislative proposals, covering topics such as a digital euro; the legal tender of euro banknotes and coins; the reform of economic governance in the Union; the Union’s crisis management and deposit insurance framework; measures to mitigate excessive exposures to third-country central counterparties (CCPs), improve the efficiency of Union clearing markets, and address the treatment of concentration risk towards CCPs and counterparty risk on centrally cleared derivative transactions; instant credit transfers in euro; climate-related matters, including the energy performance of buildings, corporate sustainability due diligence, and the transparency and integrity of environmental, social and governance rating activities; European Union labour market statistics on businesses; and the appointment of a new member of the ECB’s Executive Board.
With regard to opinions on national legislation, which often cover more than one subject, the ECB adopted 19 opinions concerning NCBs; 15 opinions concerning the stability of the financial system; 13 opinions concerning the prudential supervision of credit institutions; seven opinions concerning currency matters and means of payment; five opinions concerning monetary policy instruments and operations and the implementation of monetary policy; and three opinions concerning payment and/or securities settlement systems. The topic of special purpose bank tax and levies introduced in response to increased inflation and interest rates was the subject of seven opinions in the course of 2023.
9.3 Compliance with the prohibition of monetary financing and privileged access
Pursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the compliance of the EU national central banks (NCBs) with the prohibitions laid down in Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty and Council Regulations (EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 123 prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from providing overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility to governments and EU institutions or bodies, as well as from purchasing in the primary market debt instruments issued by these institutions. Article 124 prohibits any measure, not based on prudential considerations, which establishes privileged access by governments and EU institutions or bodies to financial institutions. In parallel with the Governing Council of the ECB, the European Commission monitors Member States’ compliance with the above provisions.
The ECB also monitors the EU central banks’ secondary market purchases of debt instruments issued by the domestic public sector, the public sector of other Member States and EU institutions and bodies. According to the recitals of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the acquisition of public sector debt instruments in the secondary market must not be used to circumvent the objective of Article 123 of the Treaty.
The ECB’s monitoring exercise conducted for 2023 confirmed that Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty were in general respected.
The ECB will continue monitoring the involvement of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in the Budapest Stock Exchange as the purchase of the majority ownership of the Budapest Stock Exchange by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in 2015 may still be seen as giving rise to monetary financing concerns.
The Central Bank of Ireland’s final disposal of assets related to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation during 2023 through sales of long-duration floating rate notes has brought to an end the serious monetary financing concerns that had persisted since 2013.
The financing by NCBs of obligations falling upon the public sector vis-à-vis the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is not considered as monetary financing provided it results in foreign claims that have all characteristics of reserve assets. However, financial donations as provided in previous years by the Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique and Banque de France via the IMF for debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries did not result in any foreign claims and therefore require corrective measures.
The ECB continued to interact closely with its European and international counterparts in 2023. The connection between the ECB and the European Parliament is an essential part of the ECB’s accountability framework. The ECB engaged in regular hearings and correspondence with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament (ECON). Additionally, the ECB interacted withECON as part of its ongoing work on a digital euro. At international level, the ECB engaged constructively in dialogue with its G20 partners. It supported, among other things, the Indian Presidency’s initiatives on financial sector regulation, cross-border payments and crypto-assets.The ECB also continued to engage in central bank-relevant discussions on various issues related to the functioning of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including the review of IMF quotas, adjustments to the IMF’s lending policies and toolkit, and matters surrounding Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and their channelling.
10.1 The ECB’s accountability
The ECB was granted independence under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Being independent means that the ECB can take decisions in pursuit of its primary goal of maintaining price stability immune from political influence. However, accountability is an essential counterpart to this independence. The ECB is accountable for its actions to the European Parliament, which represents EU citizens. Fulfilling these accountability obligations is a crucial part of the ECB’s responsibilities. The two-way dialogue between the ECB and the European Parliament allows the ECB to explain its actions and policies to the representatives of EU citizens and to listen to their concerns. Over time this dialogue has evolved beyond the requirements set out in Article 284(3) of the TFEU. To promote continued common understanding and effective cooperation, in June 2023 the President of the ECB and the President of the European Parliament signed anexchange of letters clarifying the accountability arrangementsbetween the ECB and the European Parliament in the area of central banking.
In 2023 the President of the ECB took part in four regular hearings of the ECON Committee and engaged in theplenary debate on the ECB’s 2021 Annual Reportin February, following which the European Parliament issued a resolution. In May the Vice-President then presented the ECB’s 2022 Annual Report to the ECON Committee. On the same day, the ECB released itsfeedback on the input received from the European Parliamentas part of its resolution on the 2021 Annual Report. Additionally, in May the ECB hosted the annual visit to the ECB by a delegation of Members of the ECON Committee. In addition, the ECB responded to 27written questions from Members of European Parliamentin the course of the year.
Furthermore, the ECB interacted closely with the ECON Committee in the context of its work on a digital euro. In 2023 the then Executive Board Member Mr Panetta participated in three ad hoc hearings of the ECON Committee to discuss progress made during the digital euro investigation phase, including the topics of user experience, legal tender, and the digital euro legislative process.[78]The ECB also organised staff-level technical seminars with the European Parliament and participated in events organised by Members of the European Parliament to discuss a digital euro.
According to thelatest Eurobarometer surveyconducted in October and November 2023, 79% of euro area respondents support the euro and 43% tend to trust the ECB. The high level of support for the euro is a very positive sign, while the relatively lower level of trust in the ECB shows that the institution needs to continue its efforts to communicate with the public and citizens’ elected representatives. Building public trust will also remain integral for the ECB going forward. As such, the ECB remains committed to actively participating in constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and citizens in the euro area.
10.2 International relations
The global economy during India’s G20 Presidency in 2023 continued to be negatively affected by Russia’s war against Ukraine and, in the last quarter, increased uncertainty owing to the conflict in the Middle East. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors were confronted with lower global growth, high inflationary pressures and volatile energy prices. While disagreements among members on geopolitical issues prevented the adoption of communiques at the February and July 2023 meetings, the joint G20 Leader’s Declaration in New Delhi, as well as the decision to admit the African Union as a future permanent member to the G20, highlighted the membership’s efforts to preserve the forum’s effectiveness and inclusiveness. The ECB welcomed and supported the Indian Presidency’s initiatives to improve the regulatory framework in the banking and non-banking sectors, facilitate cross-border payments and reach agreement on a G20 roadmap to contain the risks from crypto-asset ecosystems. The ECB also supported the G20’s efforts to scale up sustainable finance from private and public sources for the global transition towards Net Zero. In view of the digital euro project, the G20 discussions on the design choices and safeguards for central bank digital currencies were also a high priority from the ECB’s perspective.
The ECB continued to play an active role in discussions about the international monetary and financial system at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in other fora, promoting the central bank perspective in common European positions taken in these fora.[79]In 2023 key topics included the review of IMF quotas, adjustments to the IMF’s lending policies and toolkit, and matters surrounding Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and their channelling.
On 15 December 2023 the IMF Board of Governors concluded the16th General Review of Quotasand approved an increase of members’ quotas by 50%, which will bring total IMF quotas to SDR 715.7 billion.[80]The quota increase will be allocated to members in proportion to their existing quota shares. Adjustments to the IMF toolkit were introduced, which also enabled the Fund’s continued support for Ukraine.[81]A 48-month arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility for Ukraine was approved at the end of March 2023.[82]The IMF also further strengthened the preventive role and flexibility of its toolkit by concluding thereview of precautionary instrumentsin October 2023. At the end of 2023 IMF lending remained close to its highest historical levels: the total General Resources Account credit outstanding stood at around SDR 92 billion, with the exposure to the Fund’s largest borrower accounting for one-third of this amount.
In a follow up to the allocation of USD 650 billion of SDRs in 2021 to meet a long-term global need to supplement existing reserves, which also helped countries to deal with the pandemic, efforts to channel SDRs or equivalent resources to further help emerging market economies and low-income countries reached a milestone in June 2023, when the global ambition to mobilise USD 100 billion was met. EU Member States made a major contribution to this effort, accounting for over 31% of commitments. The bulk of the global target is destined for the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. The ECB also continued to support international initiatives to help vulnerable countries tackle rising debt vulnerabilities, in particular implementation of the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments.
The ECB carries out key work on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. For a public institution like the ECB, this includes its accountability vis-à-vis European Union (EU) citizens and their elected representatives, communicating and engaging with different audiences, adhering to the highest ethical standards and transparency, empowering employees and promoting their well-being, as well as looking at climate and environmental impacts and risks.
11.1 Updates on environmental, social and governance matters
This overview of key ESG developments in 2023 is complemented by other sections of this annual report and additional information available on the ECB’s website (Table 11.1).
Sections 11.2 and 11.3 outline how, as a European institution, the ECB worked towards continuously strengthening its governance frameworks as well as fostering transparency and closeness to citizens in 2023. Section 11.2 outlines the ECB’s efforts to strengthen European and international cooperation in the areas of ethics, integrity and good conduct, thereby also responding to increased public interest in this area.[90]Section 11.3 describes the concerted efforts by the ECB to clearly explain its policies during a period of high inflation, targeting different audiences and addressing people’s concerns about the future of our currency. Section 11.4 lists key developments in 2023 that affected the ECB’s human resources management and provides updates on the appointment of a diversity and inclusion officer and a mediator. Lastly, Section 11.5 covers the ECB’s work on climate-related and environmental topics and provides details on more specialised publications in this area.
The ECB tackles ESG risks as part of its risk management frameworks for financial and non-financial risks, as described in the chapter on risk management in theECB’s Annual Accounts 2023.
Climate stress testing started in 2022 and has since become a regular exercise. It forms part of the action to progressively integrate climate-related risks into the overall risk framework. In itsfirst climate risk stress test of the Eurosystem balance sheet, the ECB assessed the sensitivity of the Eurosystem’s financial risk profile to climate change and in doing so enhanced the Eurosystem’s climate risk assessment capabilities. The results provided a first estimate of the impact of climate risk on the ECB’s balance sheet.
11.2 Strengthening ethics and integrity
The ECB’s Compliance and Governance Office (CGO) is entrusted with setting the appropriate rules on ethics and governance, and monitoring compliance with these. In 2023 new initiatives focused on providing an enhanced training experience to staff, ranging from introductory courses and e-learning programmes for newcomers, to refresher courses for longer-serving staff and tailormade training to address the needs of specific business functions. Various outreach projects were also organised over a period of six to eight weeks around Global Ethics Day, with a view to both drawing ECB staff’s attention to the need to comply with the ethics rules and informing the public of the ECB’s focus on these matters.The CGO continued to upgrade and streamline its processes, facilitate staff access to ethics advice and comply with the ECB’s ethics standards.
Increased awareness in the areas of ethics and integrity and easy access to ethical advice led to a pronounced increase in requests from 1,690 in 2022 to 2,767 in 2023 (Chart 11.1).
The compliance checks, which were conducted with the support of an external audit firm, confirmed the overall adherence of ECB staff members and the ECB members of high-level bodies to the rules on private financial transactions.
The ECB’s independent Ethics Committee complements the ECB’s governance structure. It providesadvice to high-level ECB officials on questions of ethics, mostly concerning private activities and post-mandate gainful employment, and assesses theirdeclarations of interests. In addition, the Ethics Committee monitors European and international developments in the field of ethics and good conduct. It also advises on desirable updates of the ECB’s ethics framework for high-level ECB officials, such as the recent enhancement of the rules on private financial transactions.
The Ethics and Compliance Committee continued to provide support to the national central banks and national competent authorities on the implementation of theEthics Guidelines adopted in 2021, as well as guidance on a coherent and consistent interpretation of ethics standards across the Eurosystem. In addition, to best leverage and benefit from a diversity of views, the Committee organised sessions on topics of mutual interest, which were attended by over 50 different public institutions and organisations.
At the European level, in 2023 the ECB continued to play an active role in the ongoing interinstitutional negotiations on the establishment of an independent EU ethics body.
At international level, the ECB was closely involved in knowledge-sharing and standard-setting in theEthics Network of Multilateral Organizations, in both its role as Vice-Chair of the network and through its contributions to meetings and the annual conference. The ECB also contributed to the firstreview of the EU’s implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.
11.3 Communication and transparency of ECB policy
Falling, but still much too high, inflation and the increasingly tangible effects of the ECB policy tightening on the economy created a challenging communications environment for the ECB in 2023. In times of exceptional uncertainty and a cost-of-living crisis, the focus of ECB communication had to be on reassuring people and businesses about its commitment to bring inflation back to target and convince them that it would be able to do so with the key policy tools at its disposal.
The ECB therefore stepped up its monetary policy communication. As monetary policy tightening started to produce its intended effect of dampening demand, it was important to explain the ECB’s decisions, and re-emphasise that its primary mandate is to fight inflation. Alongside multiple public speaking engagements by ECB decision-makers, several posts on The ECB Blog explained howinflation affected real incomesand theimportance of governments’ structural policiesfor tackling inflation, and provided analytical insights onrecord high labour participation levels. ECB podcastsdescribed the drivers of inflationand, through a dedicatedpodcast summer school, elaborated on the ECB’s role in keeping prices stable.
At the same time, legitimate questions about why the ECB had failed to foresee the inflation surge and why its macroeconomic projections had been off the mark required answers. The clarity and accuracy of theEurosystem projectionsare especially important to anchor expectations and bolster the credibility of ECB policy. Similarly, it was essential to explain the various sources of uncertainty andcommunicate with a sense of humilityas a means of fostering trust.
In 2023, as a consequence of past monetary policy decisions, notably large-scale asset purchases, the ECB and other central banks across the Eurosystem were confronted with losses on their balance sheets. The ECB made a special effort to explainwhere central bank profits and losses come from, for instance, via a dedicated explainer. This also allowed the ECB to place those losses in the context of many years of significant profits and to emphasise that its job is to take monetary policy decisions that further its price stability objective, and not to make profits.
Further extraordinary communications efforts in 2023 centred on the future of our currency, both in the form of cash and in a digital form.
The ECB decided that the design of the third series of euro banknotes should include a participatory process involving the wider public. To that end, Europeans across the euro area were invited to participate in anonline survey on the themes of the next banknote seriesand were given a chance to select their preferred design theme from among seven options. More than 365,000 people from across the euro area took part, and their preferences were taken on board in theGoverning Council’s decision to select “European culture” and “Rivers and birds” as themesfor future banknotes. The communication and outreach around the next series of banknotes reinforced the message that the ECB and the Eurosystem remain committed to cash.
Conveying its commitment to cash in 2023 was especially important, because the ECB is preparing for a possible introduction of a digital euro.
In October 2023 the Governing Council decided to close the investigation phase of the digital euro project and move forward to the preparation phase. That step was accompanied by a multi-pronged and multilingual communications campaign, involving a variety of communication channels and products across all euro area countries, including an officialLinkedIn page on the digital euro projectand adedicated web page on the digital euro project. The campaign focused on the benefits and importance of introducing a digital euro, privacy concerns, and the legal tender role of both cash and the new digital currency. Beyond communicating to industry stakeholders, policymakers and civil society organisations, in an innovative approach, the ECB also reached out to relevant online content creators. The aim was to encourage digital entrepreneurs active in the field of money and finance to set out the rationale for a digital euro and explain its features to their online followers and subscribers.
Overall, these combined efforts and the ensuing broad media coverage succeeded in publicising the digital euro project and building further understanding. Analysis shows that while, at first, interest in a digital euro was greatest among younger generations of Europeans, awareness and understanding have now spread across all age groups.
2023 was also the year in which theECB celebrated its 25th anniversary. On that occasion, the ECB organised an event attended by the top representatives of European Union institutions, the ECB’s host country, Germany, and other euro area countries, as well as by former ECB presidents, Jean-Claude Trichet and Mario Draghi. In addition, at the end of 2023 and start of 2024 the ECB, together with other EU institutions,jointly commemorated 25 years of the euro. These historical milestones allowed the ECB to highlight the success of the single currency, its benefits for the people of Europe as a beacon of stability around the world and a symbol of European unity.
With a view to connecting with younger people in particular, in 2023 the ECB ran the “Stability is our thing” campaign on social media. This aimed to explain in an interactive and personal way core aspects about the ECB and its work: the price stability target, the role of banking supervision and how the ECB’s decisions affect everyday life. The campaign posts were seen 166 million times and reached 43 million young people.
Public access to ECB documents is an integral component of the ECB’s transparency policy. It promotes the ECB's openness and enhances its democratic legitimacy.
In 2023 the ECB received more requests (73 requests) for access to documents compared with 2022 (63 requests). Whereasrequests continued to cover a wide range of topics, including supervisory issues or high-profile initiatives like the digital euro project, there was a marked increase in requests for access to documents on institutional and governance topics, reflecting greater public interest in such matters.
In line with the ECB’s commitment to transparency, documents released in response to requests for public access were generally made available via theECB’s Public Register of Documents.Moreover, with a view to enhancing transparency, the ECB preparedan overview of the topics covered in requests for access to documents received by the ECB since 2004.
No findings of maladministration were raised by the European Ombudsman regarding the ECB’s handling of public access requests.
The ECB’s initiatives to support transparency, openness and closeness to citizens were acknowledged through its nomination to the shortlist for theEuropean Ombudsman’s Award for Good Administration 2023for “helping EU citizens understand monetary policy in times of high inflation”.
11.4 Empowering our people to excel for Europe
In the context of the gradual return to the office from 2022 onwards, the ECB focused on policies and programmes to support work-life balance, staff development and organisational resilience. A new teleworking policy was put in place in January 2023 that supports flexibility for staff and trainees. In 2023 the new virtual learning platform, EUREKA, was made available to institutions across the European System of Central Banks and Single Supervisory Mechanism, providing even more access to learning and mobility opportunities. In line with its objective of establishing a culture of lived inclusion, the ECB appointed a mediator and an HR diversity and inclusion adviser.
Following a transition phase in 2022, a new teleworking policy took effect on 1 January 2023. Based on the overall positive experiences during the period of remote working, the new policy provides flexible teleworking options to staff. It allows all ECB staff and trainees to telework up to 110 days per year, subject to compatibility with business needs.
The ECB places value on listening to staff and conducted a pulse survey at the beginning of 2023. Survey results showed that staff remained engaged, committed and connected to the work of the ECB. However, there is still work to be done to strengthen working culture. As a follow-up to the survey, the Executive Board championed an initiative to promote an organisational culture in which employees learn to respond effectively to inappropriate behaviour. Interactive workshops were introduced to help strengthen a “speak up” culture and how we all work together.
2023 was an important year for staff mobility in the ESCB and SSM. The ECB’s new learning platform, EUREKA, offered for the first time a centralised view of learning and mobility opportunities across other institutions in the ESCB and SSM. EUREKA promotes knowledge-sharing and collaboration, and is available to ECB staff as well as all ESCB and SSM staff. Under the fifth edition of the Schuman Programme launched in 2023, 41 projects were offered as secondment opportunities, allowing staff exchanges between the ECB, national competent authorities (NCAs) and national central banks (NCBs). The ECB also continued to exchange staff members with several NCAs and European institutions, as part of a dedicated SSM swap programme. By the end of 2023 nine swaps were in place with two NCAs (Banco de España, the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority) and one agency (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority).
The ECB continued its Leadership Growth Programme to develop leadership competencies and increase leadership effectiveness. Furthermore, it organised the last seven cohorts of the Women’s Leadership Programme, a successful programme launched in 2014 aimed at achieving a higher representation of women at the ECB. Another important development opportunity was offered in the form of the Mentoring Portal, which allows staff and trainees to offer mentoring and look for mentors. By the end of 2023 it had recorded nearly 100 mentor-mentee relationships.
Further key initiatives were launched as part of the ESCB & SSM Learning & Development Strategy. NCAs and NCBs were onboarded to EUREKA, which provides access to a wide range of ESCB and SSM-wide learning and development opportunities. The flagship Central Banking & Banking Supervision Executive Education Programme was launched in October 2023. Two successful “hackathons” took place in the course of the year with participants from across the ESCB and SSM. The first hackathon took place in February on the topic of decentralised finance and a second one on climate change was held at the ECB’s premises in November.
By offering a traineeship programme, the ECB promotes European integration of young graduate students and gives them an opportunity to acquire practical experience and put into practice the knowledge they have acquired during their studies. At the same time, the ECB benefits from trainees’ knowledge of the current state of academic research as well as their enthusiasm and fresh ideas. As of 1 December 2023 the traineeship grant increased to €1,170 per month, and to €2,120 for PhD students having completed at least two years of their PhD studies for traineeship vacancies at that level. Trainees also receive accommodation benefits.
Mirroring European society and establishing a culture of lived inclusion is a long-term endeavour. To achieve this, the ECB strengthened its institutional basis by supporting its six grass roots diversity and inclusion (D&I) networks and rolling out its inclusion learning programme for staff, teams and leaders. To enable a culture based on inclusion, mutual respect and psychological safety, two new roles were created: as of 2023 the new Mediator prevents and addresses workplace frictions through assisted dialogue, and the new HR D&I Adviser applies a D&I lens to all people and culture topics.
Throughout 2023 the ECB kept gender diversity high on its agenda while embracing all facets of diversity and fostering an inclusive culture. This is reflected in EDGE Move & EDGEplus certification, the ECB’s progress on the 2020-2026 gender targets, the introduction of paid parental leave for the co-parent not giving birth, piloting of a traineeship for talent on the autism spectrum, awareness sessions and events on race and ethnicity, allyship, disability and LGBT+ inclusion.
Tapping into the best talent of Europe, the ECB joined several career fairs for underrepresented groups, for example Europe’s largest career fair for black and people of colour organised by ADAN (Afro Deutsches Akademiker Netzwerk), the Sticks & Stones careers fair for LGBTIQ+ talent and allies and the herCAREER fair for women’s career advancement. To attract applicants with disabilities, the ECB promoted its vacancies on the myAbility platform. Strengthening its female pipeline and being inclusive of different socioeconomic backgrounds, the ECB continued to offer its ECB Scholarship for Women. In addition, and in a continued show of solidarity and support, the ECB launched a scholarship for 15 Ukrainian students enrolled in a Master’s degree in Ukraine.
11.5 Advancing work on environmental and climate-related challenges
Climate change is advancing, and the longer we wait to reduce our emissions and to transition to a greener economy, the higher the costs.[91],[92]Despite the progress made, the world is still not on track to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.[93]This means that the risks related to a changing climate and from an abrupt transition are growing, with impacts on monetary policy and the stability of the financial and banking systems. It is therefore essential for the ECB to understand the implications for the economy and financial sector to deliver on its mandate.
That is why the ECB, under the coordination of theclimate change centre, continued to work on itsclimate agendain cooperation with internal stakeholders and with the Eurosystem via relevant committees and dedicated fora on climate. In 2023 the ECB continued to integrate the objectives and environmental considerations of the European Climate Law into its strategy-setting, projects and policymaking processes.
In the past year the ECB worked on itsclimate and nature plan for 2024-2025, which outlines the activities it will work on in order to achieve itsstrategic climate objectives.It also identified three focus areas for action: navigating the transition to a green economy, understanding the increased physical impact of climate change and advancing work on nature-related risks.
Concrete advances were made on multiple fronts, covering a wide range of the ECB’s tasks (Figure 11.3).
In monetary policy implementation, the ECB published the firstclimate-related financial disclosures of the Eurosystem’s corporate sector holdingsin March 2023. The carbon intensity of reinvestments decreased by more than 65% in the 12 months that followed the start of tilted reinvestments in October 2022. The Governing Councilstrengthened the tilting parameterin February, when it decided to reduce the Eurosystem’s holdings of securities. Since thediscontinuation of reinvestments under the asset purchase programmein July, tilting continues for the corporate assets in the pandemic emergency purchase programme. Thefirst review of the climate score methodologyin October 2023 concluded that the framework had achieved its intended objectives and that its main building blocks would be maintained. The decarbonisation of corporate sector portfolios is expected to continue throughout 2024 on a path that supports the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, the Eurosystem continuedpreparatory work to incorporate climate considerations into its collateral framework and enhance its risk assessment and management.
Extensive analytical work supported the task of informing policymakers, the financial sector and the public about the economic and financial impact of climate change and its implications for the ECB’s tasks.[94]In 2023 the ECB continued to assess themacroeconomic implications of climate change and mitigation policiesand, in particular, theimpact of green fiscal measures on the Eurosystem/ECB staff projections. A model-based analysis on the economic impact of carbon pricing found modest adverse effects for the economy. Findings from theSurvey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises and theBank Lending Survey indicate that euro area firms are investing in the transition, and that bank lending conditions are tighter for firms with high emissions and no credible plans to transition. On the implications for monetary policy, recent analysis explored theeffects of climate change on the monetary policy transmission mechanismand found that, while the transition increases the cost of credit and reduces lending to all firms,its contractionary effect is milder for firms with low emissions and those that commit to decarbonisation. Several research papers investigated the links between a changing climate and inflation, finding thathotter temperatures can increase food inflation, but thatdemand-side effects from hotter summers can dampen inflation in the longer run, and that theeffects are asymmetric across euro area economies(see Box 1). The ECB also advanced its understanding ofhow climate change affects potential output.
In an effort toimprove the availability of climate data,the European System of Central Banks publishedclimate change-related indicators on sustainable finance, greenhouse gas emissions and physical risk(see Section 7.2).
The ECB further developed its stress testing methodology to explore the resilience of thewider economyto different transition scenarios and the preparedness ofsupervised banksto deal with financial and economic shocks stemming from climate risk. In 2023 the ECB led the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) workstream on scenario design and analysis,which published thefourth vintage of its long-term macro-financial climate scenarios. The scenarios provide an initial, common reference for analysing climate risks to the economy and financial system. The framework acknowledges the uncertainty and limitations of climate and economic modelling, for example with regards to tipping points. In collaboration with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, the ECB developedpolicy options to reduce the climate insurance protection gap, given that only one-quarter of climate-related catastrophe losses in the EU are currently insured. The ECB also analysedclimate change risks to sovereignsthat can have a negative effect on financial stability and fiscal expenditures. The ECB and the European Systemic Risk Board published a report that gathers evidence on the most important financial stability indicators and develops amacroprudential framework for addressing climate risk. The report also suggests that heavy economic dependence on natural ecosystems could exacerbate climate-related financial stability risks.
With regard to ECB banking supervision, although the credit institutions supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism made meaningful progress in theirclimate andenvironmental-related risk management practices, a number of institutions didnot achieve the progress expected for March 2023. The ECB will continue to closely monitor banks’ progress and, if needed, take enforcement actions.[95]
Over the years the ECB has continuously improved the safety and sustainability of euro banknotes throughout the cash cycle.[96]In 2023 it published theenvironmental footprint study of euro banknotes as a payment instrument. The future euro banknotes are being developed in line with eco-design principles, meaning that environmental aspects are considered at all stages of the banknote development process (see Section 6.2).
Since 2021 ECB staff members have contributed to training courses and multilateral technical workshops with central banking peers and stakeholders outside the European Union. It also participated in numerous working groups and events with central banks and other institutions and fora to advance the climate agenda and profit from regular exchanges. These include the NGFS, the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, theEuropean Supervisory Authoritiesand the European Systemic Risk Board, the Bank for International Settlements, the G7, G20 and the International Monetary Fund.
Innovative researchon nature-related risks showed that degradation of ecosystems will pose challenges for companies and potentially propagate to banks, as almost 75% of corporate loans in the euro area (nearly €3.24 trillion) are issued to borrowers with a high level of dependency on ecosystem services. Additionally, theECB explored for the first time transition risks and the climate-nature nexus. Taking into account climate change and land-use change as primary drivers of biodiversity loss, the impact of euro area companies on nature is equivalent to the loss of 582 million hectares of “pristine” habitats worldwide. The research highlights the importance of integrating climate change and nature loss in risk assessment frameworks, as they are inextricably linked.
In March 2023 the ECB started publishing its annualclimate-related financial disclosures of its non-monetary policy portfoliosin addition to its annualenvironmental statement, which together give an overview of the ECB’s own operational environmental impacts and the carbon footprint of its financed emissions as well as the related targets.[97]Updated data on the ECB’s environmental performance in 2023 will be made available in the course of 2024.
On 1 June 1998 the European Central Bank started operating as the central bank for the euro area with a clear mandate to maintain price stability. The ECB’s 25th anniversary in 2023 was an opportunity to celebrate the many achievements of the institution over this period. ECB colleagues who started off at the European Monetary Institute, the precursor to the ECB, and have continued to work for the institution right through to the present day share their personal experiences below. In particular, they describe what it was like to work at a new institution with a start-up feel and how they contributed to many important milestones as the ECB immediately established its place among its peers and evolved over time.
My career pathway at the ECB has been remarkably formative. It began with a leap of faith, with a new job in a new country. I joined the ECB at its cusp, as a young Research Analyst in the still-developing Statistics Function. With just a few hundred employees, the ECB needed “all hands on deck”, so we juggled multiple roles. A typical day was diverse: I discussed requirements with policy areas, designed statistical frameworks, programmed code and drafted the occasional speech. With institutional policies still in their infancy, I was also thrilled to see my creative solutions often rapidly deployed.
As the ECB matured, avenues for professional growth opened up. I worked in several different areas within Statistics and was able to deepen my levels of expertise and seniority. Particularly memorable responsibilities included being lead for country visits to our counterpart national central banks and national competent authorities to foster relationships and advise on their reporting preparations as new members of the euro area.
I am now in the newly established Data Office, which aims to optimise institutional data management (including in areas like artificial intelligence) and reports to the Chief Data Officer. I also contribute to the Diversity and Inclusion Forum. These are transversal roles and it is satisfying to work with varied groups and to help shape and influence broader ECB policies.
There have been setbacks, for instance Brexit comes to mind, given the uncertainties it raised about working here but, ultimately, thanks to a dynamic environment, motivated colleagues and continued prospects for development, it is the triumphs that I recall the most.
I have strong memories of the build up to the ceremony to mark the inauguration of the ECB in June 1998. I was one of a small team of organisers for this major event. There was great enthusiasm and a sense of camaraderie among the team. This was in the face of all the organisational challenges that go with setting up a new institution that would quickly have to find its feet. For several years afterwards, I enjoyed helping to organise both public and staff events at the ECB as the range and scale of events continued to expand and evolve.
Fast forward to today: I now work in the Language Services Division, after taking up an internal mobility opportunity in 2016. I look after budgeting, procurement and vendor management tasks related to translation and editing, ensuring adequate cover across the 24 official languages of the European Union. These support functions play a crucial role in assisting the ECB to communicate clearly and effectively to expert and non-expert audiences. As is the case across the ECB, we continue to embed the latest technologies. For example, together with my colleagues, I am applying artificial intelligence techniques to help enhance the efficiency of our processes.
Reflecting on this long and exciting journey, I am proud to have done my part in establishing the ECB as a world-class institution that keeps prices stable and the financial system safe for around 350 million people in the euro area. I am also grateful for having been empowered to grow professionally and personally throughout my career at the ECB.
I can still picture myself as a junior officer, working in the “Changeover Committee”, which – under the auspices of Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa – oversaw the transition of markets from ten national currencies to the euro at midnight on 31 December 1998. On that day, the culmination of everything I had contributed since starting at the European Monetary Institute in mid-1995, I naively thought the work was done. I feared that I risked getting trapped in routine after years of passion. But the following decade I spent in the newly established Directorate General for European and International Relations was to prove me wrong. Thanks to the wider interest in our monetary integration, I was given the opportunity to set up innovative joint technical assistance programmes by the Eurosystem for the benefit of central banks and supervisors in the European Union neighbourhood.
Ten years later, when the ECB became host to the independent European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in the wake of the financial crisis, I had the chance to try something new. In early 2010 I was asked to be the project manager to establish the ESRB. A year later I was appointed Head of the ESRB Secretariat. Since then I have genuinely enjoyed every single day working to preserve the resilience of the financial sector in a broad institutional setting alongside the central banks and supervisors at European and national level as well as an exceptional group of colleagues from the ECB and the ESRB member institutions.
When I joined the European Monetary Institute in 1995, I was among the first hundred colleagues tasked with the preparatory work for the introduction of the euro as the single currency for Europe. In 1998 I quickly learned how the ECB works together with the national central banks. I was thrilled to help coordinate the overall testing and to see that the newly established systems worked well, whether conducting monetary policy operations, executing payments or collecting statistics across Europe.
Encouraged by the ECB’s objective to foster internal mobility, I worked in six different business areas (Payments, IT, HR, Secretariat, Statistics and Markets). This allowed me to increase my knowledge of core aspects of central banking and hone my skills in project management, people management and leadership. I felt stimulated by the exposure to diverse perspectives and thinking styles and was also able to build lasting networks and friendships across Europe.
I am inspired by the ECB’s mission and proud to have contributed to the success of change management initiatives for the benefit of Europe. One such example is the roll-out of our document and records management system, which is key to sharing and distributing information efficiently among colleagues in the national central banks and safeguarding the ECB’s institutional memory.
I am now very happy to be responsible for the Financial Operations Services Division. I like being close to the markets and enjoy the mixture of daily operations and interesting projects that involves cooperating with many different ECB business areas, central banks and external partners. Just recently, we established fiscal and paying agency services for the European Commission.
In my free time, I love reading, cooking and hiking. I am an active member of the ECB’s hiking club, which is a great opportunity to meet colleagues outside of work and to get out into nature in different parts of Europe."
173,2023-05-31,—,"Financial Stability Review, May 2023",https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/financial-stability-publications/fsr/html/ecb.fsr202305~65f8cb74d7.en.html,"
This spring saw considerable financial turbulence, with the spotlight increasingly turning on systemic risk concerns following a series of bank failures outside the euro area. While the fallout experienced by euro area banks was limited, these events have served as a powerful reminder of the importance of ensuring that banking system fundamentals are sound, in an environment where financial conditions are being tightened to tackle elevated inflation around the world.
Price stability remains as crucial as ever for durably preserving financial stability. Tighter financing conditions to forcefully address high inflation have contributed to a reappraisal of the economic outlook and to a reversal of overly-compressed asset price risk premia. As financial conditions normalise, this may expose fragilities and fault lines in the financial system. Non-bank financial intermediaries remain heavily exposed to a turning financial cycle, despite ongoing de-risking. Such turning is becoming increasingly evident in the real estate sector – in both commercial property markets, where a clear downturn is visible, and their residential counterparts, which are showing signs of correction after several years of expansion. In all of these challenges, the resilience of euro area banks has been noteworthy, but should not give way to complacency.
Recent stresses in the US and Swiss banking sectors have served as a timely reminder of just how much the preservation of financial stability depends on the shock-absorption capacity of the financial system. This is especially true for banks, which operate at the core of the system. The resilience of euro area banks is largely attributable to the strength of their capital and liquidity buffers, under stringent regulatory and supervisory oversight. Strengthening the banking union – and notably making progress on a common European deposit insurance scheme – will reinforce the ability of the euro area financial system to withstand risks going forward.
Beyond the overview of key financial stability vulnerabilities in the euro area, this issue of the Financial Stability Review (FSR) includes three special features. The first examines how interactions in market and funding liquidity can amplify stress in the financial system. The second investigates the channels through which stress in non-bank financial institutions could propagate to euro area banks. The third furthers work on identifying potential threats from climate change, with a primer on associated risks for sovereigns.
This issue of the FSR has been prepared with the involvement of the ESCB Financial Stability Committee, which assists the decision-making bodies of the ECB in the fulﬁlment of their tasks. The FSR promotes awareness of systemic risks among policymakers, the ﬁnancial industry and the public at large, with the ultimate goal of promoting financial stability.
Luis de GuindosVice-President of the European Central Bank
Euro area financial stability outlook remains fragile
Euro area financial stability vulnerabilities remain elevated in the context of unexpected stress in the banking sectors of some mature economies.The recent failures of a number of US regional banks and the takeover of a Swiss bank have invited closer scrutiny of bank exposure to long-term fixed income securities, the stability of wholesale uninsured deposit funding and latent business model challenges. While the immediate cause of bank stress was related to idiosyncratic bank fragility in non-euro area economies, the episode prompted more general concerns about bank resilience in an environment of higher interest rates. This led to tensions in the bank equity and funding markets in the euro area. These tensions were short-lived, as euro area bank fundamentals remain solid and prompt regulatory intervention has contained spillovers from other economies. Nevertheless, it is possible that these events could lead to a reassessment of the profitability and liquidity outlooks for euro area banks.
Despite some improvement seen at the turn of the year, weak macro-financial prospects continue to pose a challenge to financial and non-financial sectors alike.Macro-financial conditions have improved slightly since the publication of the previous Financial Stability Review (Chart 1, panel a), thanks to a robust post-pandemic recovery, fading global supply chain disruptions and lower energy prices. That said, the outlook remains highly uncertain, given the presence of downside risks to growth accompanied by persistent inflationary pressures. Also, near-term financial stress indicators have picked up again (Chart 1, panel b) in the context of stress in the banking sectors of some mature economies, although they remain below pandemic and war-related levels. At the same time, there are still structural vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector in the form of liquidity mismatch and leverage. High volatility and signs of lower market liquidity are rendering financial markets and the NBFI sector prone to adverse dynamics such as forced asset sales and are increasing the likelihood of credit events materialising. Such amplification effects could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected with regard to both the cost and the availability of credit, and could dampen confidence, potentially weakening the resilience of the non-financial sectors.
Financial markets and non-bank financial intermediaries remain vulnerable to disorderly adjustments
Following the rally in financial markets seen at the turn of the year, stresses in some mature economy banking sectors triggered price adjustments.Global financial markets saw an unusually robust start to 2023, driven by optimistic macroeconomic expectations predicated on the resilience of the euro area economy at the turn of the year, the faster than expected reopening of the Chinese economy and a sharp drop in energy prices. Solid corporate financial results, alongside lower volatility in interest rate markets, pushed euro area equity valuations back above historical averages (Chapter 2). The positive risk sentiment started to fade in February, following the more hawkish tone adopted by central banks globally. It reversed more abruptly in March, as unexpected stress in the US and Swiss banking sectors sent shockwaves through global financial markets.
The potential for disorderly adjustments in financial markets has risen in the context of tighter financial conditions and lower market liquidity.Renewed recession concerns in the aftermath of the banking sector stress in the United States and Switzerland have significantly lowered market-based policy rate expectations. Financial conditions have tightened as the market turmoil has led to a widening of credit risk premia in the euro area. By contrast, the fact that equity risk premia remain compressed in absolute and relative terms, especially in the United States (Chart 2, panel a), raises concerns over potential overvaluation. Equities may thus be more vulnerable to a disorderly price correction in the event of a further deterioration in the economic outlook (Chapter 2). As such, risk sentiment remains fragile and is highly sensitive to surprises as regards the outlook for inflation, growth and monetary policy in mature economies. More persistent inflationary pressures might require more significant monetary policy responses from major central banks than market participants currently expect. Among other things, a renewed surge in energy prices could also pose upside risks to inflation and could add to already-elevated volatility in interest rate markets (Chart 2, panel b). The combination of a tighter monetary policy environment and recession fears could put pressure on the valuations of riskier assets. At the same time, elevated volatility in interest rate markets has contributed to a substantial decline in market liquidity in both corporate and sovereign bond markets, leaving them more vulnerable to adverse dynamics (Chart 2, panel c andSpecial Feature A).
The non-bank financial sector has remained resilient during the recent banking sector stresses and market volatility, but liquidity and credit risks remain high.The highly volatile market conditions which followed the flare-up of banking sector stress in the United States and Switzerland resulted in funds which invest in European and US financials, as well as those exposed to riskier assets such as high-yield corporates, facing significant investor outflows after early March. At the same time, inflows into sovereign bond funds and money market funds accelerated (Chart 3, panel a), reflecting safe haven flows in an environment of elevated macro-financial uncertainty as well as higher rates offered compared with bank deposits. Shifts by investors towards safer fund types served to reduce aggregate credit risk in the sector (Section 4.2). Portfolio de-risking has also been evident on the balance sheets of insurance corporations and pension funds, as higher interest rates have reduced the incentives for the non-bank financial sector to search for yield. That said, overall exposures to credit risk remain high, exposing the non-bank financial sector to the risk of material losses should corporate sector fundamentals deteriorate substantially. In addition, non-banks’ exposure to property markets has increased markedly in recent years, rendering institutions vulnerable to ongoing property price corrections (Section 4.1andBox 2). Strong links with banks, as an important source of funding for instance, could also give rise to additional vulnerabilities in the banking sector via liquidity and credit risk spillovers (Special Feature B).
Low liquid asset holdings and potential margin calls could pose the risk of possible forced asset sales, calling for enhanced liquidity preparedness.While increasing slightly in 2022, the share of high-quality liquid assets in investment funds’ securities holdings remains relatively low (Chart 3, panel b). As such, the risk remains high that, if they were to experience any sudden liquidity needs, funds could amplify adverse market dynamics via procyclical selling behaviour and forced asset sales, thereby introducing risks to wider financial stability. It is therefore necessary to strengthen existing regulatory frameworks and address issues related to structural liquidity mismatches in funds. Past stress events, such as the turmoil in March 2020 and the UK gilt market stress in the autumn of 2022, also vividly illustrate how non-banks can amplify margin call dynamics in the wider financial system, especially when coupled with excessive leverage. This highlights the importance of enhancing liquidity preparedness in the non-bank financial sector (Box 7).
Tighter financial conditions are testing corporate, household and sovereign resilience
Sovereign vulnerabilities have remained elevated in a context of tightening financial conditions and weak macro-financial prospects.The pressures on public finances have eased in recent months, as the big drop in energy prices has reduced the need for additional energy-related fiscal support to be provided to corporates and households. But fiscal fundamentals remain fragile in some countries given their high debt levels, rising funding costs and high short-term refinancing needs (Chart 4, panel a). Vulnerabilities associated with potential abrupt shifts in market sentiment remain contained for now, as in recent years many sovereigns have locked in cheap financing at longer maturities. In addition, the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument is able to counter any unwarranted and disorderly sovereign debt market dynamics that may pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. Foreign investors can also play a stabilising role when spreads between sovereigns become elevated, as they increase their exposures towards euro area government bond markets (Box 3). That said, interest payments are expected to increase gradually going forward, as maturing public debt is rolled over at higher interest rates (Chart 4, panel b).
Euro area firms have benefited from high profits in the context of a sharp post-pandemic recovery and lower energy prices, but rising costs are weighing on prospects.Higher revenues and profit margins have both contributed significantly to upbeat corporate financial results. In fact, many firms have been able to raise their profit margins in sectors facing constrained supply and resurgent demand, contributing to higher wage demands and, by extension, upside risks to inflation. That said, not all firms have benefited equally from the recovery. Highly indebted, energy-intensive and/or pandemic-sensitive sectors have often been unable to increase profit margins (Chart 5, panel a), with some heterogeneity across countries. At the same time, euro area firms are facing challenges from higher refinancing costs (Box 1). There are also signs of corporates switching from market-based financing to bank loans (Box 6), given the faster pass-through of policy rate increases to investment grade corporate bond yields. Looking ahead, a combination of higher financing costs and highly uncertain business prospects will weigh on the corporate sector outlook (Chart 5, panel b). In particular, a sharper economic slowdown than currently anticipated, together with a disorderly tightening of financing conditions, could prove particularly challenging for those firms that exited the pandemic with higher debt levels, subdued earnings and low interest coverage ratios. Small and medium-sized enterprises may be particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic activity and higher borrowing costs, as they have benefited less from the economic recovery (Section 1.3).
In recent months, euro area households have benefited from lower energy prices and a resilient labour market, but higher interest rates are increasingly weighing on credit dynamics.Household confidence has recovered to some extent in recent months, in line with the marked drop in energy prices and the associated lower headline inflation outturns (Section 1.4). But households’ real incomes and consumption remain under pressure from persistently high inflation, especially for lower income buckets. The real income squeeze, coupled with higher interest rates, is increasingly compromising households’ debt servicing capacity, particularly in the consumer loan segment. On a positive note, resilient labour markets have so far supported incomes, and the shift towards more fixed-rate mortgage lending in recent years has shielded many households from the immediate impact of higher interest rates. The use of borrower-based macroprudential measures in most euro area countries in recent years has also helped to limit the build-up of risks. That said, vulnerabilities could resurface, should labour market conditions deteriorate or energy prices rise again.
The euro area property market cycle is turning, as higher interest rates weigh on affordability
The euro area residential real estate cycle has shifted into correction mode, compounding the vulnerabilities of euro area households.Euro area residential real estate markets cooled markedly in the second half of 2022. The easing of residential property price inflation is apparent in most euro area countries, in particular those (notably Germany) which were less affected during previous crises (Chart 6, panel a). Orderly price corrections might be warranted, as overvaluation measures have been signalling the potential for corrections in recent years. That said, looking ahead, a fall in prices could become disorderly as rising interest rates on new mortgage lending increasingly compromise affordability and increase the interest burden on existing mortgages, especially in countries where variable-rate mortgages predominate. This is also indicated by the record high number of banks– even more than during the global financial crisis – reporting a decline in the demand for mortgages in the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, euro area banks have tightened credit standards for mortgage loans considerably, against a backdrop of rising interest rates and deteriorating housing market prospects. The pace of prices falling could be further amplified in countries and regions where the presence of institutional investors is strong (Box 2).
Euro area commercial real estate (CRE) markets remain in a clear downturn.In an environment of tighter financing conditions and elevated macro-financial uncertainty, CRE valuations have continued to decline sharply. Demand has dropped significantly across both the office and the retail segments, with overall transaction volumes declining at a pace similar to that observed during the global financial crisis (Chart 6, panel b). The challenges associated with the current uncertain market environment are amplified by pandemic-induced structural changes, particularly in markets for lower quality assets where tenant demand has weakened since the pandemic (Section 1.5). While bankruptcies among CRE-exposed non-financial firms remain low, an even more pronounced adjustment in CRE markets could expose structural vulnerabilities in some open-ended property funds, increase credit risk for lenders and lower collateral values.
Euro area banks have proven resilient to bouts of bank stress in some advanced economies
Stress in the US and Swiss banking sectors has triggered concerns over the health of parts of the banking industry, although the impact has been limited in the euro area amid solid bank fundamentals.The bullish market sentiment towards euro area banks that prevailed after the publication of the previous Financial Stability Review reversed abruptly in the first half of March (Chart 7, panel a). The failure of three medium-sized banks in the United States – Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and later First Republic – as well as the takeover of Credit Suisse in Switzerland, led to broader market concerns over banks’ exposure to long-term fixed income securities, the cost and stability of deposit funding amid the growing digitalisation of banking services, business model viability and banks’ risk management practices. Euro area bank share prices fell sharply, while signs of tension became apparent in riskier bank bond markets, notably the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) segment (Chart 7, panel b), following the decision by the Swiss authorities to write down Credit Suisse Group’s AT1 instruments before its equity capital had been used up. However, given the idiosyncratic nature of the sources of US and Swiss bank stress, tensions have remained contained, and the broader implications for euro area banks have been limited. The resilience of the euro area banking sector has, in aggregate, been underpinned by strong capital and liquidity positions, and by greatly improved asset quality and profitability in recent years (Chart 7, panel c).
Bank operating profitability improved further in 2022, but the outlook has become more uncertain amid vulnerabilities in non-financial sectors.Supported by higher interest rates and low loan loss provisions, euro area banks showed robust earnings momentum throughout 2022. This is particularly true for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates. While the profitability of most euro area banks has benefited from rising interest margins, uncertainties have increased around the profitability outlook. In fact, the net interest income benefits from higher interest rates could turn out to be smaller than expected, given lower interest rate expectations more recently and a catch-up in deposit rates. Also, an environment of more muted economic growth prospects, coupled with considerably tighter credit standards and a slump in credit demand, may weigh on volume growth going forward. Furthermore, some signs of increasing credit risk are already becoming evident in loan portfolios that are more sensitive to cyclical downturns, such as those with exposures to commercial real estate, SMEs and consumer loans (Section 3.4). As a result, banks may face the risk of higher provisioning costs (which tend to increase markedly around credit events), with better-capitalised banks tending to provision significantly more than banks with less capital headroom (Box 5).
The prospects of higher bank funding costs are increasing downside risks to euro area bank earnings, while a stable deposit base is limiting funding risks.Bank bond funding costs have risen markedly since the start of 2022 on account of higher interest rates and, more recently, heightened market concerns regarding banks. As such, rolling over maturing bonds will increase banks’ market funding costs going forward. Banks could also face upward pressure on their funding costs if competition for deposits were to rise and translate into faster deposit repricing (Box 4). In particular, in countries where fixed-rate loans predominate, higher funding costs make it more challenging for banks to fund low-yielding assets until maturity. That said, standard regulatory metrics suggest strong liquidity resilience overall, despite a recent decline in the funding liquidity of banks (Special Feature A). Unrealised mark-to-market losses on bond holdings are limited (Chart 8, panel a), given the relatively low share of bond holdings in total assets, and are fully reflected in regulatory liquidity ratios. Securities held at amortised cost can be used to obtain secured funding, including through ECB operations, without crystallising the valuation losses. Banks’ vulnerability to liquidity shocks is further mitigated by composition of high-quality liquid assets, which consist largely of reserves held with the ECB. In aggregate, euro area banks do not share the funding vulnerabilities which have contributed to recent US and Swiss bank failures. They are funded mainly by deposits, with retail customers providing the majority of all deposits. In addition, a relatively high share of deposits is covered by deposit guarantee schemes (Chapter 3.1).
A greater need to respond to cyber and climate risks, and strong interlinkages with the NBFI sector, may also challenge euro area banks.Next to the cyclical headwinds associated with the challenging macro-financial conditions, euro area banks need to press ahead with digital transformation, not least so they can respond to the growing threat of cyber risks (Section 3.3). They also need to manage the implications of the transition to a greener economy. The results of the second ECB top-down economy-wide climate stress test suggest that, while the overall impact of the green transition is limited relative to portfolio size, it increases banks’ expected losses and provision needs in the short term (Box AinSpecial Feature C). In addition, elevated vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector may produce spillover risks for euro area banks, given the strong interconnections, exposing such banks to liquidity, asset price and credit risks (Special Feature B). These links appear on both sides of banks’ balance sheets and are stronger for larger banks (Chart 8, panel b).
Completion of the banking union would further enhance the resilience of the financial system
All in all, the financial stability outlook remains fragile, with stresses in the United States and Switzerland bringing banking sector vulnerabilities back into focus in an uncertain macro-financial environment.Pre-existing vulnerabilities could become more prominent and risks could spread across different sectors, should further pockets of vulnerability be revealed in the US or other banking sectors and/or macro-financial conditions worsen. The materialisation of downside risks to economic growth, more persistent inflation or a disorderly tightening of financial conditions could expose existing vulnerabilities, notably those associated with high levels of debt across the economy as well as the potential for disorderly adjustments in both financial and tangible asset markets. At the same time, shocks such as the failure to reach a political agreement on the US government debt ceiling or a further escalation of geopolitical tensions could cause these vulnerabilities to materialise, possibly simultaneously.
Preserving financial sector resilience remains key as the financial cycle turns.In the light of elevated uncertainty, involving accumulated vulnerabilities and signs of a turning financial cycle, macroprudential policy should continue to focus on ensuring that the financial system remains able to withstand adverse shocks. Existing macroprudential capital buffers should therefore be maintained to preserve the resilience of the banking sector, as the conditions for their release have not yet been met. Targeted increases in capital buffer requirements may still be considered in some countries. For example, in countries with a framework that features a positive neutral rate for the countercyclical capital buffer, the build-up of the buffer towards the neutral rate is welcome, provided that procyclical effects are avoided. Banks should, in the context of increased downside risks to economic growth and recent banking sector stresses, refrain from increasing payout ratios further, but should instead focus on preserving their existing substantial resilience. Finally, borrower-based measures under the remit of national authorities should continue to ensure sound lending standards and the sustainability of household debt, in a framework where capital-based and borrower-based measures complement each other.
The sources of US and Swiss banking sector stress have highlighted the need to complete the banking union and to further strengthen the EU bank regulatory framework.The recent banking sector stress has highlighted the need for sound corporate governance and effective risk control by banks. At the same time, it has also been a powerful reminder of the need to complete the banking union (Section 5.1), in particular the crisis management framework and a common European deposit insurance scheme. In addition, full implementation of the final Basel III elements by the agreed deadline of January 2025 is essential to ensure that banks remain well-capitalised, in order to foster trust in the EU banking system and to provide additional levers for supervisory scrutiny. ECB Banking Supervision, the Single Resolution Board and the European Banking Authority have recently reiterated the need for the consistent application of the EU’s detailed order according to which shareholders and creditors of a troubled bank should bear losses applied in past cases. This will also guide the actions of the Single Resolution Board and ECB Banking Supervision in any possible crisis interventions going forward.
Structural vulnerabilities in different parts of the non-bank financial sector require a comprehensive policy response across entities and activities.In the light of persisting vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector and the risk of renewed stress, it is critical that policy initiatives continue to be pursued as a matter of priority. The focus should be on policies that reduce liquidity mismatch in investment funds, tackle risks arising from financial and synthetic leverage across the NBFI sector and enhance liquidity preparedness across a broad range of institutions, especially in relation to margin calls. As it will take time for regulatory reforms to be agreed internationally and then implemented, the authorities regulating and supervising NBFI entities should pay close attention to vulnerabilities in the sector and should play an active role in strengthening resilience, in accordance with their mandates and existing policy frameworks (Section 5.2).
1.1 An improved but still fragile economic outlook
Amid high uncertainty, private sector forecasters have upgraded their baseline growth expectations for the euro area in the light of moderating energy prices.The global economic outlook seems fragile, after a period of high macro volatility, as geopolitical tensions remain high and financial conditions are tightening. At the same time, forecasters have revised euro area growth expectations for 2023 up to 0.6%, in contrast to expectations of a shallow recession of -0.1% as recently as November last year, in response to falling energy prices, China’s reopening helping to ease strains on global supply chains and labour markets remaining tight. In parallel, consensus inflation expectations for 2023 remain high (5.6% as against 5.8% in November 2022). Despite the improvement in growth prospects, risks to the outlook for economic growth remain elevated, as the distribution of expected GDP outcomes for the euro area economy in 2023 remains tilted to the downside (Chart 1.1, panel a) and inflation expectations remain high (Chart 1.1, panel b). Against the background of the stress events in the banking sector, risks to the outlook are driven predominantly by the potential for a disorderly tightening of financial conditions combined with heightened geopolitical risks.
Easing energy prices have helped headline inflation to moderate, but risks to energy prices and inflation remain tilted to the upside.Despite a normalisation of energy prices, underlying global price inflation remains elevated and upside risks to commodity prices remain high. Tight and resilient labour markets have contributed to persistent core inflationary pressures. Moreover, measures of core inflation have continued to surprise to the upside, as the pass-through of higher costs to the services, food and industrial goods sectors is still ongoing and is likely incomplete. High geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with efforts to secure natural gas supply for the next winter season (Chapter 2) and a stronger than expected economic rebound in China, could push energy prices higher again.[1]
The global growth outlook could be derailed if there is a disorderly tightening of financial conditions while inflation remains at high levels.To ensure the timely return of inflation to their medium-term targets, central banks around the world have continued to raise their policy rates, thereby contributing to a global tightening of financial conditions. Consequently, the market pricing of the terminal rate globally, and in the euro area, has increased (Chart 1.2, panel a). Adding to tighter conditions, the recent failures of a number of US regional banks and the takeover of a Swiss bank have pushed up risk premia, including in the euro area (Chart 1.2, panel b). Moreover, changes in monetary policy expectations have resulted in the euro appreciating against a bucket of major currencies, further contributing to tighter financial conditions. Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten credit conditions more strongly than expected, with feedback to the broader economy, as they might impact credit availability and increase debt service costs further.
Globally, the failure to raise the US debt ceiling, possible side effects of China’s reopening and vulnerabilities in emerging markets are adding to downside risk and heightened uncertainty.Against the background of high political uncertainty, the inability to raise the US debt ceiling debate could spark financial market volatility and hit US growth prospects. A disorderly process could add to the risks of US sovereign debt being downgraded (Chapter 2).[2]Moreover, the reopening of the Chinese economy after pandemic lockdowns is having an ambiguous impact on global inflation levels and is adding further to uncertainty. On the one hand, it could exert upward pressure on commodity prices and global inflation levels as pent-up demand boosts consumer expenditure. On the other hand, the reopening is helping to ease supply bottlenecks.[3]Moreover, risks in China’s property market remain high, even though some improvement in conditions has been observed since the start of the year. Finally, a prudent policy stance in emerging markets is currently helping to mitigate spillovers from higher interest rates in developed economies and has kept vulnerabilities contained.[4]However, a further – or disorderly – tightening of financial conditions could leave some emerging market economies vulnerable to capital outflows and might challenge their ability to service foreign currency debt.
Against the background of high uncertainty, the risks to financial stability stemming from materialising vulnerabilities remain elevated.The drop in energy prices has relieved some pressure on inflation and has contributed to an improvement in the growth outlook. However, inflation remains high and the outlook for economic growth remains weak, with risks skewed to the downside. Moreover, after an episode of high macro volatility, global economies face renewed uncertainty from the potential financial feedback to credit availability resulting from the recent stress events in the banking sectors of some mature economies.
1.2 Fiscal positions benefit from lower energy prices, while unaddressed challenges lie ahead
The euro area fiscal deficit is expected to decline, as lower energy prices help the fiscal outlook.The projected euro area budget deficit is expected to decline somewhat in 2023 (to 3.4% of GDP) and more significantly in 2024 (to 2.4% of GDP), before remaining unchanged in 2025 (Chart 1.3, panel a). The forecast for the euro area fiscal position is driven by the expected improvement in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, followed by an improvement in the cyclical component, while interest payments are expected to gradually increase as maturing public debt is rolled over at higher interest rates. There are significant downside risks to this outlook, however, as fiscal positions ultimately depend on inflation developments and economic uncertainty going forward. Consequently, the improvement in fiscal positions since the previous version of the Financial Stability Review will be susceptible to substantial downward revisions if risks materialise in the form of higher energy prices (Chapter 2), Next Generation EU (NGEU) absorption rates are lower than expected or the inflation outlook deteriorates significantly.
Fiscal support measures to cushion the energy price shock remain largely untargeted.Since the end of 2022, favourable energy price and inflation developments have contributed to a slight downward rescaling of fiscal support measures to about 1.8% of GDP from over 1.9% of GDP at the end of 2022.[5]At the same time, fiscal support has been revised up for some euro area countries since the previous issue of the Financial Stability Review, following the extension of measures into 2023 or updated estimates based on final budget laws. While these support measures are helping to cushion the impact of high inflation in the short term, the effect is expected to reverse in the years after 2023. Additionally, most fiscal support measures remain untargeted and are at odds with the monetary policy response to fight inflation (Chart 1.3, panel b).[6]Broad-based fiscal stimulus to aggregate demand is unwarranted and economically inefficient; this should preferably be replaced by policies that target only vulnerable cohorts of corporates and households.
A favourable snowball effect, amid high inflation, has initially helped to push government debt-to-GDP ratios onto a declining trajectory.In a baseline scenario, the euro area debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from 89.4% of GDP in 2023 to slightly below 87% in 2025. Nevertheless, the ratio is projected to remain above pre-pandemic levels (84%) through 2025. The expected decline is driven mainly by a favourable interest rate-growth differential (the snowball effect) stemming from high nominal GDP growth, which should more than offset foreseen refinancing needs arising from persisting, albeit decreasing, primary deficits.[7]Additionally, sovereign debt ratios have benefited from a declining real debt burden owing to first-round effects (a favourable denominator effect).[8]
In the longer term, euro area public finances would likely be negatively affected by persistently high inflation.High inflation would have an adverse impact on fiscal positions through rising interest rates that would gradually propagate to interest payments. Additionally, the detrimental impact of the energy price shock on real economic activity will have a negative effect on fiscal positions. The size of this negative effect can primarily be explained by the nature and size of the inflation shock in the euro area – mainly a large, external shock that negatively affects household balance sheets, corporate profitability and growth, and puts high pressure on nominal public spending.[9]
Although sovereign debt service risks have been kept in check by benign debt service conditions, they might become more challenging in the future.At present, several factors are helping debt serviceability in the short term. First, the lengthening maturity of the outstanding debt stock means that principal repayment needs are about 15% lower than they would have been for running the same amount of debt against the maturity profile in 2010. Second, although yields have been increasing, the average interest paid on outstanding government debt is still hovering around record lows for most euro area sovereigns (1.7% in March 2023), and sovereigns have continued issuing longer-term debt – despite the steep increase in funding costs. Third, higher interest payments and debt issuance have not offset nominal GDP growth, a situation which has contributed to declining debt service ratios (Chart 1.4, panel a). However, debt service ratios in some euro area countries remain high, at around 40% of GDP, and rollover risks have increased as interest rate uncertainty has added to high price volatility in sovereign bond markets (Chapter 2). A further tightening of financial conditions could spark an increase in borrowing costs for more-indebted sovereigns. This means that funding conditions could become more challenging, particularly when sovereigns need to issue high volumes of debt in volatile and shallow government bond markets.
As central bank balance sheets are reduced around the world, fiscal issuance will be increasingly absorbed by the private sector.The envisaged balance sheet run-off will reduce the market footprint of the Eurosystem, thus fostering the efficient transmission of monetary policy.[10]At the same time, the higher expected net issuance of sovereign debt this year on top of the higher free float resulting from the balance sheet run-off will need to be absorbed by the private sector.[11]This could include foreign investors, which might have a stabilising impact (Box 3), and non-banks, but also encompasses domestic banking sectors. Against this background, stress in the euro area banking sector might renew concerns over the sovereign-bank nexus. So far, the co-movement in sovereign and bank credit risk has been much more contained than in previous joint stress periods (Chart 1.4, panel b).
Short-term fiscal pressures remain contained, but medium-term challenges are adding to financial stability risks.Medium and longer-term challenges are adding to sovereign vulnerabilities. Climate change is a significant source of sovereign risk (Special Feature C), and an ageing population aggravates challenges around pensions and longer-term economic growth prospects. At the current juncture, the recent stress episode in the banking sectors of some mature economies remains contained, but credit risk spillovers between sovereign and banks could lead to a reassessment of sovereign risk by market participants. The outlook for sovereigns may deteriorate if financial conditions tighten, geopolitical tensions contribute to higher commodity prices, market liquidity is low, refinancing needs are high and additional fiscal support is needed.
1.3 Corporates bank on high margins, but vulnerabilities might increase as financial conditions tighten
Euro area firms have benefited from a sharp post-pandemic recovery and strong profits, but business prospects are surrounded by high uncertainty.Aggregate corporate vulnerabilities remained below their long-run average for much of last year, with nominal gross profits surprisingly strong (19% above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of 2022). Despite the overall tightening of financial conditions, lower indebtedness and a high interest coverage ratio kept corporate vulnerabilities below their long-term average (Chart 1.5, panel a). Furthermore, both higher revenues and stronger profit margins contributed significantly to the corporate recovery in the second half of 2022 (Chart 1.5, panel b). These high profit margins are closely linked to high inflation prints in the euro area, as around half of the gross value-added deflator is explained by higher profit margins.[12]
Aggregate corporate vulnerabilities are expected to increase by less than previously anticipated, but a disorderly tightening of credit conditions is a key risk.Revisions in the forecast of the corporate vulnerability indicator since the previous edition of the Financial Stability Review mainly reflect the baseline scenario of an improving economic environment and moderating debt accumulation. At the same time, high downside risks to the economic outlook are also translating into uncertain prospects for corporates, and not all corporates have benefited equally from the economic recovery. Moreover, a disorderly tightening of financial conditions resulting from the recent stress episode in the global banking sector remains a key risk for business prospects.
Despite the overall resilience of the corporate sector, corporate fragilities vary greatly across sectors and firm sizes.Valuations of firms with higher capital expenditure needs are more sensitive to changes in interest rates (Chart 1.6, panel a). Some of these firms might also be more vulnerable to rising borrowing costs and generally have lower interest coverage ratios (Box 1). Additionally, survey-based confidence measures indicate a large dispersion across different sectors in the euro area (Chart 1.6, panel b). In general, lower business confidence has been observed in energy-intensive sectors, while sectors that have benefited more from the post-pandemic reopening demonstrate greater confidence. Moreover, soft data from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) indicate that SMEs have benefited less from the rebound in economic activity.
Tighter financing conditions have started to have an impact on firms’ debt service costs and issuance behaviour.As financial conditions have tightened, both markets and banks have reassessed the risks surrounding corporate activity. Consequently, the cost of debt has increased sharply since mid-2022 (Chart 1.7, panel a).[13]Net lending flows fell back strongly in the first months of 2023 as it became more expensive to roll over debt, indicating deleveraging in some countries and sectors. In 2022 higher interest rates and higher working capital needs on account of high production costs also contributed to a shift from long-term lending to loans with a shorter maturity. The results of the ECB’s Q1 2023 bank lending survey indicate that the rise in the general level of interest rates, together with a decline in fixed investments, served to dampen demand for new lending. Furthermore, the impact of tighter credit standards might build up over time, with a delayed pass-through to the real activity of firms. In some euro area countries, high debt service needs are accompanied by lower interest coverage ratios, and corporates might be impacted more by the rising rate environment.
At the same time, corporate balance sheets in most euro area countries are currently healthier than they were during previous rate-hiking cycles.A long period of low interest rates and a strong post-pandemic recovery have helped the average corporate to build resilience in the face of a new downturn and rapidly rising financing costs. Gross interest coverage ratios have improved, particularly for countries which started with lower levels of interest coverage in the non-financial corporate sector (Chart 1.7, panel b). Moreover, non-financial corporate debt levels declined to 144% of gross value added in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with 148% before the pandemic.
Bankruptcies in some euro area countries have started to increase from a very low base, although they remain below pre-pandemic levels.Bankruptcies in most large euro area economies remain below pre-pandemic averages, although they have now started to normalise from the low levels reached during the pandemic.[14]Moreover, forward-looking measures for default risk signal elevated risk (Chart 1.7, panel c), driven by those sectors directly impacted by the energy crisis such as transport and industry.
Corporate vulnerabilities might be higher than the aggregate suggests, as not every corporate benefited equally from the post-pandemic recovery.The uneven impact of two succeeding, and distinctly different, crises has introduced considerable diversity over the cross-section of firms and might imply that an economic recession could have more severe consequences for financial stability than this aggregate picture suggests. Furthermore, the predominance of variable-rate lending in some countries, together with high corporate debt levels by historical and international standards, renders some corporates vulnerable to a further or disorderly tightening of financial conditions. Moreover, debt instruments that are more sensitive to rate increases, such as leveraged loans, might be particularly exposed should financial conditions tighten further. As such, there could be more defaults going forward, with potential knock-on effects on bank balance sheets and household employment prospects.
1.4 A resilient household sector is facing tightening financial conditions
Euro area households have benefited from the improvement in economic conditions, despite elevated uncertainty and the impact of persistent inflation.While households remain worried about their future economic situation, consumer sentiment improved somewhat as energy prices started to decline at the end of 2022. This helped to ease upward pressure on headline inflation and make it more likely that a recession would be avoided in 2023 (Chart 1.8, panel a). Nevertheless, stubbornly high inflation continues to weigh on households’ real disposable incomes. This led to a decline in real household consumption in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Chart 1.8, panel b).
Strong labour markets have provided constant support to household resilience.The unemployment rate in the euro area remained at historic lows of around 6.6% throughout the end of 2022 and start of 2023, while the job vacancy rate reached an all-time high of over 3% (Chart 1.8, panel c). This situation benefits household incomes and suggests that a significant reduction in labour demand would be needed to cause a large increase in unemployment.
Tightening financial conditions have led to a turn in household borrowing, particularly for interest rate-sensitive items.Interest rates on household loans increased to 4% in March 2023, up by 2 percentage points year on year and marking the fastest increase since the euro was introduced. This resulted in a marked deceleration to 2.8% in the annual growth of lending to households, down by over 1.5 percentage points over the same period, driven predominantly by a contraction in demand for new mortgage loans (Section 1.5). While the annual growth in loan volumes has remained positive, net loan flows have turned negative in some euro area countries since the end of 2022, meaning that more loans were repaid than new loans were issued (Chart 1.9, panel a). As interest rates rise and banks signal their intention to continue tightening credit standards, lending volumes are likely to decline further – possibly resulting in a deleveraging of the household sector.
The debt servicing capacity of some households may be challenged by tightening financial conditions.Households in many countries continue to be shielded from immediate increases in the interest burden on their outstanding debt as a high share of loans have been issued with longer interest rate fixation periods over the last decade. This trend has reversed somewhat since the second half of 2022, particularly in countries where the relative pricing of variable-rate and fixed-rate loans has changed. Households in these countries are therefore more exposed to a repricing of outstanding debt over the short term. Some households may fall into distress as the purchasing power of their incomes continues to decline and credit standards are, as expected, tightened further. At the current juncture, households at the lower end of the income distribution are the most vulnerable as they are disproportionally affected by high inflation. Wider risks to financial stability appear contained, however, as households in some countries have experienced a significant deleveraging since the global financial crisis across the income distribution and, in particular, in the lowest income cohorts. Moreover, these households account for only a small share of overall household borrowing (Chart 1.9, panel b).[16]
While vulnerabilities among households have increased further, risks still appear moderate.Although net wealth growth has moderated significantly, aggregate household balance sheets remain resilient and may benefit from deleveraging going forward. Households’ real incomes and consumption, while under pressure from persistently elevated inflation, are supported by the continued strength of labour markets and fiscal measures. Nonetheless, some vulnerable households may face difficulties servicing their debt, as reflected in an increase in consumer loans classified by banks as suffering a significant deterioration in credit quality (Chapter 3). Such vulnerabilities could worsen, in particular if labour market conditions deteriorate or energy prices rise again significantly. Moreover, housing markets have started to cool in most euro area countries, and price developments could weigh on consumer sentiment going forward (Section 1.5). In the medium term, vulnerabilities could be exposed and debt servicing capacity could deteriorate, especially in countries where residential properties remain overvalued, debt levels are elevated and household debt is mainly at variable rates. That said, such an adverse scenario currently remains a tail risk.
1.5 Vulnerable real estate markets are turning
Both mortgage loan origination and house prices have slowed significantly amid higher interest rates.The average interest rate on loans for house purchase in the euro area stood at 3.4% in March 2023, almost 2 percentage points higher than it had been a year earlier. This steep rise in borrowing costs has led to a significant decline in loan origination. While the volume of new lending was higher during the first half of 2022 than in previous years, it declined markedly in the second half of the year and fell again sharply at the beginning of 2023 (Chart 1.10, panel a). Residential real estate (RRE) prices in some euro area countries or market segments also started declining in the second half of 2022. This fall could become more pronounced as higher interest rates reduce mortgage affordability (Chart 1.10, panel b). In the ECB’s latest bank lending survey, banks reported a further substantial net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and a strong net decline in loan demand in the first quarter of 2023. They expect credit standards for mortgages to tighten further, and net loan demand to decline further, in the second quarter of the year as well, although to a lesser extent than during the first quarter. In other words, the trends observed in new lending and house prices at the end of 2022 are expected to continue in 2023.
A combination of stretched valuations, high debt and interest rate sensitivity in some euro area countries could amplify system-wide losses should an adverse scenario materialise.The rapid growth in RRE prices over the last few years has led to stretched valuations in some euro area countries, as house price dynamics have exceeded their fundamentals. In some euro area countries, the estimates of house price overvaluation in the fourth quarter of 2022 exceed 10%, increasing the risk of a price correction. At the same time, household indebtedness has remained high, increasing the risk of defaults or lower consumption in the event of adverse shocks, such as a significant increase in unemployment. However, these vulnerabilities vary across euro area countries (Chart 1.11, panel a). In countries where fixed-rate mortgages predominate, rising interest rates will mainly have a negative impact on the demand for new loans in the short term, while they will also push up household debt burdens in countries with a large share of variable-rate mortgages.
Default rates on household mortgages are likely to rise in the event of an economic downturn, although a severe increase remains a tail risk.Simulations using loan-level data from securitised mortgage loans show that rising mortgage rates alone are unlikely to trigger a significant increase in defaults on mortgages. Estimated probabilities of default (PDs) for mortgages exhibit a moderate increase (around 0.2 percentage points) when considering only the impact of higher interest rates. By contrast, estimated PDs increase much more (by up to 5 percentage points) when considering different scenarios combining higher interest rates with higher unemployment, lower house prices and lower disposable incomes (Chart 1.11, panel b). The more severe scenarios remain a tail risk, as households have generally benefited from favourable labour market conditions and borrower-based macroprudential policy measures, and the increasing share of fixed-rate mortgages has made borrowers more resilient in many countries over recent years.
Commercial real estate (CRE) markets are suffering a clear downturn, with declining prices, falling investor demand and residual vulnerabilities persisting from the pandemic.Price growth in CRE markets fell sharply into negative territory at the end of 2022 (Chart 1.12, panel a). This was accompanied by a sharp drop in market activity, with 39% fewer transactions in euro area CRE markets in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with a year earlier. This pace of decline is similar to that observed during the global financial crisis.[17]Unlike during the pandemic, this contraction in investor demand applies across all types of CRE assets, as investors in every segment are facing rising financing costs and macro-financial uncertainty (Chart 1.12, panel b). In addition, the impact of the current market environment may be amplified by vulnerabilities arising from structural changes in CRE markets. While market intelligence indicates that vacancy rates in euro area CRE markets are substantially lower than in the United States, tenant demand in the retail and office segments has not fully recovered from the pandemic, with vacancy rate indicators remaining substantially above pre-pandemic levels (Chart 1.12, panel c). Market intelligence indicates that these structural vulnerabilities are clustered in markets for lower quality CRE assets, as hybrid working and ESG concerns are concentrating investor and tenant demand in prime markets. More widely, flows to real estate funds have been slowing steadily, raising the risk of liquidity events among euro area real estate funds, especially in those countries where open-ended real estate funds dominate (Section 4.2).[18]
The speed and depth of the turn in euro area real estate markets will determine the potential for stress on the financial system, notably so if the correction turns disorderly.Affordability and demand in housing markets have decreased as financial conditions have tightened – thus far in an orderly manner for real estate markets which had seen considerable growth in previous years. Risks remain tilted to the downside, especially in those countries where debt levels are elevated and properties might be overvalued. The commercial segment has seen a steeper downturn, as the changing macro-financial environment compounds structural vulnerabilities that arose from the pandemic. A pronounced correction in real estate markets could have an adverse effect on the wider financial system and the real economy. Stress among institutional investors, who have seen marked increases in exposures to real estate, could amplify any correction in real estate markets (Box 2), while the construction sector could suffer in the event of a pronounced decline in demand for new houses.[19]At the same time, as banks have tightened financial conditions mainly in the light of their higher risk perceptions – with funding costs or balance sheet constraints playing a smaller role – macroprudential policy measures might still allow resilience to be enhanced in the banking sector without having procyclical effects (Chapter 5).
2.1 Inflation persistence might trigger renewed market corrections
Elevated volatility in interest rate markets continues to weigh on wider financial market dynamics and may reveal both cyclical and structural vulnerabilities in the financial system.Rising inflation and market participants’ concerns that the major central banks could tighten monetary policy significantly in response were among the main drivers of the market correction seen in 2022. More recently, however, falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks have led to market expectations of a relatively rapid decline in inflation (Chart 2.1, panel a). This contributed to a decrease in implied rate volatility and, together with a stronger outlook for growth (Chapter 1), supported a substantial rebound of risky-asset valuations until early March (Chart 2.1, panel b). In contrast to 2022, the subsequent jump in volatility was related to banking sector stress in some mature economies combined with renewed recession fears. Looking forward, continued large swings in policy rate expectations may lead to a further deterioration of market liquidity conditions (Special Feature A) and may also challenge the liquidity preparedness of non-bank financial intermediaries with significant interest-rate derivative exposures (Chapter 4,Chapter 5andBox 7).
Inflation persistence could put pressure on risky-asset valuations.The stress in the banking sectors of some mature economies following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has resulted in a substantial decline in market-based interest rate expectations, especially in the United States (Chart 2.2, panel a). Growing risk aversion has led some market participants to rebalance their portfolios towards safer assets, thereby pushing risk-free rates lower. In addition, investors have concluded that the stress might result in banks further tightening credit conditions (Chapter 3), which could have a disinflationary impact and might, therefore, also be relevant for monetary policy. However, if inflation remains at elevated levels, market expectations for future interest rates might be revised upwards once again. A combination of a tighter policy environment and renewed recession fears could put pressure on risky-asset valuations. Therefore, markets remain sensitive to inflation data, albeit to a lesser extent recently, as evidenced by short-term implied volatility which increases around CPI publication dates (Chart 2.2, panel b).
A rebound in energy prices would pose upside risks to the inflation outlook and could also add to market volatility.Since Russia began to cut supplies of natural gas to the EU in 2021, futures prices for this commodity have had a strong influence on both short-term and medium-term market-based inflation expectations (Chart 2.3, panel a). Lower gas consumption, increased imports from other countries and an unusually warm winter have caused natural gas prices to fall significantly from their August 2022 peak. Although the futures curve does not suggest that prices are expected to rise greatly in the coming months, there is still a high level of uncertainty in this market. Securing natural gas supply for next winter may push prices substantially higher, given that China’s reopening will probably result in increased competition for the LNG deliveries that Europe is now more reliant on.[22]The growing upside risk to natural gas prices is reflected in the increasing skewness of option-implied volatility (Chart 2.3, panel b). Another jump in prices could lead to more persistent inflation and weaker growth, potentially precipitating renewed market corrections. Furthermore, increased volatility in commodity derivatives markets would again increase the liquidity needs of energy market participants at a time when access to funding might be challenging.[23]
2.2 Renewed recession fears could challenge risky-asset valuations
Investors are once again concerned about a potential economic slowdown.The euro area and US government bond yield curves both show a significant and persistent inversion which peaked at the beginning of March (Chart 2.4, panel a). Inverted yield curves are often interpreted as a sign of impending economic downturns.[24]Despite the yield curve inversion and generally tighter financial conditions, many other market segments reflect more optimism with regard to growth prospects. Starting last July, cyclical sectors of the European stock market outperformed defensive sectors (Chart 2.4, panel b). However, this trend reversed sharply following concerns over potential credit tightening as a result of banking sector stress in some mature economies (Chapter 3). As concerns over a possible recession rose, investors rebalanced their portfolios towards safer assets, driving government bond prices substantially higher. This was reflected in a significant decline in the correlation between equities and highly rated debt securities from elevated levels reached in 2022 (Chart 2.4, panel b).[25]
Equity market valuations may be based on overly optimistic expectations for the economy.Since October 2022, the euro area equity market has rebounded significantly on the back of declining interest rates uncertainty (Chart 2.1, panel b) and improved earnings forecasts. The improved profit outlook has been supported by the fading energy crisis and sector-specific factors such as European banks’ growing net interest income (Chapter 3). However, the extent of the market rebound may be based on overly optimistic expectations for the macroeconomic outlook. Since the market bottomed out on 29 September 2022, all euro area sectoral indices have increased by more than the corresponding change in medium-term earnings forecasts (Chart 2.5, panel a), despite higher levels of risk-free rates. Accordingly, valuation metrics for the euro area equity market, which initially declined following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have since rebounded to levels above historical averages (Chart 2.5, panel b).
The compressed risk premium in equity markets raises concerns over the potential for disorderly corrections in the event of a major economic downturn.One key equity valuation metric which raises concerns over possible overvaluation is the equity risk premium, which compressed substantially during 2022. While prices fell across many asset classes last year, equity markets remained relatively robust, as evidenced by volatility measures. This can be attributed in part to the high-inflation environment, where positive nominal earnings growth makes equities a better inflation hedge for investors than fixed income securities. However, the equity risk premium could widen substantially in the event of a significant economic contraction. In addition, the increased net supply of safe assets resulting from quantitative tightening by major central banks around the world may support higher risk-free rates and may make de-risking more attractive for investors. The crowding out of riskier assets could lead to a less orderly correction in equity and high-yield corporate bond markets (Chapter 4).
A significant economic contraction would also further increase the likelihood of credit events, potentially precipitating stress in the corporate bond market.Corporate bankruptcies picked up in some euro area countries in 2022 (Chapter 1). Although default rates on corporate bonds remain low, they are expected to rise, particularly for more indebted issuers. Spreads in the high-yield segment are still above the historical average and appear to be consistent with baseline default forecasts from credit rating agencies (Chart 2.6, panel a). However, the recent banking sector stress seen in some mature economies has increased the likelihood of more negative scenarios, which would most likely also lead to a widening of risk premia.[26]In addition, any repricing of corporate bonds could be exacerbated by current low market liquidity (Special Feature A).
Renewed recession fears might also limit issuers’ access to market funding.De-risking trends and continued outflows from investment funds focused on lower-rated issuers could limit the ability of such issuers to roll over their debt (Chapter 4). Although the funding needs of these corporates might appear limited in the near-term, given their relatively low share of high-yield debt maturing in 2023 and 2024 (Chart 2.6, panel b), the ongoing tightening of credit conditions by banks (Chapter 3) could push corporates to seek greater funding from capital markets. As the already-subdued primary market activity in the high-yield segment has deteriorated further since early March, the refinancing risk is still high for more indebted companies. In addition, individual corporates could also face impaired market access following rating downgrades, as the investment mandates of some institutional investors restrict the purchase of lower-rated securities.[27]
Vulnerabilities also persist in sovereign bond markets.Renewed recession fears coinciding with still-elevated inflation have increased interest rates volatility (Chart 2.1, panel b). Such volatility has been strongly correlated with sovereign bond spreads, with greater sensitivity for medium and lower-rated countries (Chart 2.7, panel a). Moreover, as a large share of outstanding sovereign debt was issued in a low interest rate environment, governments will face growing refinancing costs for a considerable period of time (Chapter 1). This potential increase in costs is also greater for medium and lower-rated sovereigns (Chart 2.7, panel b), making their debt more vulnerable to market sentiment going forward. However, the pace of such an adjustment is expected to be slower for those countries which have managed to substantially increase the average maturity of their debt over the last decade. In addition, the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument reduces the risk of a deterioration in financing conditions which is not warranted by country-specific fundamentals.
2.3 Global vulnerabilities might spill over to the euro area
A shift away from the low interest rate environment in Japan could test the resilience of global bond markets.[28]Inflation in Japan has been increasing over the past year, leading market participants to expect the Bank of Japan to start normalising its monetary policy. These expectations have resulted in a growing deviation between the Japanese ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate and the government bond yield capped by the policy of yield curve control (Chart 2.8, panel a). On 20 December 2022 the Bank of Japan announced an adjustment to this policy tool by widening the respective tolerance band to between around plus and minus 50 basis points.[29]As a result, the ten-year government bond yield quickly increased and the yen appreciated by around 3% against the euro and US dollar. If the Bank of Japan decides to normalise its policy, this might influence the decisions of Japanese investors who have a large footprint in global financial markets, including the euro area bond market (Chart 2.8, panel b). In particular, a rapid decline in rate differentials and increased exchange rate volatility could reduce the attractiveness of their carry trades.[30]In addition, policy normalisation could lead to wider term premia on local government bonds, which could also stimulate the repatriation of portfolio investments. Finally, valuation losses on local bond portfolios and higher risk-free rates could inhibit the investors’ risk-seeking behaviour, including their willingness to invest abroad. Japanese investors withdrawing abruptly from the euro area bond market could have a material effect on prices, particularly in more concentrated market segments. Such dynamics could be amplified by the increased net supply of these bonds resulting from quantitative tightening by the ECB.
An inability to raise the US debt ceiling in a timely manner may also lead to increased market volatility.On 19 January 2023 the United States reached the maximum amount of debt that the Department of the Treasury can issue. Since then, the government has had to rely on accumulated cash buffers or use extraordinary measures to finance its spending, including debt service. Although a technical default on outstanding debt is considered to be an extreme tail risk, a prolonged political stalemate might fuel volatility in global markets, with spillovers to the euro area. This was the case in 2011 when equity indices declined globally, despite the debt ceiling being raised before any payments were delayed (Chart 2.9, panel a). Negative sentiment was also fuelled by one rating agency downgrading the US long-term sovereign credit rating by one notch, which was linked to the debt ceiling debate. Similarities to 2011, in terms of the division of political power and the challenges for fiscal policy stemming from a higher interest rate environment, have heightened investor concerns over potential market spillovers in 2023 as well. These concerns are reflected in the rising prices of CDS contracts on debt issued by the United States, which have reached levels that are higher than those seen in 2011 (Chart 2.9, panel b)[31]. In addition, any volatility spike could be accentuated by relatively low liquidity in the US bond market.
Rapidly growing intraday leverage in the US equity market raises the risk of disorderly market moves.High levels of interest in trading S&P 500 options on the day of their expiry (commonly referred to as “0 days to expiry” or “0DTE”) resulted in the Cboe Exchange expanding the offer of these instruments. As a result, trading in S&P 500 options has soared and recently reached an all-time high (Chart 2.10, panel a), with 0DTE options accounting for between 40% and 45% of traded volumes.[32]Their short maturity makes these options much cheaper than longer-dated options. As a result, they offer extremely high leverage to investors (Chart 2.10, panel b), which magnifies their impact on the underlying stock market. Furthermore, the effective exposure stemming from these options is very sensitive to even small changes in the underlying equity index. This means that, to ensure that their own portfolios remain hedged, the sellers of these options (typically market-makers) must rapidly trade the underlying securities in line with the short-term trend. As a result, these transactions might further fuel current price momentum and volatility, creating a high degree of procyclicality. This constitutes a structural vulnerability in the event of large, abrupt swings in investor sentiment. In the current environment of high market sensitivity to macroeconomic data, negative surprises might lead to sudden and disorderly corrections in US equity markets, with spillovers potentially also affecting wider financial markets.
3.1 Compressing valuations and tighter funding conditions
After a strong start to 2023, the share prices of euro area banks declined sharply in March as volatility and default risk premia surged.Between October 2022 and the beginning of March 2023, bank share prices rose by 50%, driven by rising interest rate margins supported by higher policy rates, and an improving macro environment after China ended its zero-Covid policy. This positive sentiment partly went into reverse when two US banks – Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank – failed and Credit Suisse was acquired by UBS, a case which underscored the importance of good corporate governance and effective risk controls for business model viability (Chart 3.1, panel a, left graph). While the acquisition of Credit Suisse – a global systemically important bank – caused volatility to surge among bank stocks across advanced economies (Chart 3.1, panel a, right graph), volatility levels nevertheless remained well below those seen at the start of the pandemic. Uncertainty about the riskiness of the senior unsecured securities issued by euro area banks caused a sudden rise in their CDS spreads, with some more affected than others. The fact that expected default frequencies of euro area banks only increased slightly and that there were no downward revisions of their rating outlooks would suggest that these market dynamics were driven more by uncertainties about securities valuations and/or contagion fears, which were not accompanied by a deterioration of bank fundamentals (Chart 3.1, panel b).
High reliance on customer deposits and long-term bond funding helped to increase the resilience of the euro area banks’ funding base.The rapid rise in interest rates last year contributed to a decline in the funding liquidity of banks due to rollover, redemption and margin risks. It also exposed some fragilities, such as reliance on potentially flighty short-term funding in some financial institutions, which requires close monitoring (Special Feature A). On aggregate, however, the shares of more stable customer deposits in banks’ funding structures have increased since the global financial crisis and loan-to-deposit ratios have declined, partly in response to the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy (Chart 3.2, panel a). For the euro area on aggregate, deposits fund about 70% of banks’ liabilities. The largest providers of those funds are households followed by corporates, accounting for 47% and 25% of banks’ liabilities respectively. Stable retail deposits represent over 40% of total deposits (Chart 3.3, panel b, left graph). Market funding via bonds contributes another 15% to banks’ liabilities, with non-banks as major investors in bank debt securities (Special Feature B). Covered bonds, senior unsecured bonds and three classes of bonds eligible under the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) have broadly similar shares (Chart 3.2, panel b). The decline in excess liquidity associated with repayments of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) led to a gradual decline in banks’ liquidity coverage ratios. However, euro area banks on aggregate hold substantial liquidity buffers, mainly in the form of central bank reserves and government bonds. This availability of collateral limits the risks related to potential adverse market developments. The medium-term resilience of bank funding is reflected in their net stable funding ratios, which have declined only slightly since the end of 2021 and remain well above minimum requirements (Chart 3.2, panel c).
The pass-through of higher interest rates to depositors has been slow but deposit rates are gradually rising, weighing on overall funding costs.With the exception of some term deposits, banks have so far passed only a small fraction of the rise in policy rates through to depositors, which is reflected in low “deposit betas” (Chart 3.3, panel a, left graph andBox 4). Rising policy rates led to a surge in margins last year, helping to support bank profitability. Given the difference in rates on agreed maturity and overnight deposits, customers have started shifting some of their funds to deposit types where the remuneration offered is higher (Chart 3.3, panel a, right graph). Banks are likely to increase average deposit rates further in order to prevent outflows to competitors as customers seek higher-yielding savings products. While some deposit outflows have been observed since the beginning of this year (Chart 3.3, panel b, right graph), they tend to reflect seasonal patterns and outflows from financial customers due to portfolio adjustments towards higher-yielding instruments.
Rolling over maturing bonds will increase the market funding costs of banks over the next three years.Secondary market yields on bank bonds have risen substantially since the beginning of 2022. By 2026 rolling over senior bank bonds at current yields would nearly double the cost of bond funding (Chart 3.4, panel a) and reduce aggregate sector return on equity by around 50 basis points per year. This aggregate picture for the euro area does, however, mask sizeable differences across individual banks, as issuer ratings have a substantial impact on bond yields, in particular for unsecured bonds. Bond issuance volumes have picked up, possibly in anticipation of a further rise in interest rates and gradual TLTRO repayments. Last year bond issuance exceeded the 2015-19 average by 25%, and the first quarter of 2023 saw issuance volumes 36% higher than in the pre-pandemic years. Issuance has been particularly strong for covered bonds which, because they are secured, represent the cheapest form of bond funding but at the same time increase asset encumbrance. The cost of issuing the most junior securities has been highly volatile recently (Chart 3.4, panel b, left graph). That said, the impact of these securities on overall bank profitability is more muted than for senior bonds, even if adverse market conditions persist, as their weight in total funding is low and there is no contractual obligation to redeem these bonds. While about 65% of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds may be called by issuers within the next three years (Chart 3.4, panel b, right graph), these bonds are perpetual and banks do not have to exercise the call option if doing so would be uneconomical.
3.2 Profits boosted by higher interest rates, as banking sector faces uneven prospects
Rising interest margins helped boost the profitability of euro area banks in 2022, particularly in countries with large volumes of variable-rate lending.The aggregate return on equity (ROE) of euro area significant institutions (SIs) rose by 1 percentage point last year to 7.6%.[34]In contrast with 2021, when a reduction of loan loss provisions was the main factor behind improving profitability, the improvement in 2022 was largely driven by higher core revenues (Chart 3.5, panel a). Interest margins surged on the back of the substantial rise in policy interest rates starting in the summer of last year, while banks adjusted their deposit rates slowly. Margin expansion tended to be higher in those countries with a larger share of loans granted at variable interest rates, but other factors also played a role, such as banks’ hedging behaviour and the interest rate profile outside the banking book. In addition, lending volumes made a positive contribution to growth in net interest income (NII) in most countries during the first three quarters of last year (Chart 3.5, panel b, right graph). Conversely, NII rose less strongly in countries such as France where fixed-rate lending predominates and banks had already increased deposit rates to a larger extent. Net fee and commission income (NFCI) also increased, although at a slower rate than in 2021, while expenses continued to rise (Chart 3.5, panel b, left graph). First quarter 2023 earnings results for listed banks suggest that despite lower trading income and higher costs, profitability improved further on the back of higher NII.
Despite the banking sector stress in March of this year and slowing lending dynamics, market analysts expect euro area bank profitability to increase further in 2023.Market expectations of the future aggregate ROE of listed euro area banks for 2023 have been revised upwards sizeably since the start of this year, with ROE projections increasing from 8.1% to 9.2% between the end of last year and the beginning of March (Chart 3.6, panel a). Most of this improvement was driven by higher expected NII in an environment where interest rate projections were revised to remain higher for longer, more than offsetting the potential impact of tighter credit standards and subdued lending growth. Expectations of lower impairments represent a second important positive factor, reflecting an improvement in the euro area macroeconomic outlook since the start of this year. The compression in banks’ market valuations in March and higher bank funding costs did not appear to weigh on bank profitability as ROE expectations increased further to 10.6% at the end of May. The additional upward revisions of ROE expectations since March can be attributed mainly to higher NII, coupled with lower costs, higher NFCI and lower impairments. Bank analysts may well revise their ROE projections down going forward, given considerably tighter bank lending standards, a slump in loan demand and more muted lending dynamics for NFCs in particular as a consequence (Chart 3.6, panel b).
The strong profitability of euro area banks on aggregate masks substantial heterogeneity across individual banks, with the differences still driven by structural issues.Rising interest rates have boosted banks’ lending margins, thereby lifting profitability to levels not seen in a decade. Taking a closer look at bank profitability patterns across ROE quartiles, however, reveals lingering underlying structural issues. The ROE differential between the best and the worst performing quartiles declined until 2017, but remained persistently close to a level of 12 percentage points thereafter. In addition, a cohort of institutions in the lowest profitability quartile has found it hard to reach sustainable profitability levels (Chart 3.7, panel a). As discussed in previous issues of the Financial Stability Review, legacy asset quality problems and cost inefficiencies appear to be the two main underlying causes.[35]While the former has been largely addressed since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which is reflected to some extent in improved profitability among the weakest banks, differences in the level of cost efficiency across the profitability spectrum of banks have hardly shifted during this period. While cost efficiency improved for both the best- and the worst-performing banks between 2016 and 2022, the cost/income ratio of the weakest banks is still 22 percentage points higher than for their top-performing peers (Chart 3.7, panel b). Addressing these pockets of weak bank profitability remains key for ensuring a healthy and resilient banking sector that can continue to fulfil its credit intermediation function even in times of economic uncertainty.
3.3 Declining yet robust solvency, and rising cyber risks
The capital ratios of euro area banks declined in 2022, reflecting stronger lending and higher average riskiness of total assets.The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of euro area banks declined by around 40 basis points last year to 15%. This was mainly due to risk-weighted asset (RWA) growth, driven mostly by rising average risk weights but also, to a lesser extent, by growing total assets. The increase in RWAs stemmed mainly from robust lending growth to non-financial corporations which continued until the third quarter. In addition, the positive contribution from retained earnings, related to one-off effects from banks reclassifying share premiums to retained earnings, was more than offset by other changes in equity and higher payouts to shareholders (Chart 3.8, panel a). The decline in capital ratios is also reflected in banks’ shrinking, albeit robust, distance to their maximum distributable amount (MDA) threshold over the course of last year (Chart 3.8, panel b, left graph).
As bank profitability improved, distributions to shareholders increased and are expected to remain high in the coming years.Stronger profitability allowed average dividends and share buybacks to be increased to 1.5% of RWA in 2022 from 0.7% during the pre-pandemic period (Chart 3.8, panel b, right graph). Banking sector stresses in March 2023 have had little impact on future capital distributions. While changes in dividend futures prices since March suggest that payouts for 2024 are expected to decline by around 15%, payout expectations for this year have only been revised downwards marginally and banks have so far maintained their guidance on future share buybacks.
Incidences of cyberattacks increased further last year, above the pandemic peak, reflecting elevated threats to bank operations.The number of global cyberattacks increased by around 45% in 2022 compared with the previous year and exceeded the peak observed during the pandemic.[36]Increases in publicly disclosed cyberattacks varied greatly across regions, rising by 51% in euro area countries, 23% in the United States and 72% in other countries (Chart 3.9, panel a). The economic sectors targeted most by cyberattacks seem to be changing, with a decline evident in the share of total cyberattacks aimed at pandemic-sensitive sectors like healthcare, education, retail and IT. Conversely, it appears that core economic sectors, such as public administration, science, manufacturing and finance, are being increasingly targeted (Chart 3.9, panel b).
3.4 Asset quality concerns rise as economic outlook weakens
On aggregate, non-performing loans (NPLs) were not badly affected by worsening economic conditions in the second half of 2022.Banks’ NPL ratios for total loans and for loans to the non-financial private sector declined only marginally in the second half of 2022 (Chart 3.10, panel a, left graph). A decomposition of quarter-on-quarter changes in NPLs shows that the contribution of declines in NPL stocks slowed considerably during 2022 following the significant NPL disposals seen in 2021 (Chart 3.10, panel a, right graph). This suggests that banks’ aggregate NPL ratio may be close to reaching its trough, not least given the fact that NPL trends lag economic developments. Default rates on exposures to euro area corporates picked up in the second half of 2022, albeit remaining at low levels (Chart 3.10, panel b). At the same time, aggregate corporate vulnerabilities are expected to increase, although by less than previously expected (Chapter 1).
Early warning signs of asset quality deterioration have become more pronounced as there has been some evidence of an increase in Stage 2 loans.Stage 2 ratios for both loans to NFCs and loans to households increased in the first half of 2022 amid a worsening economic outlook. In the second half of the year, by contrast, they diverged, with the Stage 2 ratio dropping slightly for NFC loans and continuing to edge up for household loans (Chart 3.11, panel a). However, the recent improvement in the aggregate NFC Stage 2 ratio masks considerable heterogeneity at the country level, as the number of countries recording increases and declines in Stage 2 ratios for NFC loans in 2022 was roughly equal. Taking into account the reporting lag, the Stage 2 ratio for total loans appears to have moved in tandem with consensus GDP growth forecasts for 2023 (Chart 3.11, panel b), although changes in the Stage 2 ratio were relatively small, considering the weakening growth outlook. This suggests that a renewed deterioration in the growth outlook could lead to (further) increases in Stage 2 loans and higher provisioning needs.
Within the corporate sector, there are emerging concerns about the outlook for commercial real estate (CRE) loans.Despite worries about an ongoing downturn in the commercial property market (Chapter 1), growth for CRE loans accelerated to 7% in 2022, outpacing growth for total loans by around 3 percentage points. CRE loans remain a relatively small part of the loan book, however, accounting for little more than 8% of the total loans granted by significant institutions, although this share varies within a wide range across banks. The majority of this exposure is located in the euro area, while US CRE loans, where vacancy rates are substantially higher (Chapter 1), are limited to around 6% of significant institutions’ total CRE loans, or 0.5% of their total loans. Following an increase in the second quarter, the aggregate Stage 2 ratio for CRE loans dropped slightly in the last two quarters of 2022, albeit still remaining well above its pre-pandemic level (Chart 3.12, panel a).
Credit risk stemming from banks’ CRE exposures is mitigated by strong collateralisation.The share of CRE loans with higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios (above 80%) was relatively low on aggregate, at around 20% at the end of 2022 (Chart 3.12, panel b). However, these benign aggregate data hide significant cross-country heterogeneity in terms of both asset quality and collateralisation. Nearly half of all euro area countries saw Stage 2 ratios increase, while NPL ratios also rose slightly in a few countries. Some countries have a share of high-LTV loans in excess of 30%, reaching up to 53% in one case. Overall, banks’ CRE loans remain vulnerable to increasing loan losses should the rise in refinancing costs and weaker demand for commercial property lead to further property price corrections (Chapter 1). This is particularly the case for those banks with a larger share of high-LTV loans or with a higher share of lending exposures related to non-prime properties.
In the household segment, the most material signs of credit quality deterioration in the second half of 2022 were seen in consumer and other (non-mortgage) loans.Consumer loans account for only 6% of significant institutions’ total loans on aggregate, but they are typically more vulnerable to economic downturns, partly because of their low collateralisation. Some signs of worsening credit quality could already be observed during 2022. Following a gradual increase in the first three quarters of the year, the share of Stage 2 consumer loans rose more sharply in the fourth quarter amid worsening economic conditions and high inflation.[37]Stage 2 ratios for other (non-mortgage) household loans also increased significantly during 2022, whereas the rise in Stage 2 ratios for mortgage loans was more contained (Chart 3.13, panel a). At the same time, banks’ provisioning did not keep pace with the increase in underperforming loans, while the NPL provision coverage ratio also continued its downward trend (Chart 3.13, panel b). Banks’ consumer credit exposures remain vulnerable to the negative impacts of still elevated inflation and rising interest rates on households’ repayment capacity, in particular in lower income quintiles.
4.1 Despite de-risking, the NBFI sector remains vulnerable amid macroeconomic uncertainty and volatile markets
Non-bank financial institutions have continued to reduce credit risk while remaining supportive of corporate debt markets.In the context of rising interest rates, the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector has further reduced its exposure to lower-rated securities. During 2022 the sector expanded its share of AAA, AA and A-rated securities in bond portfolios, while reducing its share of high-yield assets (Chart 4.1, panel a). As a result, exposure to credit risk declined, especially in the investment fund sector, reversing the search-for-yield behaviour observed during the low interest rate environment of previous years (Section 4.2). The NBFI sector nevertheless remained active in purchasing new debt issued by non-financial corporations (NFCs). It increased both the absolute amount of higher-rated bonds purchased and its share in the total issuance across all categories of credit quality, absorbing more than 50% of newly issued NFC debt in 2022 (Chart 4.1, panel b). This highlights the importance of the sector’s role in financing the real economy, even in a challenging market environment where NFCs have increasingly turned towards bank financing (Box 6).
The NBFI sector remains vulnerable to price corrections, given macroeconomic uncertainty, volatile markets and a turning real estate cycle.Despite the recent decline, credit risk in NBFI sector portfolios continues to be elevated and may rise against a backdrop of prevailing recession risk and high inflation (Chapter 1). The sector may therefore face (revaluation) losses from rising risk premia and potential increases in the probability of firm defaults. In the event of sudden liquidity needs, forced asset sales might amplify price pressures, emphasising the importance of sufficient liquidity preparedness across the broader NBFI sector and appropriate redemption terms for funds investing in relatively illiquid assets (Chapter 5). Revaluation losses in the sector could also arise from a downturn in real estate markets (Chapter 1andBox 2). Real estate investment funds (REIFs) have grown considerably over recent years. At the end of 2022, investment funds, insurance corporations and pension funds held 8.0%, 8.1% and 6.9% respectively of their total assets in real estate and REIFs (Chart 4.2, panel a,Sections 4.2and4.3).[41]
Interconnectedness between the NBFI and banking sectors can also give rise to vulnerabilities and financial contagion risks.Investments in banks and other financial sectors can expose non-banks to spillovers from other financial entities. Given its holdings of bank-issued debt and listed shares, the NBFI sector is also an important source of funding for banks (Chart B.3, panel a inSpecial Feature BandChart 4.2, panel b). In particular, the investment fund sector holds almost all contingent convertible bonds issued by banks, even though such holdings comprise only 0.2% of total investment fund assets. The various direct and indirect interlinkages between different parts of the financial system can lead to spillovers in liquidity and credit risks, potentially serving to amplify asset price movements (Special Feature B). Pre-emptive measures, in the form of adequate liquidity buffers for instance, can both strengthen the resilience of the NBFI sector against spillovers and mitigate the risk of further financial contagion.
4.2 Investment funds remain vulnerable to liquidity risk in a challenging market environment
Amid recent elevated uncertainty and financial market volatility, investment funds exposed to relatively risky assets have faced significant investor outflows, while inflows into sovereign bond funds have accelerated.Following the banking sector stress seen in the United States and Switzerland in early March, high-yield funds have experienced significant outflows, while flows into funds focused on investment-grade corporate bonds have remained broadly unaffected. In parallel, inflows into sovereign funds have accelerated, reflecting investor de-risking (Overview, Chart 3, panel a). The banking sector stress also caused funds invested in the European financial sector to experience net outflows (Chart 4.3, panel a). Significant outflows from such investment funds may trigger sales of securities issued by banks and other financials. This could amplify the negative impact of price pressures on bank funding markets, as the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector is an important source of funding for euro area banks (Section 4.1andSpecial Feature B). In addition, money market funds (MMFs) have experienced net inflows since early March, especially in the United States (Chart 4.3, panel b). This may reflect an increase in MMF returns, with investors seeking a safe haven amid elevated macro-financial uncertainty and – in the United States – heightened concerns over uninsured deposits in the banking sector.
In recent quarters, euro area investment funds have continued to reduce their exposure to credit risk by selling high-yield securities and purchasing investment-grade bonds.Investor shifts towards comparatively safer investment funds led to an increase in funds’ overall holdings of sovereign and investment-grade corporate bonds, as well as sales of lower-rated corporate bonds, in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Chart 4.4, panel a). This has contributed to a reduction of investment funds’ exposure to credit risk. Should such de-risking continue, however, it could put pressure on high-yield bonds and make issuance more challenging.
Property funds face particular challenges in the current environment.Falling values of commercial real estate assets caused the total assets of real estate investment funds (REIFs) to decline in the fourth quarter of 2022 – for the first time since the global financial crisis (Chart 4.4, panel b). Moreover, net inflows into REIFs have been falling since the fourth quarter of 2020, with implied returns decreasing over the past two quarters. In this context, REIFs could face larger outflows in the future. Rising liquidity pressures could potentially lead to forced asset sales and amplify corrections in real estate markets (Section 4.3andBox 2), particularly in countries where REIFs have a large market footprint.[42]
Despite the recent de-risking, liquidity and credit risks in investment funds could materialise should macroeconomic conditions deteriorate and market volatility increase.The share of high-quality liquid assets held by the euro area investment fund sector remained broadly stable in 2022, but – at 13% of total holdings – remains well below the average of 17% observed between 2014 and 2020 (Overview, Chart 3, panel b). Cash holdings by equity and bond funds remain low, especially in the context of elevated financial market volatility and sizeable redemptions seen in 2022 (Chart 4.5, panel a).[43]In an adverse scenario, relatively small cash buffers could lead investment funds to engage in procyclical selling behaviour, potentially amplifying market corrections.[44]Credit risk for investment funds also remains elevated, despite declining in the past two years. Since late 2020, the investment fund sector’s shares of holdings of high-yield bonds and BBB-rated bonds have declined by 2 and 3 percentage points respectively, while holdings of higher-rated bonds have increased. Nonetheless, the combined share of BBB-rated and high-yield assets among all bond holdings was still close to 50% at the end of 2022 (Chart 4.5, panel b). Thus, in the face of recession risks and tightening financial conditions, investment funds could suffer losses associated with credit risk and asset price revaluations, especially in lower-rated segments. This could cause surges in outflows and forced asset sales. For investment funds using derivatives for hedging purposes, these effects may be amplified by asset sales to meet margin calls (Box 7). In the light of these risks, and given the relevance of investment funds as a source of funding to non-financial corporations and the banking sector, there is a need to strengthen the resilience of the sector and tackle issues related to structural liquidity mismatch (Chapter 5).
4.3 Insurers remain resilient, but rising economic uncertainty could pose challenges
Euro area insurers maintained robust profitability and solvency positions in the second half of 2022.Insurers continued to perform well in the second half of 2022, despite high inflation. Aggregate profitability – as measured by return on equity – increased rapidly (Chart 4.6, panel a), supported by strong underwriting results. Solvency Capital Requirement ratios fell marginally in the final quarter of 2022, but remain strong at over 200% on average (Chart 4.6, panel b), thanks mainly to the net positive effects of rising interest rates on life insurers’ balance sheets. At the same time, rising dispersion in the combined ratio (i.e. claim-related losses and expenses divided by premiums earned) in the second half of 2022 may point to reduced underwriting profitability for some non-life insurers (Chart 4.6, panel c).
Life and non-life insurers face different challenges stemming from rising uncertainty and inflation.Following the banking sector stress in the United States and Switzerland in mid-March, insurers’ stock prices declined sharply, driven by broader market sentiment. This is despite insurers’ limited exposures to bank bonds and equity relative to their total assets (Section 4.1, Chart 4.2, panel b). Insurers’ equity prices have largely recovered since then, except in the life insurance sector (Chart 4.7, panel a). In part, this may reflect rising economic uncertainty, as slower growth and high inflation could have negative repercussions in the life sector. Declining real household incomes could reduce future demand for new life policies, while policy lapses could become more widespread.[45]In addition, early redemptions of traditional savings products by policyholders could also weigh on life insurers’ profitability. In particular, the potential for early redemptions may increase as interest rates rise, given that policyholders may seek to reinvest in new contracts offering higher returns.
Non-life insurers are particularly exposed to claims inflation.[46]As is the case with life insurers, slower economic growth could pose a challenge to non-life (re)insurers through falling demand for new policies and increasing numbers of policy lapses. In addition, non-life insurers are exposed to claims inflation (i.e. increases in the nominal value of claims), which may weigh on their profitability. This is particularly the case where they face difficulties in raising prices to keep pace with inflation. A significant rise in the nominal value of claims would increase non-life insurers’ claims ratios (i.e. the ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned) which could, in turn, push their combined ratios (i.e. claim-related losses and expenses divided by premiums earned) above the threshold required for profitable underwriting (Chart 4.7, panel b).
The resilience of insurers and pension funds may benefit from rising interest rates in the medium term.Gradually rising interest rates generally have a positive impact on the capital positions of life insurers. This effect tends to be more material for insurers with larger negative duration gaps and with an elevated share of traditional life policies in their back-books. This is because insurers can invest the premiums earned on these policies at a higher return than was previously the case. Given that the guaranteed returns to policyholders remain unchanged, such rising returns may result in a net gain for the insurer. By contrast, rising returns on investments through unit-linked investment policies benefit solely policyholders and not the insurer.[47]A gradual increase in yields may also lead to greater demand for higher-quality bonds from insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs), as seen in recent quarters (Section 4.1). This may help to lower credit risk for ICPFs and alleviate concerns regarding the absorption of future issuances of sovereign bonds (Box 3), although it could contribute to funding challenges for higher-yielding non-financial corporations going forward (Chapter 2). At the same time, rising interest rates may result in valuation losses on portfolio holdings. Moreover, a sharp increase in yields, or a spike in financial market volatility, could expose ICPFs with interest rate derivative exposures to large margin calls. Recent stress events (such as the March 2020 financial market turmoil and the UK gilt market episode) demonstrate how liquidity pressures faced by ICPFs can propagate stress to other markets. This underscores the importance of strengthening liquidity preparedness to meet margin calls (Section 4.1, Chapter 5andBox 7).
ICPFs could be exposed to losses from ongoing corrections in real estate markets or could add to liquidity pressures for real estate investment funds (REIFs).In the low interest rate environment of the past decade that came to an end last year, ICPFs significantly increased their holdings of alternative, less liquid assets, especially real estate (Chart 4.8, panel a). While ICPF real estate exposures declined in value in 2022, their share of total assets actually increased on account of the falling valuations of other asset classes (i.e. securities and equities). Nonetheless, commercial real estate (CRE) prices have fallen as financial conditions have tightened (Chapter 1) and remain at risk of further correction. ICPFs generally have indirect exposure to real estate, mainly in the form of shares in euro area REIFs and other listed real estate companies (Chart 4.8, panel b). Further corrections in CRE markets would increase potential redemption pressures for, and forced sales by, REIFs (Section 4.2). Such scenarios would result in losses for investors in REIFs, including ICPFs. Equally, ICPFs could also contribute to growing liquidity pressures faced by REIFs. Further corrections in CRE markets would generally affect ICPF balance sheets, rather than their policyholders and beneficiaries, given that their exposures are mainly via non-unit-linked products or defined benefit pension schemes. This could incentivise ICPFs to rebalance their portfolios away from CRE, including divestment from REIFs. In the context of corrections in real estate markets, interconnectedness within the NBFI sector, as well as with the banking sector, warrants ongoing monitoring.
5.1 Preserving banking sector resilience during a turning financial cycle
The euro area banking sector demonstrated great resilience during both the pandemic and Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine, and continued to provide key financial services to the real economy.Euro area banks continue to enjoy comfortable capital and liquidity positions (Chapter 3), indicating that they are well placed to withstand adverse shocks.
Macroprudential policy action taken since the pandemic has further increased the financial system’s resilience to adverse shocks.Despite the challenges induced by a highly uncertain geopolitical and economic environment, the authorities have followed up on the lessons learnt from the pandemic and have made more active use of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), including by introducing a positive neutral rate.[48]Specifically, 12 countries have now activated the CCyB, increasing its weighted average rate in the banking union to 0.56%[49]in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Chart 5.1, panel a). Through these actions, the authorities have addressed existing vulnerabilities and have enhanced their capacity to make capital available by releasing the accumulated buffers when necessary. In this vein, several countries have increased sectoral capital buffers to address vulnerabilities related to residential real estate (RRE). These actions complement the significant RRE-related policy measures taken before the pandemic, which comprised both capital-based measures to enhance bank resilience and borrower-based measures to address flow risks in relation to exuberant real estate dynamics and deteriorating lending standards.[50]
The current environment, which combines elevated uncertainty with existing vulnerabilities and signs of a turning financial cycle, poses challenges for macroprudential policy.Against a background of low growth, high inflation and rising interest rates, there are already clear signs that the financial cycle is turning. These are particularly evident for the real estate sectors, where mortgage credit and house price dynamics have decelerated as of late and commercial real estate markets have entered a downturn (Chapter 1.5), while broader cyclical indicators such as the systemic risk indicator (SRI) are projected to decline further over the next few quarters (Chart 5.1, panel b). Nevertheless, vulnerabilities arising from high private sector indebtedness and house price overvaluation remain elevated in several banking union countries. Such vulnerabilities may amplify the effects of falling incomes, higher borrowing costs and real estate price corrections. Moreover, although banks and households are resilient overall, the likelihood of risk materialising has increased, as illustrated by the recent banking sector turmoil. In such an environment, it is of the utmost importance for macroprudential authorities to monitor developments closely and adjust their course of action when necessary.
In this context, macroprudential policy should continue to focus on ensuring that the financial system is resilient and that it remains able to withstand adversity while continuing to provide key services to the real economy.While there are some indications that credit supply is tightening on the back of perceived greater risk and higher funding costs, capital requirements are not a constraining factor as banks continue to exhibit sizeable capital headroom. The existing macroprudential capital buffers should therefore be maintained to preserve banking sector resilience, given that the conditions for their release are not yet in place. Moreover, notwithstanding the macroprudential measures that have recently been implemented, targeted increases in capital buffer requirements might still be considered in some countries. In countries with a framework that features a positive neutral rate for the CCyB, for example, building up the buffer towards the target rate would be welcome, provided that procyclical effects are avoided. The risk of the latter occurring continues to be mitigated by the existing capital headroom and a robust profitability outlook in the baseline scenario. At the same time, as downside risks have increased, banks should refrain from increasing payout ratios further and should instead focus on preserving their existing strong resilience. Finally, borrower-based measures under the remit of national authorities should continue to ensure that lending standards are sound and that household debt is sustainable, in a framework where capital-based and borrower-based measures complement each other. Existing borrower-based measures in the banking union are mostly calibrated as structural backstops and often incorporate flexibility in the form of exemptions or less stringent limits for specific types of borrowers, which may be used to guarantee the continued availability of credit while at the same time ensuring that lending standards remain sound. Where not yet in place, borrower-based measures could be introduced as structural backstops to preserve debt sustainability and promote sound lending standards, provided that procyclical effects are avoided.
Further strengthening of the robust and comprehensive EU regulatory framework for banks
The recent turmoil in the US and Swiss banking sectors highlighted the benefits of the broad and consistent application in all jurisdictions of global regulatory reforms introduced after the global financial crisis.The recent banking sector stresses in the United States and Switzerland further underline the importance of adequate capitalisation, appropriate liquidity levels and the transparent accounting of risks on bank balance sheets. To this end, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has agreed to take stock of the regulatory and supervisory implications of recent events, with a view to learning lessons. The Financial Stability Board has agreed to review the lessons learnt from the recent measures taken by the authorities to resolve financial institutions for the operation of the international resolution framework.
Although the bank regulatory framework is robust and widely applied in the EU, the full, faithful and timely implementation of outstanding regulatory reforms will help by strengthening the resilience of the European banking system still further.In the EU, the international standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to the extent that they have already been transposed into EU law, are applied to all EU banks irrespective of size. All EU significant institutions are stress-tested by the ECB at least once a year. Every other year they are stress-tested in cooperation with the European Banking Authority as part of the EU-wide stress test, with additional “thematic” stress tests conducted in the “off years”. Given recent banking tensions, the full, faithful and timely implementation of outstanding Basel III elements will ensure that banks continue to be well-capitalised. It will also foster trust in the EU banking system and provide additional levers for supervisory scrutiny.[51]The EU should strive, consistently with other major jurisdictions, to ensure that the outstanding Basel III standards enter into force by the agreed deadline of January 2025.
The recent surge in global financial stability risks is also a reminder to complete the banking union, and this should be a key priority for legislators in the coming months.Although there are instruments in place to address risks, minimise the likelihood of bank failures and manage such failures when they do occur, the European Commission’s proposal on crisis management and deposit insurance published on 18 April 2023 offers some very welcome ideas for further improving the framework, for example by making it suitable for a broader set of banks.[52]This could be achieved by introducing a general depositor preference which would rank all deposits equally in the creditor hierarchy, for example, or by improving access to the Single Resolution Fund. The Commission’s proposal should be swiftly advanced by co-legislators so that agreement can be reached within the current institutional cycle. The establishment of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, which will require all EU Member States to ratify the amended European Stability Mechanism Treaty, is another important way to further strengthen the bank resolution framework. In addition, the swift introduction of a European deposit insurance scheme is warranted to enhance depositor confidence and represents a key step towards completing the banking union. Finally, work should continue on liquidity in resolution to address possible liquidity shortfalls for those banks that, despite being recapitalised, still face a shortage of liquidity after resolution.[53]
Recent banking sector tensions in Switzerland have turned the spotlight onto the functioning of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments and the design of their contractual triggers.In the context of the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS on 19 March 2023[54], the Swiss authorities also announced the planned write-down of Credit Suisse Group’s AT1 instruments, whereby the write-down was to take place before the equity capital of the bank had been completely used up or written down.[55]In the EU, prudential regulation only requires the terms and conditions of AT1 instruments to include an automatic loss-absorption mechanism that can take the form of either a write-down (permanent or temporary) or a conversion triggered by the CET1 ratio falling below a contractually agreed threshold (which must be at least 5.125%). EU law does not require capital instruments to have permanent contractual write-down clauses that would be automatically activated if a bank were to receive public support.
The EU resolution framework has established a detailed sequence representing the order in which the shareholders and creditors of a troubled bank should bear losses.The EU resolution framework requires a write-down to follow a specific sequence which assumes that common equity instruments will absorb losses first, and only after these have been fully used will AT1 instruments be written down. ECB Banking Supervision, the Single Resolution Board and the European Banking Authority recently reiterated the fact that this sequence has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the Single Resolution Board and ECB Banking Supervision in crisis interventions.[56]
5.2 Enhancing resilience in the non-bank financial sector
Persistent structural vulnerabilities and the risk of renewed stress make it vital to enhance the resilience of the non-bank financial sector.Priority should be given to policies which reduce liquidity mismatch in money market and investment funds, tackle risks arising from financial and synthetic leverage across the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector and enhance liquidity preparedness across a broad range of institutions, especially in relation to margin calls. International policy initiatives are key in this regard, given the pronounced cross-border dimension of NBFI activities, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has pursued (or will pursue) policy work in all of these areas.[57]But as it will take time for regulatory reforms to be agreed internationally and implemented, authorities regulating and supervising NBFI entities should pay close attention to vulnerabilities in the sector and take an active role in strengthening resilience, within their mandate and existing policy frameworks.
Policy proposals for money market fund (MMF) reforms should be implemented as soon as possible.Following the pandemic-related market turmoil of March 2020, proposals to enhance the resilience of MMFs without unduly curtailing their economic function were developed at both the international and the European level. Such policy proposals focused on removing regulatory threshold effects, strengthening MMF liquidity requirements and improving the availability and usability of liquidity management tools.[58]In the EU, however, reform of the Money Market Fund Regulation has seen no progress to date but should be pursued as a matter of priority, while ensuring consistency with the international approach.
It is important to strengthen the liquidity management practices of open-ended funds (OEFs).In 2022, the FSB assessed the effectiveness of its 2017 recommendations on liquidity mismatch in OEFs.[59]The FSB analysis suggested that there has been no measurable reduction in the degree of structural liquidity mismatch since the recommendations were issued. The FSB concluded that while its recommendations remained broadly appropriate, “enhancing clarity and specificity on the intended policy outcomes the FSB Recommendations seek to achieve would make them more effective from a financial stability perspective.” Specifically, the daily creation and redemption of fund shares would remain appropriate for funds that mainly invest in assets that are liquid during normal as well as stressed periods (e.g. certain listed equities or government bonds). For funds invested in assets that are less liquid during normal periods but which could become illiquid under stress, such as corporate bond funds, daily dealings may be appropriate if the asset manager can demonstrate to the authorities that higher standards of liquidity management are being met. However, the asset manager should consider longer notice periods or a lower redemption frequency to reduce liquidity mismatch vulnerability, if the costs of selling assets cannot be passed on to redeeming investors by anti-dilution measures. Finally, it would not be appropriate for open-ended funds holding a significant share of assets (such as real estate) that are illiquid even under normal market conditions to offer daily liquidity to investors. In this regard, national regulators and authorities supervising property funds in the EU have devised a range of policy measures.[60]For example, in Germany the minimum notice period for property funds is 12 months and the minimum holding period is 24 months,[61]while the Central Bank of Ireland has recently introduced a minimum liquidity time frame of at least 12 months, consisting of the notice period plus the settlement period.[62]In Italy, real estate funds are structured as closed-end funds that limit investors’ rights to redeem their units.
Price-based liquidity management tools can usefully complement – but not replace – measures that better align asset liquidity with redemption terms.Enhancing the availability and use of anti-dilution liquidity management tools should form part of the policy response to vulnerabilities in the OEF sector. In particular, OEFs should be able to pass on to redeeming investors the explicit and implicit costs of selling assets under both normal and stressed market conditions. This could be achieved by employing price-based anti-dilution tools, such as swing pricing or anti-dilution levies, which could help mitigate first-mover advantages.[63]However, if the swing factors or levies are not appropriately calibrated or capped, they cannot effectively mitigate first-mover incentives.[64]Price-based liquidity management tools may also be difficult to use in stressed market conditions when liquidity has dried up and price information may be missing or distorted. Therefore, to avoid withdrawals causing liquidity strains during such periods, it is important to ensure that asset liquidity is commensurate with redemption terms.[65]In particular, as discussed above, longer notice periods might be warranted for funds investing in less liquid assets, and higher liquidity buffers might be needed for funds offering daily redemptions.
Recent stress episodes and the associated liquidity challenges have underlined the need to reduce procyclicality by enhancing margining practices as well as the NBFI sector’s liquidity preparedness to meet margin and collateral calls.Since the March 2020 market turmoil, the NBFI sector has repeatedly faced periods of high market volatility and surging liquidity needs arising from margin and collateral calls (Box 7). The higher margin calls were intended to protect central counterparties (CCPs) and market participants from heightened counterparty exposure in the face of high price volatility in underlying markets. It is, however, important to reduce procyclical demand for liquidity arising from margining practices by increasing the transparency and predictability of initial margin models and by assessing their responsiveness to market stress.[66]In addition, these episodes also exposed vulnerabilities arising from inadequate liquidity preparedness to meet margin and collateral calls. Enhancing the NBFI sector’s liquidity preparedness should include ensuring that liquidity risk management and contingency planning frameworks are robust, while the challenges posed by relying on the same sources of liquidity as other players during periods of stress should be considered. Given the interplay between leverage and liquidity risk arising from margin and collateral calls, addressing the risks associated with NBFI sector leverage would help to reduce the risk of inadequate liquidity preparedness. Finally, the policy work carried out on margining should be complemented by strengthening the global risk assessment, for instance, by enhancing information sharing of derivatives data across jurisdictions and tackling data gaps.
Proposals to make the clearing system in the EU safer are currently being developed and include measures to enhance model transparency and reduce excessive reliance on CCPs based outside the EU.European Commission proposals included in its capital markets union package aim to make EU clearing safer and more resilient.[67]Measures such as enhancing transparency and reducing the impact of intraday margins are in line with international efforts to improve margining practices. The proposals also include measures aimed at reducing excessive exposure to Tier 2 CCPs.[68]An example of this is an active account requirement which would require EU market participants to clear a portion of their derivatives through active accounts at EU CCPs.[69]The active account will need to be carefully calibrated if the requirement is to sufficiently reduce tail risks stemming from third-country Tier 2 CCPs. In addition, the calibration will need to take account of any potential negative effects on financial stability and market liquidity for EU market participants, for which it will be important to allow an adequate phase-in period.
Given the complexities involved in the use of leverage in an interconnected financial system, a policy response needs to take a holistic perspective across NBFI sector entities and activities.A key priority for the FSB should be to develop a globally consistent approach for addressing risk deriving from either financial or synthetic leverage in the NBFI sector. For this purpose, it is important for work to continue on globally consistent metrics, on improving data quality and coverage, as well as on information-sharing to assess leverage-related risks across NBFI sector entities and activities. Such work should be complemented by identifying gaps in policy frameworks globally, especially where financial entities are not subject to adequate leverage rules. The provision of leverage through banks and broker-dealers, including via repo transactions, should be considered as part of a holistic approach to NBFI sector leverage. The policy response should also consider how haircuts and margining in derivatives markets disincentivise excessive leverage in the NBFI sector, while it should also take into account the potential negative impact on the propensity to hedge for end users. Where leverage rules are already part of regulatory frameworks, as is the case for investment funds in the EU, consideration should be given to whether existing rules should be enhanced from a financial stability perspective. Moreover, supervisors of NBFI sector entities should actively identify excessively leveraged institutions and tackle the resulting risk. This could be achieved by requiring more severe stress test scenarios, for example, or by imposing leverage limits, as provided for under the European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.[70]
5.3 Other ongoing policy initiatives that support euro area financial stability
A	Gauging the interplay between market liquidity and funding liquidity
Prepared by Nander de Vette, Benjamin Klaus, Simon Kördel and Andrzej Sowiński
The ability of market participants to access funding and conduct transactions in an efficient way is a prerequisite for financial stability, providing shock-absorption capacity and, in turn, limiting the scope for shock amplification. Market liquidity and funding liquidity are inherently connected. When market liquidity evaporates, financial market pricing becomes less reliable and tends to overreact, leading to increased market volatility and higher funding costs. Funding liquidity enables market participants to take exposures onto their balance sheets, thus absorbing fluctuations in demand and supply in the name of efficient market functioning. Under extreme conditions, markets can stop functioning altogether. While liquidity has many dimensions, from a systemic perspective the interplay between market liquidity and funding liquidity[71]is key, as these two dimensions can reinforce each other in ways that generate liquidity spirals. Cyclical factors such as the business cycle, systemic leverage, as well as monetary and fiscal policy affect the probability of liquidity stress arising. In the light of the current challenges of high financial market volatility, increased risk of recession, bouts of heightened risk aversion and monetary policy normalisation, this special feature constructs composite indicators for market liquidity and funding liquidity. It also attempts to identify what can cause poor market liquidity and funding liquidity conditions and to show how the two dimensions interact in the euro area.
B	Key linkages between banks and the non-bank financial sector

Banks are connected to non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector entities via loans, securities and derivatives exposures, as well as funding dependencies. Linkages with the NBFI sector expose banks to liquidity, market and credit risks. Funding from NBFI entities would appear to be the most likely and strongest spillover channel, given that NBFI entities maintain their liquidity buffers primarily as deposits and very short-term repo transactions with banks. At the same time, direct credit exposures are smaller and are often related to NBFI entities associated with banking groups. Links with NBFI entities are highly concentrated in a small group of systemically important banks, whose sizeable capital and liquidity buffers are essential to mitigate spillover risks.
C	Climate change and sovereign risk
Prepared by Stephan Fahr, Margherita Giuzio, Clementine Mc Sweeny Pourtalet, Martina Spaggiari and Josep Maria Vendrell Simón[72]
Climate change can have a negative effect on sovereign balance sheets directly (when contingent liabilities materialise) and indirectly (when it has an impact on the real economy and the financial system).Part of this risk is embedded in the analyses of the macroeconomic costs of climate change which show that transition and physical risks can significantly reduce GDP growth and fiscal buffers. This special feature highlights the contingent sovereign risks that stem from an untimely or disorderly transition to a net-zero economy and from more frequent and severe natural catastrophes. It also looks at the positive role that governments can play in reducing climate-related financial risks and incentivising adaptation. If the recent trend of ever-lower emissions across the EU is to be sustained, further public sector investment is essential. In this context, the progress made to strengthen green capital markets has fostered government issuance of green and sustainable bonds to finance the transition. While putting significant resources into adaptation projects can increase countries’ resilience to climate change, the economic costs of extreme climate-related events are still set to rise materially in the EU. Only a quarter of disaster losses are currently insured and fiscal support has mitigated related macroeconomic and financial stability risks in the past. Looking ahead, vulnerabilities arising from contingent liabilities may increase in countries with high physical risk and a large insurance protection gap. If these risks rise alongside sovereign debt sustainability concerns, the impact on financial stability could be amplified by feedback loops that see sovereign credit conditions and ratings deteriorate."
174,2023-05-25,—,Annual Report 2022,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/annual-reports-financial-statements/annual/html/ecb.ar2022~8ae51d163b.en.html,"
2022 was a turning point for the ECB’s monetary policy. The inflation outlook changed abruptly as two types of shock hit the economy at the same time. First, the euro area underwent an unprecedented series of negative supply shocks caused by pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, Russia’s unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis. This significantly increased input costs for all sectors of the economy. Second, there was a positive demand shock triggered by the reopening of the economy after the pandemic. That allowed firms to pass their rising costs through to prices much faster and more strongly than in the past.
We had already announced, at the end of 2021, that we would gradually reduce net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) and would end them under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at the end of March 2022. But our overall policy stance was still highly accommodative, having been tailored to the environment of very low inflation in the past decade and the deflationary risks early in the pandemic. So we took a series of steps to normalise that stance and respond rapidly to the emerging inflation challenge.
In March we speeded up the reduction of net purchases under the APP and in April said we expected to discontinue them in the third quarter. In July we then raised the key ECB interest rates for the first time in 11 years, hiking them again in a series of large steps at the policy meetings that followed. The pace of this adjustment was an important signal to the public of our determination to bring down inflation. That helped anchor inflation expectations even as inflation accelerated.
In parallel, we acted to ensure that – as monetary policy was normalised – our policy stance would continue to be transmitted smoothly via financial markets throughout the euro area. This was achieved via two key measures. First, we decided to apply flexibility in reinvesting maturing securities in the PEPP portfolio to counter risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. Second, we launched a new Transmission Protection Instrument.
But as the inflation outlook evolved it became clear that achieving a broadly neutral monetary policy stance would not in itself suffice. Inflation was projected to be too far above our 2% medium-term target for too long, and we saw signs that it was becoming more persistent, with price pressures broadening and underlying inflation strengthening. In this setting, we needed to bring interest rates into restrictive territory and dampen demand.
So in December, following our last policy meeting of the year, we announced that interest rates would still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our target. At the same time, we said that, while the key ECB interest rates were our primary tool for setting the policy stance, we would begin reducing the APP securities portfolio from March 2023 at a measured and predictable pace. This also followed a decision in October to recalibrate the terms and conditions of the third series of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations, removing a deterrent to voluntary early repayment of outstanding funds. Monetary policy assets on our balance sheet declined by around €830 billion between end-June (when net asset purchases ended) and end-December, contributing to the normalisation of our balance sheet.
In addition to our measures to combat high inflation, we continued to examine and address wider threats to our mandate stemming from a changing climate. In 2022 we took further steps to incorporate climate change considerations into our monetary policy operations. This included conducting a first climate stress test of several of the financial exposures on our balance sheet and making progress in better capturing the impact of climate change in our macroeconomic modelling. As of October, we started to decarbonise the corporate bond holdings in our monetary policy portfolios by tilting them towards issuers with a better climate performance. We also decided to limit the share of assets issued by non-financial corporations with a high carbon footprint that counterparties can pledge as collateral when borrowing from the Eurosystem.
In 2022 we continued our efforts to remain at the forefront of technological developments in payment systems and market infrastructures. This involved preparations for the transition from TARGET2 to a new, modernised real-time gross settlement system, as well as several measures to ensure pan-European reachability of payment service providers in the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system. Instant payment transactions via TIPS increased 17-fold in 2022 compared with 2021.
The year also marked the 20th anniversary of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, a milestone in European history and a tangible symbol of European integration. To date, cash remains the most frequently used means of payment among Europeans, accounting for almost 60% of payments, and there is no doubt that it will continue to play an important role in people’s lives. But as the economy becomes increasingly digital, we need to ensure that Europeans also have access to safe, efficient and convenient digital payment methods. This is why the Eurosystem is exploring the possibility of issuing a digital euro. As part of the ongoing investigation phase, the Eurosystem agreed in 2022 on the main use cases and several key design decisions for a digital euro.
As the year came to a close, the euro area expanded again, with Croatia becoming its newest member on 1 January 2023 – demonstrating that the euro remains an attractive currency that brings stability to its members.
None of the above would have been possible without the dedicated efforts of ECB staff and their collective determination to serve the people of Europe.

Global growth decelerated in 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, high inflation and tighter financial conditions weighed on both advanced and emerging market economies. Global inflation pressures rose significantly, fuelled by high and volatile commodity prices, global supply bottlenecks and tight labour markets. The euro weakened against the US dollar but appreciated against many other currencies, and was thus more stable in nominal effective terms.
In the euro area inflation increased to 8.4% in 2022 from 2.6% in 2021. The rise mainly reflected a surge in energy and food prices, triggered by the war in Ukraine. Past supply bottlenecks and some pent-up demand from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, together with high input costs in production due to the rise in energy prices, increased price pressures across many sectors of the economy. After a strong first half of the year, when particularly the services sector benefited from the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions, growth slowed in the euro area, largely owing to the effects of the war in Ukraine.
1.1Slowing economic activity across advanced and emerging market economies
Global economic growth dropped to 3.4% in 2022 from 6.4% in 2021, as Russia’s war in Ukraine and other geopolitical factors created uncertainty, inflation rose and financial conditions tightened.The slowdown was broad-based across advanced and emerging market economies (Chart 1.1, panel a). It followed a strong recovery in 2021, mainly due to the easing of pandemic-related restrictions and a subsequent rise in global demand. In early 2022 the war in Ukraine inflicted another major shock on the world economy. It led to a surge and very high volatility in commodity prices, and undermined food security, especially for emerging market economies. Rising energy and food prices amplified inflationary pressures globally, reducing households’ real disposable incomes and leading central banks to swiftly tighten monetary policy. In an environment of rising interest rates, falling stock market valuations and heightened risk aversion, global financial conditions tightened significantly.
Global trade growth fell in 2022, although it remained above the historical average (Chart 1.1, panel b). The drop was mainly due to weak manufacturing activity. In the first half of the year global trade was still relatively resilient since the effects of Russia’s war in Ukraine and lingering global supply bottlenecks were partially compensated by the recovery in travel and transportation services as pandemic-related restrictions were relaxed. In the second half of the year, however, trade slowed significantly, reflecting in particular lower imports from emerging market economies. While global value chain integration has stagnated since the global financial crisis, the pandemic and geopolitical developments have increased incentives for firms to return to domestic production and diversify their suppliers, which could in future lead to a fragmentation of global value chains.
Global inflationary pressures – as reflected both in headline inflation measures and in measures of inflation excluding energy and food – increased significantly in 2022 (Chart 1.2). Inflationary pressures were fuelled by high and volatile commodity prices, global supply bottlenecks, prolonged reopening effects from the pandemic, and tight labour markets. In the countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), headline inflation peaked in aggregate at 10.7% in October, then started to decline. Inflation excluding energy and food peaked in the same month, at 7.8%. In most countries the surge in inflation over the first half of the year mainly reflected higher commodity prices. The increase in inflation excluding energy and food later in the year indicated that inflationary pressures had become increasingly broad-based, both in advanced and in emerging market economies. Underlying inflationary pressures were also fuelled by increasing wage pressures, as labour markets across key advanced economies remained tight despite the slowdown in global economic activity.
Energy prices increased sharply during 2022 but eased to some extent towards the end of the year. Oil prices increased by 6%, driven by supply disruptions, mainly due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which caused a spike in oil prices in spring. Supply disruptions were partly counterbalanced by lower demand amid the global economic slowdown and lockdowns in China. The invasion of Ukraine and reduced gas supplies to Europe also led to unprecedented spikes in European gas prices, which increased by more than 240% in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion relative to the beginning of the year. The surge in gas prices left a significant mark on European energy prices in general as it also led to an increase in wholesale electricity prices. Gas prices moderated in the last quarter, as increased imports of liquified natural gas (LNG) and measures to save gas meant the EU had high gas storage levels at the start of the heating season, leaving gas priceslargely similar to pre-invasion levels at the end of 2022 but still 14% higher than at the beginning of the year.
The euro depreciated by 6% against the US dollar in 2022 but was more stable in nominal effective terms (+0.8%), albeit with considerable within-year variation. The dollar strengthened against most other currencies, as the US Federal Reserve System tightened monetary policy and global risk sentiment was subdued. The euro also came under pressure from high energy prices and the deteriorating economic outlook for the euro area. However, it appreciated against other major currencies, such as the pound sterling, the Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
The major risks to the outlook for global economic growth at the end of 2022, amid high uncertainty, included greater repercussions from the war in Ukraine, spillovers from a more significant slowdown of the Chinese economy and tighter financial conditions due to a swifter withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus in key advanced economies. The latter was seen as potentially triggering more significant capital outflows from emerging market economies and disrupting financial markets. In addition, global commodity markets remained sensitive to supply risks. Higher commodity prices and a stronger transmission to consumer price inflation would erode purchasing power more significantly and could weigh on global demand. Renewed pressures in global supply chains and an increasing fragmentation of the global trading system could also hamper growth and fuel inflation.
1.2 Growth in the euro area weakened substantially in the course of 2022
Euro area real GDP grew by 3.5% in 2022, after growing 5.3% in 2021 as the economy recovered from the pandemic-related recession (Chart 1.3). Growth in 2022 mainly reflected a robust contribution from domestic demand. By the end of the year output in the euro area was 2.4% above its pre-pandemic level, i.e. compared with the final quarter of 2019. However, the growth performance varied markedly across countries, reflecting the different economic structures and the extent to which individual countries benefited from the reopening of the services sector and were affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As the strong rebound in demand for contact-intensive services in the first half of the year lost steam, soaring energy prices started to dampen spending and production throughout the economy. The euro area also felt the impact of the weakening in global demand and tighter monetary policy in many major economies amid high economic uncertainty and falling confidence for businesses as well as households.
In 2022 monetary policy support was withdrawn while fiscal policies focused on protection against energy price rises. While the normalisation of the monetary policy stance started in December 2021, monetary policy remained accommodative overall, particularly in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, however, monetary policy support was rapidly withdrawn in unprecedentedly large steps (see Section 2.1). Euro area governments introduced fiscal policy measures to attenuate the impact of high energy prices. The measures were largely non-targeted, rather than primarily aimed at protecting the most vulnerable households and firms. About half of the measures had an impact on the marginal cost of energy consumption rather than being tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. At the same time, structural policies continued to be pursued to increase the euro area’s growth potential. The ongoing implementation of countries’ investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme made an important contribution to these objectives.
Private consumption growth was resilient in 2022 as labour income remained firm and savings supported pent-up demand (Chart 1.4). The positive dynamics were underpinned mainly by consumption of services, which rose sharply as the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted. Nevertheless, private consumption growth slowed down in the course of the year, owing to weak spending on non-durable goods amid declining real disposable income growth and lingering uncertainty. Overall, household spending increased by 4.3% in 2022. With strong growth in employment and the gradual acceleration in wages, labour income, which is typically used for consumption more than other sources of income, was the main contributor to disposable income growth in 2022. However, rising inflation increasingly dampened real disposable income towards the end of the year, outweighing the favourable effects of the resilient labour market and fiscal support.
Non-construction investment growth – a proxy for private non-housing investment – fluctuated strongly in 2022 (Chart 1.5).[1]Excluding the particularly volatile Irish intangible investment component,[2]non-construction investment growth slowed throughout the year. It started the year on a strong note, spurred by high demand, robust corporate profits and favourable financing conditions, as pandemic-related restrictions were lifted. However, Russia’s war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis, together with the reduction of monetary policy stimulus, meant rising energy and financing costs for firms. Alongside slowing domestic and global demand in an environment of high uncertainty, this reduced their incentives to invest. In level terms, non-construction investment was by the end of 2022 well below its level in the fourth quarter of 2019, which had been boosted by a considerable rise in intangible investment. Excluding Irish intangibles, it had already recovered by the end of 2020. Overall, non-construction investment grew by 5.2% in 2022.
Housing investment grew at a strong pace in the first quarter of 2022, as housing demand was sustained by favourable financing conditions, the accumulation of a large stock of savings and income support measures. It recoiled in the following quarters, however, as demand weakened on the back of rising mortgage rates and uncertainty related to the war in Ukraine, while supply suffered from soaring costs stemming from shortages of materials and labour. At the end of 2022 housing investment was around 3% above its pre-pandemic level, having grown by 1.1% in 2022 as a whole.
The euro area goods trade balance shifted into deficit in 2022, largely owing to the higher cost of energy imports and a subdued export performance. On the imports side, robust growth driven by energy stockpiling and increasing intermediate goods imports was accompanied by strongly rising prices, especially for energy imports. Goods exports were hampered by a re-intensification of supply chain bottlenecks in the first half of 2022. They subsequently remained subdued as global demand weakened while supply chain issues improved only gradually. In contrast, services exports, particularly tourism services, benefited from the easing and gradual elimination of pandemic-related restrictions. Overall, the contribution from trade to euro area GDP growth was broadly neutral in 2022.
The labour market continued its marked recovery from the pandemic alongside the rebound in euro area economic activity. By the fourth quarter of 2022 total employment and total hours worked had surpassed their levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 by 2.3% and 0.6% respectively (Chart 1.6). The labour force participation rate in the age group 15-74 years increased to a level of 65.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022, 0.5 percentage points above its level in the fourth quarter of 2019. In line with employment growth, the unemployment rate declined further, from an already historically low level of 6.9% in January 2022 to 6.7% at the end of 2022 (Chart 1.7). There was a drop in recourse to job retention schemes, which had limited job lay-offs during the crisis, and workers under such schemes largely resumed their normal hours.
The euro area labour market remained resilient overall in 2022 despite Russia’s war in Ukraine, as also indicated by continued high levels of job vacancies towards the end of the year. Still, labour market developments and survey indicators of labour demand moderated in the second half of the year. Box 1 compares the labour market developments in the United States and the euro area with a view to better understanding the differences and similarities in the drivers of the recovery from the pandemic and prospects for developments in employment and wages.
1.3Fiscal policy measures to address a cost-of-living crisis
In 2022 euro area governments were confronted, for the third year in a row, with new challenges that required reactive fiscal policies. The euro area’s general government deficit ratio decreased to 3.5% of GDP in 2022 from 5.1% in 2021 (Chart 1.8) as support measures related to the pandemic expired and were only partly offset by new support measures. The latter were aimed at countering rising energy prices and their consequences, namely an increased cost of living for households and higher costs for companies. To a smaller extent, they also financed spending related to Russia’s war in Ukraine. The same developments are reflected in the fiscal stance, which tightened moderately in 2022 for the second year in a row.[3]As can be seen in the chart below, however, only slightly over a third of the loosening in 2020 has so far been reversed.
When energy prices started to increase more strongly at the end of 2021, euro area governments put in place support measures amounting to around 0.2% of GDP. These comprised subsidies, indirect tax cuts and transfers to households and companies. In 2022, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, governments swiftly expanded such measures to around 1.9% of GDP (Chart 1.9), which also included capital transfers to energy-producing firms. In addition they increased government support by 0.2% of GDP owing to, inter alia, refugee-related and military spending. The energy and inflation support measures were compensated only to a small extent by new financing measures such as higher direct taxation of energy producers making large windfall profits. This implied that their net budgetary effect remained sizeable, at around 1.7% of GDP. In sum, the gross discretionary support (energy and inflation support plus refugee-related and military spending) was thus 2.1% of euro area GDP and, net of new financing, 1.9% of GDP (Chart 1.10).
Support measures should be temporary, targeted to the most vulnerable households and companies, as well as tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. Fiscal measures falling short of these principles are likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures, which would necessitate a stronger monetary policy response, and to weigh on public finances. Given that only a small share of these measures was targeted (12% according to the December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections[4]), it is important that governments adjust these measures accordingly.
The pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine and fiscal expenditures to compensate for high inflation rates represent consecutive major shocks to public finances. These occurred against a background of already elevated government debt-to-GDP ratios. While the pandemic led to high costs for public finances and the war in Ukraine has intensified risks to economic growth prospects, the net impact of the inflationary shock on debt levels is less clear-cut. While higher tax receipts will have some downward effect on the debt ratio, high inflation has prompted a normalisation of monetary policy and thus rising financing costs. Moreover, government expenditures tend to eventually catch up with receipts, while inflation negatively affects output growth.
Pressures on public finances are likely to increase. These will arise from, among other factors, the need to step up the energy transition and to increase investment in a greener and more digital economy, on top of rising fiscal costs due to an ageing population. It is therefore important that the increased vulnerability of euro area public finances is addressed through both growth-enhancing reforms and a gradual reduction in high debt ratios. This will require a swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme and prudent fiscal policies for years to come.
1.4 A sharp increase in euro area inflation
Headline inflation in the euro area as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 8.4% on average in 2022, sharply up from an average of 2.6% in 2021. Inflation surged throughout the year and led to high rates of around 10% year-on-year in the later months. Energy prices were the most important component behind the increase in headline inflation, and food prices also rose increasingly strongly, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. In addition, persistent supply bottlenecks for industrial goods, recovering demand following the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, especially in the services sector, and the depreciation of the euro added to inflationary pressures (Chart 1.11). Overall, price pressures spread across an increasing number of sectors, in part owing to the indirect impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. The divergence of inflation rates across euro area countries also increased significantly, reflecting primarily different degrees of exposure to the commodity and energy price shocks. Most measures of underlying inflation recorded a sizeable rise over the year. At the end of 2022, the factors behind the inflation surge were expected to unwind and inflation was expected to ease over the course of 2023.
Developments in the energy prices component accounted directly for almost half of the increase in headline inflation over the course of 2022. Energy inflation was already high at the start of the year, then rose sharply further after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine owing to concerns that the supply of energy could be disrupted. In October, energy inflation stood at 41.5%, with large contributions from gas and electricity prices, for which the underlying wholesale prices had decoupled from oil prices. Governments adopted sizeable fiscal measures that helped to dampen the short-term impact of rising energy prices somewhat (see Section 1.3). The varying intensity of these measures contributed to the differences in energy inflation among euro area countries, with the Baltic States recording the highest numbers. The surge in energy costs also placed substantial upward pressure on food prices, affecting them with various lags. The war in Ukraine had also a more direct impact on food prices, as both Russia and Ukraine are important exporters of grain and the minerals used in the production of fertilisers.[5]The contribution of total food inflation to headline HICP inflation reached 2.9 percentage points in December 2022, substantially above the level in 2021, reflecting a rise in both the unprocessed and processed components.
Indicators of underlying inflation picked up substantially over the course of 2022, although with some signs of flattening towards the end of the year. HICP inflation excluding energy and food was, at 2.3%, already above the ECB’s inflation target at the beginning of the year and increased to 5.2% in December. On average, non-energy industrial goods inflation rose to 4.6% in 2022, while services inflation reached 3.5%. Price pressure resulted largely from the same factors: very strong input cost rises, related in part to the increase in energy commodity prices, and pandemic-related factors such as global supply bottlenecks and reopening effects. The depreciation of the euro over most of the year also contributed to inflationary pressures. As supply chain disruptions gradually eased over the second half of 2022 and commodity prices came down, pressures at the early stages of the pricing chain moderated after the summer. Yet lagged pass-through effects kept inflation high. Pent-up demand after the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions contributed to a favourable pricing environment for firms, in particular for contact-intensive services. Overall, price pressures became increasingly persistent and broad-based. This led all indicators of underlying inflation to increase.
Domestic cost pressures in the euro area, as measured by the growth in the GDP deflator, increased on average by 4.7% in 2022, continuing the path started in 2021 (Chart 1.12). Pressures from wage developments remained moderate in the first half of the year but became more pronounced towards the year-end. Annual growth in compensation per employee rose in 2022, reaching 4.5% on average after 3.9% in 2021 and an average of 1.7% in the pre-pandemic period (between 2015 and 2019). The rise compared with the previous year was partly due to an increase in average hours worked as the impact of job retention schemes faded. Negotiated wages, which were affected to a lesser extent by the impact of government measures, rose by an average annual rate of 2.8% in 2022, slightly below actual wage growth, reflecting the intensification of wage pressures towards the end of the year. Inflation compensation became an increasingly important aspect in wage negotiations during 2022, especially since labour markets remained strong. Increased labour costs were to some extent offset by an increase in labour productivity. Unit profits across sectors contributed positively to the GDP deflator over the year, indicating that firms were able to pass input cost increases through to selling prices.
Longer-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters, which had stood at 1.9% in late 2021, edged up during the year, reaching 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Chart 1.13). Other survey data, such as from the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts and from Consensus Economics, also suggested longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at or just above 2%, despite higher expectations for the shorter term. Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation, particularly the five-year inflation-linked swap rate five years ahead, declined at the beginning of the year in anticipation of a tightening of monetary policy but, following the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine, gradually picked up, standing at 2.38% in late December. Importantly, however, market-based measures of inflation compensation are not a straightforward measure of market participants’ actual inflation expectations, since they incorporate risk premia to compensate for inflation uncertainty.
1.5 Tighter credit and financing conditions as monetary policy normalises
With inflationary pressures rising throughout the economy (see Section 1.4), the ECB took decisive action in 2022 to normalise monetary policy and prevent longer-term inflation expectations from becoming unanchored above its 2% target (see Section 2.1). Risk-free long-term interest rates were more volatile than in 2021, partly because of very high uncertainty about inflation and the reaction of monetary authorities around the world, including the euro area. Long-term yields increased overall. The euro area ten-year GDP-weighted average of government bond yields closely followed developments in the risk-free rate (Chart 1.14). At the country level, despite some differences, movements in sovereign spreads were contained overall, in part owing to the Governing Council’s announcement in June that it would apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio and the approval in July of the Transmission Protection Instrument (see Section 2.1). The euro area GDP-weighted average of ten-year nominal government bond yields stood at 3.26% on 31 December 2022, almost 300 basis points higher than at the end of 2021.
Expectations of higher interest rates and of lower long-term earnings growth put downward pressure on stock prices. Overall, euro area equity prices were very volatile and declined in 2022. The broad indices of euro area non-financial corporation and bank equity prices (Chart 1.15) stood at around 16% and 4.4% below their respective end-2021 levels on 31 December 2022. Since corporate bond yields also increased sizeably, in both the investment grade and high-yield categories, euro area financing conditions tightened considerably.
Against the background of monetary policy normalisation and general market developments, bank funding costs and bank lending rates increased steeply in 2022. The overall upward trend in bank bond yields, the gradual increase in the remuneration of customer deposits, and a change in the terms and conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) towards the end of the year all contributed to an increase in bank funding costs. As a result, nominal bank lending rates increased during 2022 to levels last seen in 2014. Theeuro area bank lending surveyalso indicated that banks’ credit standards (i.e. internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) for loans to households and firms tightened substantially. The composite bank lending rate for loans to households for house purchase stood at 2.94% at the end of 2022, up by a cumulative 163 basis points since the end of 2021, and the equivalent rate for non-financial corporations stood at 3.41%, up 205 basis points (Chart 1.14). Viewed in relation to the changes in the key ECB interest rates, such developments were broadly in line with past periods of monetary policy tightening, and the differences in lending rates across countries remained contained. This suggested that changes in the ECB’s monetary policy were transmitting smoothly across the euro area.
Credit growth increased in the first half of 2022, but new lending moderated after the summer on the back of tighter credit conditions (Chart 1.16). The annual growth rate of bank loans to households weakened to 3.8% for the year, reflecting rising interest rates, tighter credit standards and lower consumer confidence. The annual growth rate of bank loans to firms still increased in 2022, to 6.3%, although this concealed differing developments in the course of the year. Nominal growth was robust for most of the year, reflecting firms’ need to finance working capital and inventories in view of continued supply bottlenecks and elevated costs. In the last months of the year, however, bank lending to firms declined sharply, reflecting the impact of tighter financing conditions on supply and demand factors. Net issuance of debt securities, which had become more expensive for firms, also decreased during the year. In total, the net flows of external financing to non-financial corporations declined in 2022, mainly on account of a reduction in inter-company loans as a form of financing (Chart 1.17). Thesurvey on the access to finance of enterprisesindicated, moreover, that firms were increasingly pessimistic about the future availability of most sources of external financing.
The pace of deposit accumulation moderated from the high levels recorded during the pandemic, owing primarily to increased expenditure on the back of rising prices and to higher returns on alternative forms of saving in line with the normalisation of monetary policy. The annual growth of broad money (M3) moderated further to 4.1% in 2022 (Chart 1.16), reflecting the end of net asset purchases by the Eurosystem in July, lower credit creation in the last quarter of 2022, and net monetary outflows to the rest of the world linked to the euro area’s higher energy bill.
The ECB continued to normalise its monetary policy in 2022 to combat exceptionally high inflation, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and lasting effects from the pandemic. In the first phase of normalisation the Governing Council ended net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at the end of March and under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the beginning of July. In the second phase the key ECB rates were raised for the first time in more than a decade, and the deposit facility rate left negative territory for the first time since 2014. Policy rates increased by a cumulative 250 basis points over the last four meetings of the year, which included the largest individual rate hikes on record (Chart 2.1). The Governing Council also approved theTransmission Protection Instrument to ensure an orderly transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. In addition, the flexibility available for reinvestments under the PEPP served as a first line of defence to counter pandemic-related risks to transmission. In December, the Governing Council decided to decrease the monetary policy securities portfolio acquired by the Eurosystem under the APP, at a measured and predictable pace, from March 2023 onwards. The Eurosystem’s balance sheet reached a historical high in June 2022 at €8.8 trillion, before declining to €8.0 trillion by the year’s end. The reduction stemmed mainly from maturing operations and early repayments under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Early repayments were supported by the Governing Council’s decision in October to change the terms and conditions for TLTRO III operations. In line with the normalisation of monetary policy, the ECB also began phasing out collateral easing measures introduced in response to the pandemic, thus gradually restoring pre-pandemic risk tolerance levels in the Eurosystem’s credit operations.
2.1 Withdrawing monetary policy accommodation
In early 2022 the euro area economy continued to recover from the pandemic and the labour market improved further, not least as a result of the support provided by public policies. However, the near-term outlook for economic growth remained subdued amid surging new coronavirus infections due to the spread of the Omicron variant. Shortages of materials, equipment and labour continued to hold back output in some industries, and high energy costs were already hurting real incomes. Inflation in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had risen sharply in the preceding months and was again higher than projected in January. This was primarily driven by higher energy costs, which were pushing up prices across many sectors, as well as by higher food prices. On the basis of data at the beginning of the year, the Governing Council assessed in February that inflation was likely to remain elevated for longer than previously expected but to decline over the course of the year.
The Governing Council therefore confirmed the decision taken at its monetary policy meeting in December 2021 to continue reducing the pace of asset purchases step by step over the following quarters. It had decided to discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022, and to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. The Governing Council emphasised that, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments could be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardised the attainment of price stability. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it was still recovering from the fallout of the pandemic.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February was a watershed for Europe. The unjustified war had a material impact on economic activity and inflation in 2022, including in the euro area, through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international trade and weaker confidence. In March the Governing Council assessed that the extent of these effects would depend on how the war evolved, on the impact of sanctions and on possible further measures. In recognition of the highly uncertain environment, the Governing Council considered a range of scenarios in addition to the usual ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. The impact of the war was assessed in the context of incoming data that indicated still solid underlying conditions for the euro area economy, helped by considerable policy support. The ongoing recovery of the economy was boosted by the fading impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Supply bottlenecks were showing some signs of easing and the labour market was improving further. Still, in the baseline of the March staff projections, which incorporated a first assessment of the implications of the war, GDP growth was revised downwards for the near term. Prior to the Governing Council’s March monetary policy meeting, inflation had continued to be higher than projected mainly because of unexpectedly high energy costs. Price rises had also become more broad-based across sectors. Compared with the December 2021 Eurosystem staff projections, the baseline for HICP inflation in the March projections was revised significantly upwards, while longer-term inflation expectations across a range of measures were in line with the ECB’s 2% medium-term inflation target.
On the basis of this updated assessment and taking into account the uncertain environment, the Governing Council revised the purchase schedule for the APP at its March monetary policy meeting, with monthly net purchases to be €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June. The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter was to depend on incoming data. The Governing Council also confirmed its prior decision that any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates would take place some time after the end of net purchases under the APP. The path for the key ECB interest rates was still determined by the Governing Council’s forward guidance, reflecting its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.
Inflation again rose significantly in May, mainly due to the impact of the war and a continued surge in energy and food prices. At the same time, inflation pressures had broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly. Against this backdrop and the June baseline Eurosystem staff projections, which saw inflation above the 2% target at the end of the projection horizon, the Governing Council decided on 9 June to take further steps in normalising monetary policy, guided by the principles of optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility.
First, the Governing Council decided to end net asset purchases under the APP as of 1 July 2022. It said that it intended to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.
Second, the Governing Council concluded in June that the conditions under its forward guidance for starting to raise the key ECB interest rates had been satisfied. Accordingly, and in line with the previously signalled policy sequencing, it said that it intended to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at the July monetary policy meeting, with another increase expected in September.
Third, based on the assessment in June, the Governing Council anticipated that, beyond September, a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates would be appropriate, depending on the incoming data and the assessment of inflation developments over the medium term.
The decisions taken on 9 June reflected significant steps towards a normalisation of the monetary policy stance. At an ad hoc meeting on 15 June, the Governing Council assessed the financial market situation and potential fragmentation risks, and underscored its determination to preserve an orderly transmission of the monetary policy stance throughout the euro area. In particular, the Governing Council assessed that the pandemic had left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy, which were contributing to an uneven transmission of the normalisation of the ECB’s monetary policy across jurisdictions.
On the basis of this assessment, the Governing Council decided to apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In addition, it mandated the relevant Eurosystem committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument.
The new Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) was approved by the Governing Council at its meeting on 21 July. The Governing Council considered the establishment of the new instrument necessary to support the effective transmission of monetary policy, in particular over the course of policy normalisation. The TPI would ensure that the monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. The TPI constitutes an addition to the ECB’s toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. Subject to established criteria being met, the Eurosystem can make secondary market purchases of securities issued in jurisdictions experiencing a deterioration in financing conditions not warranted by country-specific fundamentals, to counter risks to the transmission mechanism to the extent necessary. The scale of TPI purchases, if activated, would depend on the severity of the risks facing monetary policy transmission; purchases would not be restricted ex ante. The Governing Council further emphasised in July that, in any event, the flexibility in reinvestments of redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio remained the first line of defence to counter risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. The Governing Council also highlighted in July that it retained discretion to conduct Outright Monetary Transactions for countries that fulfilled the requisite criteria. While the TPI’s objective is to safeguard the smooth transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, Outright Monetary Transactions can be activated in the event of severe distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro.
The Governing Council also decided in July on the first policy rate hike since 2011, raising the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. It judged that it was appropriate to take a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than had been signalled at its previous meeting. This decision was based on the Governing Council’s updated assessment of inflation risks and the reinforced support provided by the TPI for the effective transmission of monetary policy. The Governing Council also signalled that further normalisation of interest rates would be appropriate in the following months.
The frontloading of the exit from negative interest rates in July allowed the Governing Council to make a transition from forward guidance on interest rates to a meeting-by-meeting approach to its interest rate decisions. This transition appeared warranted in view of the exceptional uncertainty surrounding the outlook for inflation and the economy.
In September the Governing Council decided to raise the key ECB interest rates by another 75 basis points, the largest single increase in these rates on record up to then. It took this decision because inflation remained far too high and incoming data indicated that it would stay above target for an extended period. Soaring energy and food prices, demand pressures in some sectors owing to the reopening of the economy, and supply bottlenecks were still driving up inflation, which had risen to 9.1% in August. As in previous months, price pressures were continuing to strengthen and broaden across the economy. ECB staff had significantly revised up their inflation projections in September in comparison with the June projections, with HICP inflation declining over the projection horizon but still above the 2% target in the final year. Furthermore, incoming data pointed to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, and the economy was expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first quarter of 2023. Very high energy prices continued to reduce the purchasing power of people’s incomes and supply bottlenecks were still constraining economic activity. In addition, the geopolitical situation, especially Russia’s war in Ukraine, weighed on the confidence of businesses and consumers. Against this backdrop, the September staff projections for economic growth were revised down markedly for the remainder of 2022 and throughout 2023.
The increase in the key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points in September frontloaded the transition from a highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that would ensure the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target. The Governing Council said that, based on its assessment, it expected to raise interest rates further over the coming meetings to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Furthermore, since the deposit facility rate had been raised to above zero, the two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves was no longer necessary. The Governing Council therefore decided to suspend the two-tier system by setting the multiplier to zero. In addition, to preserve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and safeguard orderly market functioning, the Governing Council decided to temporarily remove the 0% interest rate ceiling for the remuneration of government deposits. The ceiling was temporarily set at the lower of either the deposit facility rate or the euro short-term rate (€STR), including under a positive deposit facility rate. The measure was intended to remain in effect until 30 April 2023 and was designed to prevent an abrupt outflow of deposits into the market, at a time when some segments of the euro area repo markets were showing signs of collateral scarcity, and to allow an in-depth assessment of how money markets were adjusting to the return to positive interest rates.
Inflation rose to 9.9% in September and 10.6% in October, the highest reading in the history of the single currency. Soaring energy and food prices, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand had led to a further broadening of price pressures and an increase in inflation over summer. Against this background, the Governing Council decided in October to raise the three key ECB interest rates again by 75 basis points, emphasising that with this third major policy rate increase in a row substantial progress had been made in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation.
The Governing Council also decided in October to change the terms and conditions of TLTRO III. It adjusted the interest rates on the operations from 23 November, by indexing the interest rate paid to the average applicable key ECB interest rates, and offered banks three additional voluntary early repayment dates. During the acute phase of the pandemic, this instrument played a key role in countering downside risks to price stability. In view of the unexpected and extraordinary rise in inflation, however, it needed to be recalibrated to ensure consistency with the broader monetary policy normalisation process and to reinforce the transmission of policy rate increases to bank lending conditions. The Governing Council expected the recalibration of the TLTRO III terms and conditions to contribute to the normalisation of bank funding costs. The ensuing normalisation of financing conditions would, in turn, exert downward pressure on inflation, helping to restore price stability over the medium term. The recalibration also removed deterrents to voluntary early repayment of outstanding TLTRO III funds. Voluntary early repayments would reduce the Eurosystem balance sheet and thus contribute to the overall monetary policy normalisation. The recalibration of TLTRO III and the subsequent repayments led to a substantial decline in excess liquidity.
Finally, in order to align the remuneration of minimum reserves held by credit institutions with the Eurosystem more closely with money market conditions, the Governing Council decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the deposit facility rate.
In December the Governing Council raised interest rates for the fourth time in a row, this time by 50 basis points, because inflation remained far too high and was projected to stay above the ECB’s target for too long. The Governing Council also said that interest rates would still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that were sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the target. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels would over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Inflation was 10.1% in November, slightly lower than the 10.6% recorded in October. The decline resulted mainly from lower energy price inflation. Food price inflation and underlying price pressures across the economy had strengthened and were expected to persist for some time. Amid exceptional uncertainty, Eurosystem staff had significantly revised up their inflation projections in December, and saw average inflation reaching 8.4% in 2022 before decreasing to 6.3% in 2023, with inflation projected to decline markedly over the course of that year. Inflation was then seen falling further to an average of 3.4% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. The projections indicated that the euro area economy might contract around the turn of 2022/2023, owing to the energy crisis, high uncertainty, weakening global economic activity and tighter financing conditions. However, they saw a possible recession as likely to be relatively short-lived and shallow, while the growth outlook for 2023 had still been revised down significantly compared with the previous projections.
In December the Governing Council also discussed principles for reducing the APP securities holdings. It decided that from the beginning of March 2023 onwards the APP portfolio would decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem would not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline would amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of the second quarter of 2023 and its subsequent pace would be determined over time. The Governing Council also highlighted that by the end of 2023 the ECB would review its operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which would provide information regarding the endpoint of the balance sheet normalisation process.
2.2 Eurosystem balance sheet developments as monetary policy normalises
In the first half of 2022 the growth of the Eurosystem balance sheet slowed as net purchases under the APP and the PEPP were phased out. In the second half the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy contributed to a gradual reduction of the balance sheet. The balance sheet reached its historical high in June at €8.8 trillion before net asset purchases under the APP were concluded as of 1 July (Chart 2.2). By the end of the year it had declined to €8.0 trillion, mainly on account of TLTRO III operations maturing as well as sizeable early repayments, especially after the TLTRO III terms and conditions were changed to align them with the broader monetary policy normalisation process.
At the end of 2022 monetary policy-related assets on the Eurosystem balance sheet amounted to €6.3 trillion, a decline of €0.7 trillion compared with the end of 2021. Loans to euro area credit institutions accounted for 17% of total assets (down from 26% at the end of 2021) and assets purchased for monetary policy purposes represented 62% of total assets (up from 55% at the end of 2021). Other financial assets on the balance sheet consisted mainly of foreign currency and gold held by the Eurosystem and euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios.
On the liabilities side, the overall amount of credit institutions’ reserve holdings and recourse to the deposit facility decreased to €4.0 trillion at the end of 2022 (from €4.3 trillion at the end of 2021) and represented 50% of total liabilities (in line with the percentage at the end of 2021). Banknotes in circulation grew to €1.6 trillion (from €1.5 trillion at the end of 2021) and accounted for 20% of total liabilities (up from 18%).
TheAPPcomprises four asset purchase programmes: the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). The PEPP was introduced in 2020 in response to the pandemic. All asset categories that are eligible under the APP are also eligible under the PEPP; a waiver of the eligibility requirements has been granted for securities issued by the Hellenic Republic. The Eurosystem completed net purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022 and under the APP as of 1 July 2022, while it continued reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities under both programmes in full. Purchases continued to be conducted in a smooth manner and in line with the respective prevailing market conditions.
At the end of 2022 APP holdings amounted to €3.3 trillion (at amortised cost). The PSPP accounted for the bulk of these holdings, with €2.6 trillion or 79% of total APP holdings at the end of the year. Under the PSPP, the allocation of purchases to euro area jurisdictions was guided by theECB’s capital keyon a stock basis. In addition, some national central banks purchased securities issued by EU supranational institutions. The weighted average maturity of the PSPP holdings stood at 7.2 years at the end of 2022, with some variation across jurisdictions. The ABSPP accounted for less than 1% (€23 billion) of total APP holdings at year-end, the CBPP3 for 9% (€302 billion) and the CSPP for 11% (€344 billion). Of the private sector purchase programmes, the CSPP contributed the most to the growth in APP holdings in 2022, with €34 billion of net purchases. Corporate and covered bond purchases are guided by benchmarks which reflect the market capitalisation of all eligible outstanding corporate and covered bonds respectively. As of October 2022 climate change considerations were incorporated into the corporate sector benchmark – more details can be found in Section 11.5.[8]
At the end of 2022 PEPP holdings amounted to €1.7 trillion (at amortised cost). Covered bond holdings accounted for less than 1% (€6 billion) of the total, corporate sector holdings for 3% (€46 billion) and public sector holdings for 97% (€1,629 billion).
For the purchases of public sector securities under the PEPP, the benchmark allocation across jurisdictions is the ECB’s capital key on a stock basis. At the same time, purchases were conducted in a flexible manner, which led to fluctuations in the distribution of purchase flows over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. The weighted average maturity of the PEPP public sector securities holdings stood at 7.6 years at the end of 2022, with some differences across jurisdictions.
The Eurosystem reinvested the principal payments from maturing securities held in the APP and PEPP portfolios. Redemptions of private sector securities amounted to €77 billion in 2022, while redemptions of public sector securities under the PSPP and PEPP amounted to €446 billion. The assets purchased under the PSPP, CSPP, CBPP3 and PEPP continued to be made available forsecurities lendingto support bond and repo market liquidity. Owing to the increase in demand for securities amid collateral scarcity in repo markets, the Governing Council decided in November 2022 to increase the Eurosystem limit for securities lending against cash collateral to €250 billion.
At the end of 2022 the outstanding amount of Eurosystem refinancing operations was €1.3 trillion, representing a decline of €878 billion compared with the end of 2021. This change mainly reflects voluntary early repayments (€826 billion) and the maturing of operations (€54 billion) under the TLTRO III series. Of the early repayments, €744 billion occurred following the change in the TLTRO III terms and conditions which took effect on 23 November 2022. Additionally, the pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) had mostly matured by the end of 2022, with only €1 billion outstanding, compared with €3.4 billion at the end of 2021. The weighted average maturity of outstanding Eurosystem refinancing operations decreased from around 1.7 years at the end of 2021 to 0.9 years at the end of 2022.
In March 2022 the ECB announced thegradual phasing-out of pandemic-related collateral easing measures. These measures were a core element of the ECB’s monetary policy response to the pandemic, making it easier for banks to access Eurosystem credit operations and increasing the volume of eligible collateral. According to ECB staff estimates, roughly 10% of the total collateral mobilised at the end of February 2022 was attributable to the easing measures.[9]This contribution was predominantly driven by the temporary reduction in valuation haircuts across all asset classes by a fixed factor of 20% and the extensions to the additional credit claim (ACC) frameworks of some national central banks.
In the first step of the gradual phase-out, which started in July 2022, the temporary reduction in valuation haircuts was decreased from 20% to 10%. In addition, several measures with a more limited impact and scope were phased out. This included no longer maintaining the eligibility of certain downgraded marketable assets and issuers of these assets that had met the credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 and restoring the 2.5% limit on unsecured debt instruments, in a credit institution’s collateral pool, issued by any single other banking group.
Two further steps in the phase-out will be implemented in June 2023 and March 2024. As part of the second step, a revision of the valuation haircut schedule will take effect from 29 June 2023 and will include the complete phase-out of the temporary reduction in valuation haircuts; the revision of the schedule is described in greater detail in Section 2.3. The remaining pandemic collateral easing measures will, in principle, be phased out in the third step in March 2024, following a comprehensive review of the ACC frameworks. The waiver of the minimum rating requirement for marketable debt securities issued by the Hellenic Republic will continue to apply for at least as long as reinvestments in Greek government bonds under the PEPP continue.
The amount of eligible marketable assets increased by €759 billion in 2022, reaching a level of €17.1 trillion at the end of the year (Chart 2.3). Central government securities continued to be the largest asset class (€9.3 trillion). Other asset classes included corporate bonds (€1.9 trillion), covered bank bonds (€1.7 trillion) and unsecured bank bonds (€1.7 trillion). Regional government securities (€595 billion), asset-backed securities (€562 billion) and other marketable assets (€1.3 trillion) each accounted for a comparatively small fraction of the eligible assets universe.
Mobilised collateral decreased by €314 billion to €2.5 trillion at the end of 2022 (Chart 2.4). Credit claims (including ACCs), for which mobilised amounts stood at €881 billion, continued to represent the most important asset class used as collateral. Covered bank bonds (€640 billion), asset-backed securities (€392 billion) and central government securities (€330 billion) were also mobilised to a considerable extent. Unsecured bank bonds, regional government securities and corporate bonds were used to a lesser extent, accounting for €113 billion, €62 billion and €55 billion respectively.
2.3Financial risks in times of monetary policy normalisation
All monetary policy instruments involve financial risks, which the Eurosystem manages through specific risk management frameworks when pursuing its monetary policy objectives. When there are several ways to implement policy, the Eurosystem’s risk management function endeavours to attain risk efficiency: achieving the policy objectives with the lowest possible amount of risk for the Eurosystem.[10]
In 2022, in view of the gradual normalisation of monetary policy and in line with the climate change action plan set out by the Governing Council, the Eurosystem made changes to its risk management frameworks.The Governing Council decided to gradually phase out the collateral easing measures it had introduced in response to the pandemic and to restore pre-pandemic risk tolerance levels in the Eurosystem’s credit operations. It also introduced climate change considerations in the framework for purchases of corporate sector securities. Rising interest rates will reduce the Eurosystem’s profitability in the foreseeable future.
In 2022 the ECB carried out its regularreview of the risk control frameworkfor monetary policy credit operations, resulting in an updated haircut schedule. The outcome of the review will be implemented in June 2023 with the second step of the gradual phase-out of the collateral easing measures. The phase-out process is explained in Section 2.2. This approach will gradually restore the Eurosystem’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance levels for credit operations, while at the same time avoiding cliff effects as regards collateral availability.
The main changes in the haircut schedule can be summarised as follows: (i) EU bonds (debt instruments issued by the European Union) will be moved to haircut category I from haircut category II and thus treated in the same way as debt instruments issued by central governments; (ii) all legislative covered bonds and multi-cédulas will be in haircut category II, thus removing the distinction between jumbo and other covered bonds; (iii) haircuts will be the same for marketable debt instruments with both variable and fixed coupons; (iv) the longest residual maturity category (over ten years) will be split into three to better cover the risks of long-dated bonds; (v) the flat 5% theoretical valuation markdown will be replaced with a markdown that varies by maturity and its application will be extended to all theoretically valued marketable assets except those in haircut category I.
Overall, the complete phase-out of the temporary reduction in valuation haircuts, based on an updated haircut schedule, will ensure an adequate level of risk protection, improve the consistency of the framework and enhance the risk equivalence of assets, while ensuring collateral availability.
In 2022 asset purchases continued to be conducted for monetary policy purposes under the APP and PEPP, for which specific financial risk control frameworks are in place. These take into account the policy objectives of the programmes as well as the features and risk profiles of the different asset types purchased. The frameworks consist of eligibility criteria, credit risk assessments and due diligence procedures, pricing frameworks, benchmarks and limits. They apply to net asset purchases, the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing holdings, and the holdings for as long as they remain on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet. Table 2.1 summarises the current key elements of these frameworks, reflecting changes introduced in 2022.
As part of the policy response to the pandemic, the Eurosystem made substantial purchases of commercial paper under the PEPP. In view of the discontinuation of net asset purchases under the PEPP and the APP, future commercial paper purchases are generally expected to be limited. Any future commercial paper purchases will be focused on the APP and be conducted at backstop pricing levels.[11]
From October 2022 onwards the Eurosystem tilted its reinvestments of principal payments from maturing corporate sector securities towards issuers with a better climate performance. This measure is further explained in Section 11.5.[12]
The ECB increased its key interest rates several times in 2022 in response to the extraordinarily large shocks to the inflation outlook. The higher interest rates in turn affect the profits of the ECB and of the national central banks of the euro area countries and may even result in financial losses. This is due to the fact that, in the short and medium term, the cost of the liabilities on central bank balance sheets is more sensitive to interest rates than the income generated by their assets. Over time, the income earned on the Eurosystem’s assets is also expected to rise, which will improve profitability.
In previous years financial buffers have been built up that can be used to offset potential losses. If these buffers are fully utilised, any remaining losses can be recorded on the balance sheet and can be offset with future profits, without directly affecting the ability of the Eurosystem central banks to operate effectively.[13]
Financial stability conditions deteriorated in the euro area over the course of 2022 amid high inflation, tighter financial conditions and weaker growth prospects. Key vulnerabilities increased throughout the year. They included: i) debt sustainability concerns as regards some firms, households and sovereigns; ii) financial asset valuations that may not have reflected the more negative outlook for growth, inflation and financial conditions, iii) stretched property market valuations, iv) increased credit risk for banks, and v) credit and liquidity risk exposures among non-bank financial institutions. To address the risks arising from these vulnerabilities, macroprudential authorities gradually tightened capital-based and/or borrower-based policy measures. In addition, work continued on strengthening the regulatory framework for banks and the macroprudential approach as regards non-bank financial institutions to further increase the long-term resilience of the financial system.
3.1 The financial stability environment in 2022
Financial stability conditions deteriorated in the euro area over the course of 2022, reflecting high inflation, tighter financial conditions and weaker growth prospects. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered large rises in commodity and energy prices which, together with global supply chain pressures, fuelled inflationary pressures. This led major central banks to adjust their monetary policy stance, which contributed to tighter global financial conditions, greater financial market volatility and asset price corrections. Large-scale fiscal support at a time of rising government bond yields resulted in increased debt servicing costs, particularly for more indebted countries, while high inflation weighed on households’ real incomes and firms’ costs. As a result, while euro area banks benefited from higher interest rates, concerns rose over the quality of their assets. Non-bank financial institutions continued to face elevated credit and liquidity risk, although they took steps to reduce portfolio risk levels to some extent.
High inflation and a tightening of financial conditions weighed on the financial situation of sovereigns, firms and households in 2022. With already high debt levels stemming from the pandemic, euro area governments provided renewed sizeable fiscal support to attenuate the impact of higher energy prices and inflation. At the same time, government bond yields increased sharply, which revived concerns about fragmentation in euro area sovereign debt markets. These were mitigated to some extent by policy action such as the announcement of the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. In the corporate sector, higher energy and commodity prices posed challenges for, particularly, those energy-intensive sectors that were less able to pass on higher costs to customers, such as some utility and construction firms. Small and medium-sized enterprises benefited less than larger firms from the post-pandemic rebound in economic activity and remained particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic activity and higher borrowing costs. Households’ ability to service debt was weakened by the erosion of real disposable income and savings by high inflation, combined with higher interest rates, particularly in countries where household debt levels are higher. While property price growth remained strong in the euro area, there were signs that the real estate expansion of recent years could come to an end, as overvaluation estimates were elevated, rates on new mortgages rose and mortgage growth slowed. A turn in the real estate cycle may compound the vulnerabilities in euro area household incomes and financial situations.
Euro area financial markets saw large price falls in 2022, mainly reflecting the direct impact of higher interest rates. While these corrections were generally orderly, there was an unusually strong co-movement in prices across a wide range of asset classes, which complicated diversification strategies. However, in the second half of 2022 and especially after September, stock market indices diverged from bond market performance and increased across Europe, supported by rising banking indices. Activity in primary markets – including initial public share offerings and issuance of high-yield corporate bonds – fell significantly compared with the previous year. Despite the market corrections, the prices of some risky assets still appeared stretched and may not have fully reflected the more negative outlook for growth, inflation and financial conditions. In addition, large shifts in commodity prices and related margin requirements posed challenges to liquidity management for some participants in derivative markets.
Euro area bank profitability remained robust in 2022, underpinned by lower operating expenses, still low loan loss provisions and higher operating income thanks to wider margins and higher lending volumes. Despite a significant worsening of the economic outlook, the quality of euro area banks’ assets showed no signs of a broad-based deterioration, with the non-performing loan ratio falling further. However, trends in “underperforming” loans (Stage 2 of the three categories under the IFRS 9 international financial reporting standard) suggested some increase in credit risk. Higher interest rates could increase credit risks stemming from banks’ exposures to vulnerable sectors, which have grown in recent years, notably including residential real estate markets. On the liability side, bond funding costs rose markedly for banks during 2022, driven predominantly by expectations of monetary policy actions. In addition, rising rates on new deposits and maturing funds under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) started to translate into higher average funding costs for banks. These growing cyclical headwinds were compounded by longer-term challenges stemming from low cost-efficiency, limited revenue diversification and overcapacity in parts of the euro area banking sector.
Non-bank financial institutions’ overall exposures to credit risk remained high in 2022, which put them at risk of substantial credit losses in the event of a significant deterioration in corporate sector fundamentals, especially in energy-intensive industries. In addition to liquidity needs stemming from investor redemptions, insurance policy lapses and margin calls, the broad-based fall in financial asset prices was the main driver of a significant decline in the total value of assets in the non-bank financial sector. While the cash holdings of investment funds rose from early 2022, their holdings of liquid assets remained relatively low, making them likely to amplify a market correction via procyclical selling behaviour should an adverse scenario trigger large redemptions. Non-banks’ duration risk remained elevated too, exposing the sector to further bond portfolio revaluation losses. However, particularly the life insurance and pension fund sectors stand to benefit from the transition to a higher interest rate environment because of their structural negative duration gaps. That said, non-banks responded to rising yields and a worsening economic outlook by starting to reduce their holdings of lower-rated corporate and sovereign bonds, thereby lowering risk in their portfolios.
In addition to risks for individual sectors, climate change continued to pose risks to financial stability in the euro area in 2022. Euro area banks, funds and insurers need to manage the implications of the transition to a greener economy, including concentration risks associated with climate-related exposures. Furthermore, increasing cyber risks threatened the euro area financial system, underlining the need for financial institutions to invest continuously in cyber infrastructures and security and for authorities to increase monitoring.
3.2 Macroprudential policy measures to build up financial sector resilience to accumulated vulnerabilities
The ECB has the task of assessing macroprudential capital measures for banks planned by national authorities in countries participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the system of banking supervision in Europe. Importantly, the ECB has the power to apply more stringent capital measures if necessary.[14]This role was particularly important in 2022 owing to the macro-financial vulnerabilities that had built up in recent years, including during the pandemic.
Although the macroeconomic outlook and financial stability conditions deteriorated in the euro area during 2022, banks under European banking supervision remained in a good position to withstand the unfolding economic challenges. Regulatory advances and an active use of prudential policies had resulted in stronger bank balance sheets and capital positions. At the same time, accumulated vulnerabilities, related in particular to residential real estate developments but also, more broadly, to strong credit growth and increasing indebtedness in the non-financial private sector, posed medium-term risks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made the macro-financial situation more challenging, compounding these vulnerabilities and increasing the likelihood of risks materialising in the near term.
To address these medium-term risks, a significant number of the countries participating in European banking supervision decided to tighten capital-based macroprudential measures. By the end of 2022, 11 countries had announced an increase in the countercyclical capital buffer and three countries had introduced a (sectoral) systemic risk buffer or announced an increase.[15]The ECB exchanged views with the national authorities and assessed the measures. It did not object to the decisions, which were considered consistent with its own assessment of the need to preserve resilience in the banking sector. By the end of 2022 15 countries had also applied borrower-based macroprudential measures.
In November 2022 the Governing Council issued astatementhighlighting the role of macroprudential capital buffers in preserving and strengthening banking sector resilience in a challenging macro-financial environment.[16]Tightening capital buffers, even late in the economic or financial cycle, provided that procyclical effects are avoided, shields against accumulated vulnerabilities and helps make capital available when needed as the buffers can be released if adverse developments materialise. In turn, this boosts the capacity of banks to absorb losses while continuing to provide key financial services to the economy. The statement noted the existing capital headroom above regulatory requirements and highlighted the need to avoid procyclical effects from an excessive tightening of credit conditions, in particular by properly tailoring the macroprudential measures to the specific conditions in each country. It also referred to the importance of addressing financial stability risks in the non-bank financial sector from a systemic risk perspective. In December 2022 the Governing Council announced that it hadrevised the floor methodologyfor capital buffers applicable to other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs). The revised methodology will make systemically important banks more resilient and will apply from 1 January 2024.
The ECB continued to communicate its analysis and views on macroprudential policy topics in 2022. It expressed the view that, over the medium term, the resilience of the financial system would be reinforced by creating more macroprudential space through an increase in the amount of releasable buffers, and by enhancing the effectiveness of the existing countercyclical capital buffers.[17]In addition, the macroprudential policy chapters of theMayandNovember2022 issues of the ECB’s Financial Stability Review explained why it was important to strengthen banking system resilience in a timely manner, while adjusting the timing and pace of the prudential measures to heightened uncertainty and country-specific conditions.[18]Last but not least, with the accumulation of vulnerabilities in real estate markets over recent years duly receiving renewed attention, the ECB dedicated the October 2022 issue of itsMacroprudential Bulletinto analysing the interplay between real estate markets, financial stability and macroprudential policy.
In 2022 the ECB continued to provide analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) Secretariat.[19]Notably, the ECB co-chaired an ESRB drafting team responding to the European Commission’s call for advice on the review of the EU macroprudential framework.[20]The ECB also supported the ESRB’s work on: (i) a macroprudential strategy on the risks to financial stability stemming from cyber incidents;[21](ii) policy reforms aimed at increasing the resilience of money market funds;[22](iii) monitoring vulnerabilities related to non-bank financial intermediation;[23](iv) the measurement and modelling of climate-related risks to EU financial stability;[24]and (v) analysing vulnerabilities in the European Economic Area commercial real estate sector.[25]
In 2022 the ESRB issued several warnings and recommendations. In January and February it published recommendations on increasing the resilience of money market funds and on establishing a systemic cyber incident coordination framework[26]as well as five warnings and two recommendations on vulnerabilities in the residential real estate sector.[27]Amid increasing risks to financial stability, the ESRB published its first general warning in September 2022.[28]In addition, the ESRB issued a recommendation concerning vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate sector in December 2022.[29]
More detailed information on the ESRB can be found on itswebsiteand in itsAnnual Reports.
3.3 Microprudential activities to ensure the soundness of individual banks
Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the ECB conducted avulnerability analysiswhich confirmed the overall resilience of the euro area banking sector to the macroeconomic and financial consequences of the war. However, as a result of sanctions put in place, some banks left the market. In February the ECB assessed thatSberbankEurope AG and its two subsidiaries in the banking union, Sberbank d.d. in Croatia and Sberbank banka d.d. in Slovenia, were failing or likely to fail owing to a deterioration of their liquidity situation. Moreover, the ECB took decisions related toRCB Bankphasing out its banking operations.
In 2022 the ECB adjusted the focus of its targeted reviews and on-site inspections to the risks most directly affected by the war: energy-related exposures, interest rate risk in the banking book, real estate exposures and counterparty credit risk. These pockets of risk, as well as pronounced uncertainty over the macroeconomic outlook and persistent concerns about banks’ governance and internal risk controls, meant that banks’ overall scores did not improve in the 2022 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process despite better asset quality and profitability metrics. To account for possible impacts of the war and the normalisation of monetary policy, geopolitical and funding risks were included in the 2023-25 supervisory priorities.
The ECB also took decisive steps forward on its climate risk agenda. The first supervisoryclimate risk stress testassessed how prepared banks were to anticipate and manage financial and economic shocks stemming from climate risk. The results, published in July, showed that banks did not yet sufficiently incorporate climate risk into their stress-testing frameworks and internal models, despite some progress made since 2020. Moreover, in November the ECB published the results of the 2022thematic review on climate-related and environmental risks, which concluded that most banks still needed to improve their risk practices to meet the supervisory expectations set out in the ECBGuide on climate-related and environmental risks. Two reports compiling good practices observed in thereviewand in thestress testwere published in November and December.
As part of its continued effort to enhance transparency and accountability, on 28 September 2022 the ECB launched apublic consultationon itsdraft Guide on qualifying holding procedures. The ECB alsoclarified its policiesfor exercisingoptions and discretionswhen supervising banks, following a public consultation which ended on 30 August 2021. In June 2022 the ECB issued astatementon the methodology that would be used for exercising supervisory discretion regarding cross-border intra-banking union exposures in the assessment framework for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).
Three banks were sanctioned by the ECB in 2022.[30]
Finally, the ECB published two supervisoryMemoranda of Understanding(with theSingle Resolution BoardandCommissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsarespectively) which were reviewed in 2022. ECB Banking Supervision also pursued itsdesk-mapping reviewof the international banks that had decided to relocate business from London, following Brexit, to subsidiaries in the countries participating in European banking supervision, to ensure that all entities supervised by the SSM have prudentially sound risk management arrangements and a local presence which enables effective supervision and is commensurate with the risks they originate.
More detailed information on ECB Banking Supervision can be found on itswebsiteand in the2022 ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities.
3.4 The ECB’s contribution to European financial sector policy initiatives
Significant progress was made on the regulatory framework for the financial sector in 2022. At the same time, further work remains to be done on implementing the final Basel III reforms, completing the banking union, improving the macroprudential framework and tackling climate risk, as well as on regulating crypto-assets, capital markets and non-bank financial institutions.
The European Commission published its proposals for implementing the Basel III reforms in the EU on 27 October 2021. Since then, the ECB has actively supported the legislative process. In 2022 it published opinions on the proposed revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive.[31]It also communicated its views on the banking package on several occasions.[32]
The discussions on completing the banking union continued in 2022, with the active involvement of the ECB. As agreed by the Eurogroup in June, work will now focus on strengthening the crisis management framework for banks, and in July the ECB published acontribution to the European Commission’s targeted consultation on the evaluation of State aid rules for banks in difficulty.
The review of the macroprudential framework in the EU, aimed at ensuring that the relevant authorities can address systemic risks in a timely, consistent and comprehensive manner across jurisdictions, was another important workstream for the ECB in 2022. In itsresponse to the European Commission’s call for advice, the ECB identified a number of priority areas where legislative action was needed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the EU macroprudential toolkit.
As part of its overallclimate agenda, the ECB continuously monitored climate-related financial risks and contributed to European and international policy discussions. It published a report, jointly with the ESRB, that showedhow climate shocks can affect the financial system. The report assessed the scope for macroprudential policies as part of a broader policy response, to complement microprudential efforts to address the financial impact of climate change. On the microprudential side, the ECB conducted an assessment of banks’ disclosures and a thematic review of climate-related and environmental risks, as well as a climate stress test (see Section 3.3). Furthermore, the ECB participated in the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks, which publishedfrequently asked questionsclarifying how climate-related financial risks may be addressed through existing regulatory standards, as well asprinciplesfor the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks. At the EU level, the ECB contributed to the European Banking Authority’s analysis on the role of environmental risks in the prudential framework.
In 2022 the ECB continued to highlight the importance of advancing the capital markets union.[33]It published several opinions on legislative proposals, including on i) enhancingmarket transparency, ii) the establishment and functioning of theEuropean Single Access Point, iii)central securities depositoriesand iv) theAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. The ECB also reiterated the need to implement the European Commission’s 2020 capital markets union action plan in full and without delay, welcoming the legislative proposals published in December 2022. These proposals address structural impediments to EU capital market integration, such as national differences in insolvency rules. The proposals will also make it less burdensome for companies to list securities and raise capital on public exchanges and will strengthen the EU central clearing system. The ECB called for further progress on investor protection and harmonisation of taxation, for cross-border supervision of capital markets to be strengthened and for venture capital frameworks to be harmonised across the euro area to support equity and risk capital markets and make it easier to finance innovation.
The ECB continued to highlight the importance of addressing structural vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector and improving the relevant policy framework from a macroprudential perspective.Policy proposals to address liquidity mismatch in the money market fund sector were reviewed in the ECB’s Macroprudential Bulletin and the ECB also contributed to the economic rationale supporting theESRB recommendation on reforming money market funds, published in January 2022.[34]The ECB has continued to stress that the implementation of such reforms must not be delayed.As regards open-ended investment funds, the ECB contributed to the assessment by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) of the effectiveness of the FSB’s 2017 recommendations on the structural liquidity mismatch in such funds.[35]The FSB will now revise the recommendations to better address the mismatch.[36]
The ECB also actively contributed to the discussions on a regulatory framework for crypto-assets in international fora such as the FSB, the BCBS and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI).[37]Important progress was made on ensuring that all crypto-asset activities posing a risk to financial stability will become subject tocomprehensive, globally coordinated regulation, supervision and oversightand that there is a globally agreedprudential treatment of banks’ crypto-asset exposures.
The Eurosystem plays a central role in developing, operating and overseeing market infrastructure and arrangements that facilitate the safe and efficient flow of payments, securities and collateral across the euro area. It also acts as a catalyst for integration and innovation in the payments and securities market. In 2022 the Eurosystem reviewed and renewed existing market infrastructure, policies and strategies, and explored new technologies and a potential digital euro.
4.1 TARGET Services and innovation and integration of market infrastructure and payments
The Eurosystem’s TARGET Services consist of three settlement services: TARGET2, a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) for euro payment transactions supporting the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations, bank-to-bank transfers and commercial payments; TARGET2-Securities (T2S), a single multi-currency platform for securities settlement in Europe; and TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), which settles instant payments in central bank money.
Approximately 1,000 banks use TARGET2 to initiate transactions in euro, either on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers. Taking into account branches and subsidiaries, more than 41,000 banks worldwide can be reached via TARGET2. In 2022 TARGET2 processed on average 399,653 payments per day with an average daily value of €2.219 trillion. This was a 7% increase in the daily volume of payments compared with 2021. For the first time, TARGET2 processed more than 100 million payments per calendar year.
In 2022 TARGET2 achieved 100% technical availability. Furthermore, the Eurosystem largely implemented theaction planto address the TARGET Services incidents that occurred in 2020.[42]
To verify the high level of cybersecurity of TARGET2, a TIBER-EU[43]test was performed in 2022. TIBER-EU tests mimic the tactics, techniques and procedures of real-life cyber attackers, based on bespoke threat intelligence. Performing such tests contributes to a deeper understanding of the ability of TARGET2 to withstand cyberattacks.
Following the formal approval of Croatia’s accession to the euro area on 1 January 2023, preparatory testing and the required coordination activities with Hrvatska narodna banka and the Croatian financial community for the migration from the national RTGS system to TARGET2 were conducted throughout 2022.
In line with technological developments, new regulatory requirements and changing user demands, the Eurosystem has been working on implementing T2, a new RTGS system and central liquidity management function that optimises liquidity management across all TARGET Services. Thelaunch of T2, which was planned for November 2022, was rescheduled to March 2023.
The T2S platform connects 19 central securities depositories (CSDs) from 20 European markets, allowing securities settlement in euro and Danish kroner.In 2022 T2S processed an average of 707,879 transactions per day with an average daily value of €716.67 billion. In addition, theCroatian CSD (SKDD),theBulgarian CSD (CDAD) and theBulgarian National Bank Government Securities Settlement Systemsigned the T2S Framework Agreement in 2022 and are assessing suitable migration dates. Testing activities for onboarding new CSDs to T2S will continue in 2023.
Two major enhancements to T2S took place in 2022. First, the penalty mechanism functionality to support the CSDs in complying with their obligations under the Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) settlement discipline regime moved from the dry run phase into production. Second, thedeployment of release 6.0 of the T2S platformallowed for the adoption of components that will be shared across the TARGET Services (so-called common components) within T2S.
To support the rollout of instant payments in the euro area, the Eurosystem finalised the implementation of measures to ensurepan-European reachability via TIPS.As more banks and national communities joined TIPS, transaction volumes increased 17.1 times compared with 2021, peaking at 18.7 million transactions in December 2022 (compared with 1.6 million in December 2021). Given theEuropean Commission’s legislative proposalto oblige EU payment service providers that already offer credit transfers in euro to also offer their instant version within a defined period, it is expected that the rollout of instant payments in euro will accelerate further.
The multi-currency design of TIPS has been attracting interest from non-euro area central banks. In May 2022Sveriges Riksbank successfully completed the first phase of migration to TIPS, paving the way for the instant settlement of payments in Swedish kronor in TIPS. Danmarks Nationalbank will offer settlement in Danish kroner on TARGET Services including TIPS in the second quarter of 2025. Norges Bank has also expressed an interest in potentially joining TIPS with its respective national currency. A possible cross-currency functionality that would allow instant payments between currencies settled on the platform is being explored.
In addition to the three settlement services, the Eurosystem is developing a new TARGET Service, the Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS), which will be a unified system for managing the assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations for all euro area jurisdictions. Thelaunch of ECMSwas moved from November 2023 to April 2024 to mitigate the impact of the rescheduled launch of T2.
With regard to the payments domain, the Eurosystem continues to pursue the goals set out in itsretail payments strategy. This includes supporting a pan-European retail payment solution at the point of interaction (i.e. at the physical point of sale and in the mobile and e-commerce space, governed by European private sector entities), the full deployment of instant payments, and making improvements to cross-border payments. It also encompasses work on ensuring all Europeans have access to safe, efficient and convenient payments in view of the growing digitalisation of the economy. This work included publication of thereport on the stock-take of accessibility to retail payments in the EU. Its key findings indicate that, while growing digitalisation poses particular challenges for vulnerable individuals and groups, it also provides opportunities for improving accessibility through dedicated innovative solutions.
In parallel to promoting the Eurosystem retail payments strategy, the ECB supports work on developing innovative payment services, including at the level of the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB). In particular, the ERPB has been promoting progress in open banking, which enables third-party providers to access payment account-related data with the consent of banks’ customers, and to initiate payments via open application programming interfaces. This in turn allows third-party providers to offer convenient and attractive payment solutions. At the invitation of the ERPB, the European Payments Council (EPC) started work on a future SEPA Payment Account Access (SPAA) scheme setting out rules, practices and standards that will allow the exchange of payment accounts related data and facilitates the initiation of payment transactions of value-added services provided by banks to third-party providers. A first version of aSPAA scheme rulebookwas published by the EPC in November 2022.
Digital innovation is not only changing retail payment services but also wholesale financial transactions. Financial market stakeholders have been experimenting with new technologies, for example distributed ledger technologies (DLT), for a couple of years now. In order to better assess these technologies, on 23 March 2023 the EU launched apilot regime for market infrastructures based on DLT, which will last for three years and is renewable once. This regime allows investment service providers, market undertakings and CSDs to operate a multilateral trading facility, a settlement system or a trading and settlement system based on DLT technology. In the hypothetical scenario that financial markets were to widely adoptDLT or other new technologies for wholesale transactions, the needs of the users of the Eurosystem’s wholesale settlement services, notably TARGET2 and T2S, might also change. To reduce risks to the financial system by ensuring that central bank money would retain its role as the safest settlement asset for wholesale financial transactions, the Eurosystem is exploring ways of using new technology for providing central bank money for the settlement of wholesale financial transactions. Careful analysis by the Eurosystem of the potential implications for governance, settlement efficiency and liquidity management is critical, while not implying any policy direction.
In line with its goal to further European financial market integration, the Eurosystem’s Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) continued to report on the progress made by national markets towards compliance with the standards agreed under the Single Collateral management Rulebook for Europe (SCoRE) initiative. In theH2 2022 SCoREBoard report, the AMI-SeCo noted that, despite some delays in the progress by stakeholders, ensuring full compliance by the deadline was still feasible. In view of the rescheduling of the go-live of the Eurosystem’s ECMS to April 2024, the AMI-SeCo agreed to move forward the deadline for compliance with the SCoRE standards in order to align on the timing.
Furthermore, the AMI-SeCo continued to monitor and discuss progress and developments in the T2S harmonisation agenda andcorporate events compliance, including the industry standards on shareholder identification.In addition, the AMI-SeCo submitted responses to the European Commission and European Securities and Markets Authority public consultations onwithholding tax proceduresand on the implementation of the Shareholder Rights Directive 2.
4.2 Digital euro investigation phase
The investigation phase of thedigital euro projectwhich was launched in October 2021 is on track and expected to finish in the second half of 2023. By that time the Governing Council will have been presented with the findings of the investigation phase and advice on whether or not to move to a preparation phase, as well as a project plan for this subsequent phase. Any potential decision to move to the preparation phase does not in itself pre-empt a decision to issue.
The Eurosystem regularly reported on the progress of the digital euro investigation phase, publishing two progress reports inSeptemberandDecember. In 2022 the Eurosystem agreed upon themain use cases and many key design decisions for a digital euro, taking into account the aspects of privacy and regulatory requirements, as well as the need to provide online possibilities alongside offline options for payments with a digital euro. These decisions also reflect the important role of intermediaries as distributors of a digital euro and a scheme as the preferred distribution model. The decision was taken to start preparations for a digital euro rulebook, for which a rulebook manager was hired and acall for expressions of interest by market representatives to take part in the draftingwas issued. Work on the rulebook itself started in the first quarter of 2023.
As part of this project, the related digital europrototyping activitieswith Eurosystem national central banks and private companies progressed according to plan. Findings will be reported on in the first half of 2023 and applied as relevant in a future project phase.
To ensure the development of a digital euro that is attractive for all stakeholders, the project relies on frequent interactions with market participants and future users in different fora and formats. In 2022 this included the dedicated technical sessions of the ERPB, bilateral feedback sessions with major stakeholder groups, meetings of the digital euro Market Advisory Group, focus group exercises and civil society seminars. In parallel, the ECB collaborated closely with the European institutions that will decide on the necessary legal framework for a potential future issuance of a digital euro.
4.3 Oversight and the role of central bank of issue
To ensure the safe and efficient functioning of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and payments in the euro area, the Eurosystem sets out oversight objectives in regulations, standards, guidelines and recommendations, monitors their implementation, and promotes change where necessary. As central bank of issue for the euro, the Eurosystem is involved in cooperative oversight and supervision, as well as crisis management arrangements for FMIs with meaningful euro-denominated activities.
As regards systemically important payment systems (SIPS), the Eurosystem oversight function directly oversees TARGET2, EURO1, STEP2-T and the Mastercard Clearing Management System. A particular focus during 2022 was the Eurosystem’s T2-T2S consolidation project (see Section 4.1). The Eurosystem conducted a pre-assessment of the consolidated platform focused on major changes to TARGET2 and monitored the project to identify any potential risks for the successful go-live of the platform and its subsequent smooth operation. In addition, the Eurosystem conducted a comprehensive assessment of the Mastercard Clearing Management System against the SIPS Regulation and the Cyber Resilience Oversight Expectations. The evolution and operational resilience of pan-European instant payment systems such as TIPS and RT1 was also closely monitored.
With respect to payment instruments, work focused on the implementation of the Eurosystem’s oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA framework). Based on the outcome of a harmonised scoring exercise, the governance authorities of identified payment schemes were notified as to whether they will be overseen, monitored or exempted from oversight activities under the PISA framework. For payment arrangements, this process is close to finalisation. Furthermore, comprehensive assessments were launched for a first group of payment schemes.
As central bank of issue for the euro, the Eurosystem continued to be a member of the supervisory colleges for EU central counterparties under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). In this capacity, it assessed various proposals for the extension of services or major changes in risk management procedures and revised recovery plans prepared in line with the EU Regulation on Recovery and Resolution for Central Counterparties. In the context of the preparatory work on thereview of EMIR, the Eurosystem provided input to the March 2022 consultation by the European Commission.
The Eurosystem also monitored the impact of increased market volatility on central counterparties. The ECB conducted analytical work on volatility in the energy market to explore the impact of large margin calls on clearing participants. The findings supported the ECB’s contribution to EU and international policy work on reducing the risk and potential impact of sudden large margin calls.
With regard to securities settlement, the Eurosystem contributed as central bank of issue to the regular evaluation of CSDs under the CSDR. The Eurosystem also started preparations for contributing to the application ofRegulation (EU) No 2022/858on a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology.
In the field of T2S oversight, the Eurosystem finalised the first assessment of T2S against the Cyber Resilience Oversight Expectations in the first quarter of 2022. The Eurosystem also completed its assessment of the changes implemented in T2S in 2022 (see Section 4.1).
Cyber resilience of FMIs continues to be a key focus in both the operational area of TARGET Services (see Section 4.1) and oversight. In 2022 a review of the Eurosystem/ESCB oversight cyber resilience strategy for financial market infrastructures and some of its tools was launched, another round of the Cyber Resilience Survey concerning FMIs was concluded, while theEuro Cyber Resilience Boardworked on information-sharing (particularly in view of the Russian invasion of Ukraine), crisis coordination and third-party risk. Under the TIBER-EU framework, the TIBER-EU Knowledge Centre developedbest practices for purple teaming, a collaborative activity which takes place during a certain stage of a TIBER test.
Most euro liquidity lines to other central banks established or activated since 2020 remained in place in 2022 and new lines were established with Narodowy Bank Polski and the Andorran Financial Authority. The ECB continued to offer US dollar operations to euro area counterparties, thereby providing a backstop to market-based funding. No ECB interventions took place in the foreign exchange market.
The ECB remained responsible for the administration of various financial operations on behalf of the European Union and played a coordinating role in relation to the Eurosystem reserve management services framework.
The transmission of ECB policy rate changes to euro area money markets (Box 3) was complete and immediate in the short-term unsecured money market segment, while term unsecured rates increased only sluggishly. The pass-through of rate hikes to secured money markets was also largely smooth, although with some heterogeneity in the speed of adjustment across segments.
5.1 Developments in market operations
The Eurosystem’s swap and repo lines are monetary policy instruments that are used as stabilising tools in times of stress in global financial markets.
When the Eurosystem provides euro to non-euro area central banks, the liquidity lines address possible euro liquidity needs in non-euro area countries in the event of market dysfunctions. They therefore prevent spillover effects in euro area financial markets and economies via upward pressure on short-term money market rates or fire sales of assets that might adversely impact the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. The liquidity lines also prevent euro liquidity shortages from turning into financial stability risks.
When the ECB receives foreign currency from another central bank (for example US dollars from the Federal Reserve System) and provides euro as collateral, the foreign currency liquidity lines ensure the continuous provision of loans in foreign currency. This prevents abrupt deleveraging, extreme price movements and interruptions to the flow of credit resulting from tensions in international funding markets.
Most euro liquidity lines that have been established or activated since 2020 remained in place and were prolonged initially to 15 January 2023 and later to 15 January 2024, with the exception of the swap agreements with Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) and Hrvatska narodna banka, and the repo line with the National Bank of Serbia, which expired at the end of March 2022. New liquidity lines were established in 2022 with Narodowy Bank Polski and the Andorran Financial Authority. Table 5.1 shows the euro liquidity lines in operation as of 31 December 2022, whereby the Eurosystem could provide euro liquidity to foreign central banks. Drawings on the euro liquidity lines have been limited to quarter-ends.
The reciprocal swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China was extended for another three years to October 2025.
In 2022 the ECB continued to provide US dollar liquidity in coordination with the Federal Reserve System, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, usually at a maturity of seven days. The provision of US dollars in major jurisdictions helped ease pressure in global funding markets and continued to backstop private funding markets.
The ECB did not intervene in the foreign exchange market in 2022. Since the inception of the euro, the ECB has intervened in the foreign exchange market twice – in 2000 and 2011. Data on foreign exchange interventions are published on a quarterly basis with a delay of one quarter on theECB’s websiteand in the Statistical Data Warehouse. The information published in the quarterly table is also recapped on an annual basis in the ECB’s Annual Report (Table 5.2). If there were no foreign exchange interventions in the relevant quarter, this is explicitly stated.
The reporting framework covers foreign exchange interventions carried out by the ECB unilaterally and in coordination with other international authorities, as well as interventions “at the margins” within the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II).
5.2 Administration of EU borrowing and lending operations
The ECB is responsible for the administration of the borrowing and lending operations of the EU under the medium-term financial assistance (MTFA) facility[44], the European financial stabilisation mechanism (EFSM)[45], the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an Emergency (SURE)[46]and the Next Generation EU (NGEU)[47]programme. In 2022 the ECB also accepted the European Commission’s request to perform paying agent services, thereby extending the ECB’s current fiscal agent services. Preparations are ongoing to become operational in 2023.
In 2022 the ECB processed interest payments in relation to the loans under the MTFA. As at 31 December 2022 the total outstanding nominal amount under this facility was €200 million. In 2022 the ECB also processed various payments and interest payments in relation to the loans under the EFSM. As at 31 December 2022 the total outstanding amount under this mechanism was €46.3 billion. In 2022 the ECB processed disbursements of SURE loans to various EU Member States and related interest payments. As at 31 December 2022 the total outstanding amount under this mechanism was €98.4 billion. Finally, in 2022 the ECB processed the disbursements of NGEU loans and grants to various Member States.
The ECB is also responsible for the administration of payments arising in connection with operations under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)[48]and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)[49]. In 2022 the ECB processed various interest and fee payments in relation to one loan under the EFSF.
Finally, the ECB is responsible for processing all payments in relation to the loan facility agreement for Greece.[50]As at 31 December 2022 the total outstanding amount under this agreement was €44.8 billion.
5.3 Eurosystem Reserve Management Services
In 2022 a comprehensive set of financial services continued to be offered within the Eurosystem reserve management services (ERMS) framework established in 2005 for the management of customers’ euro-denominated reserve assets. A number of Eurosystem national central banks provide financial services within this framework ‒ under harmonised terms and conditions and in line with market standards ‒ to central banks, monetary authorities and government agencies located outside the euro area, as well as to international organisations. The ECB performs an overall coordinating role, monitors the smooth functioning of the services, promotes changes to improve the framework and prepares related reports for the ECB’s decision-making bodies.
The number of reported customer accounts in the ERMS stood at 270 at the end of 2022, compared with 265 at the end of 2021. The total aggregated holdings (including cash assets and securities holdings) managed within the ERMS framework decreased by approximately 6% in 2022 compared with 2021.
Euro banknote circulation continued to grow in 2022, by 4.5% in terms of number and 1.8% in terms of value, and was mainly affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the rises in the ECB’s key interest rates from July onwards.
The ECB study on payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area revealed that cash was the most frequently used payment method at points-of-sale, accounting for 59% of payments. Moreover, the first survey on the use of cash by companies concluded that 96% of companies serving mostly private customers accepted cash and more than 90% will continue to do so in the future.
Counterfeiting levels remain remarkably low. Development of new security features for banknotes continues with a view to keeping ahead of counterfeiters and further improving the resilience and integrity of the banknotes.
6.1 Circulation of euro banknotes
At the end of 2022 euro banknote circulation reached 29.5 billion pieces and a total value of €1.57 trillion. This represents positive annual growth rates of 4.5% and 1.8% in terms of the number and value of banknotes respectively. Two main developments affected the circulation of euro banknotes in 2022. First, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine generated higher demand for euro banknotes in February and March 2022, as people wanted to have enough funds in the event of possible disruptions to payment ecosystems. The demand for euro banknotes stabilised from April 2022 onwards. Second, the increase in the ECB’s key interest rates starting on 27 July 2022 made the outstanding euro cash holdings more expensive compared with interest-bearing instruments. As a result, a small part of euro banknotes in circulation returned to the Eurosystem, with a downward effect on euro banknote circulation (Chart 6.1).
To maintain the quality of euro banknotes in circulation and trust in them, Eurosystem national central banks processed 24.8 billion euro banknotes. Of this amount, 3.2 billion worn-out banknotes had to be replaced with newly printed banknotes.
The value of euro coin circulation also grew by 4.0% annually to reach €32.5 billion at the end of 2022. This represents a total of 145 billion euro coins in circulation.
The introduction of euro banknotes and coins in physical form as of 2002 was a milestone in European history. It was considered a remarkable event, including at a global level, as it represented – and still does – the world’s largest ever monetary changeover.
6.2 Studies on payment attitudes among consumers and use of cash by companies in the euro area
Between October 2021 and June 2022 the ECB conducted thestudy on payment attitudes of consumers in the euro areato assess consumers’ payment behaviour and preferences, as well as their access to various payment instruments. The study showed that cash was the most frequently used payment method at points-of-sale, with 59% of all payments made in cash, although the share of cash payments had declined from 72% in 2019. In terms of value, cards accounted for a higher share of payments (46%) than cash (42%). Cash was accepted in 95% of transactions in physical payment locations throughout the euro area, while it was possible to pay with non-cash instruments in 81% of transactions.
Most euro area consumers were satisfied with their access to cash. The vast majority of consumers (90%) found it fairly easy or very easy to get to an ATM or a bank.
In 2022 the ECB published the results of its first survey on the use of cash by companies, shedding light on companies’ strategic views on the current and future use and acceptance of cash. Cash is likely to remain relevant as a payment method, since more than 90% of firms currently accepting cash intend to continue to do so in the future. Security and reliability are the most important criteria for firms when deciding whether to accept a means of payment.
6.3 Low level of counterfeiting and euro banknote development
In the course of 2022, 376,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation. With 13 counterfeits detected per 1 million genuine banknotes in circulation, this is the second lowest level of counterfeits in proportion to banknotes in circulation since the introduction of euro banknotes (Chart 6.2). There was an increase of 8.4% in the total number of counterfeits withdrawn from circulation compared with 2021. This also reflects the rebound in economic activity in 2022 following the lifting of most pandemic-related restrictions. The quality of the counterfeits continues to be low. Consequently, they can be detected very quickly and easily on applying the “feel-look-tilt” test.
In order to ensure the high quality of euro banknotes and their resilience to counterfeiting in the future, the development of new security features continues, also taking into account benefits offered by technological advances. Other important objectives that have been set for future banknotes include the redesign of euro banknotes and reduction of their environmental impact. No decision on the actual production and issuance of new euro banknotes has yet been taken.
The ECB – assisted by the national central banks (NCBs) – develops, collects, compiles and disseminates a wide range of statistics and data needed to support the ECB’s monetary policy, as well as financial stability-related and other tasks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Systemic Risk Board. These statistics are also used by public authorities, international organisations, financial market participants, the media and the general public, and help the ECB to increase the transparency of its work.
In 2022 the ECB focused on new euro area statistics, namely the enhanced publication of securities statistics, the development of indicators for overnight index swaps (OIS) in the euro money market based on Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR) data, information on special purpose entities (SPEs) and bilateral external statistics of euro area countries vis-à-vis Russia. Experimental indicators to support climate change policy were developed and work started on the design phase of the Integrated Reporting Framework (IReF). Furthermore, new data on non-bank financial institutions were included in quarterly financial accounts.
7.1 New and enhanced euro area statistics and other developments
The ECB’s Governing Council adopted a new Guideline in the field of securities data and securities issues statistics.[51]The Guideline defines amended requirements for the data quality management of the ESCB’s Centralised Securities Database (CSDB) and new requirements to produce securities issues statistics based on CSDB data.
Following the adoption of the Guideline, the ECB started publishing new breakdowns for securities issues statistics by valuation method, maturity and interest rate type for all EU Member States. This is the first ESCB micro-to-macro dataset, whereby CSDB micro data are used to compile official macro statistics in line with international statistical standards. The data are available at a significantly enhanced timeliness. The ECB also significantly extended the publication of securities holdings statistics with new breakdowns by individual euro area country, as well as by holder and issuer sectors. The new data provide a more timely and complete picture of the financial markets, allowing better monitoring of primary and secondary market activities.
The ECB started publishing new statistics on the OIS in the euro money market based on MMSR data collected from 47 euro area banks.[52]The data series include information on the OIS spot and forward markets about the total and daily average nominal amount and the weighted average rate. The new statistics complement data on the unsecured and secured money market segments, which have been published regularly since November 2017 and January 2019 respectively. The publication of the new statistics serves to enhance market transparency and therefore improve money market functioning.
In May 2022 the ECB’s Governing Council adopted the amendment to the Guideline on external statistics to collect statistical information on SPEs.[53]This will allow a better understanding of their role in the economic and financial system of the euro area. The first transmission of data relating to cross-border transactions and stocks of resident SPEs started in March 2023 based on data for the fourth quarter of 2022, while back data from the first quarter of 2020 will be transmitted by September 2023.
In October 2022 the ECB started publishing a subset of bilateral external statistics of euro area’s countries vis-à-vis Russia.[54]This additional granularity at quarterly frequency provides useful statistical detail for the topical analysis of cross-border transactions and positions between euro area countries and Russia.
7.2Development of experimental indicators to support climate change policy
Based on work completed in 2022, on 24 January 2023 the ECB published for the first time three sets of new statistical indicators on sustainable finance, greenhouse gas emissions and physical risk. This work is part of the ECB action plan[55]to include climate change considerations in its monetary policy strategy. The development of these indicators on climate change was highly complex. The indicators consist of, among other things, matching various cross-country micro-level datasets, developing appropriate imputation mechanisms for missing data, and inspecting data quality considering aspects such as confidentiality, replicability and representativeness. As such, and with differences dependent on the subset of data in question, the datasets remain a “work in progress” with some caveats hampering the use of these indicators.
The following three datasets were released:[56]
In line with the action plan set out by the ECB’s Governing Council, improvements in these three datasets are being worked on, partially supported by new and better data sources as they emerge, as well as by any future methodological developments both within the ESCB and worldwide.
7.3 Progress on the Integrated Reporting Framework
The ECB’s long-standing commitment to reduce the reporting burden of banks and improve the quality and comparability of data took shape in 2022. In December 2021 the design phase of the IReF programme was launched with the aim of integrating the Eurosystem’s statistical requirements for banks into a single standardised framework that will be applicable across the euro area and that might also be adopted by authorities in other EU Member States.[57]
During the design phase, the Eurosystem is identifying the key elements of the new framework (both in terms of content and data processes) and outlining a more efficient organisation of the Eurosystem statistical business process. In shaping the IReF, the Eurosystem builds on the contributions of the relevant stakeholders by means of an ongoing cost-benefit assessment.[58]As part of the ongoing cost-benefit assessment, three reports were published in September 2022. These were each focused on specific features of the envisaged reporting system, namely content-related topics, technical integration of country-specific requirements, and procedural and implementation aspects.[59]Furthermore, the ECB organised two workshops with the banking industry in 2022 to discuss the state of play of the cost-benefit assessment.
The IReF is a first step towards a broader initiative for an integrated reporting system for statistical, prudential and resolution data in the EU, as requested by the European banking industry and solicited by the European Parliament and the Council. The European Banking Authority (EBA), ECB, Single Resolution Board (SRB) and the European Commission have started cooperating in an Informal Coordination Group to further such integration. The cooperation among authorities is expected to be formalised through the creation of a Joint Bank Reporting Committee (JBRC) ‒ involving the ESCB, the EBA, Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and non-SSM national competent authorities, the SRB, national resolution authorities and the European Commission, as outlined in the EBA feasibility study published in December 2021.[60]
In 2022 ECB research focused on assessing inflation developments and analysing the potential impacts of monetary policy normalisation. The use of datasets available via the Household Finance and Consumption Network (HFCN) was extended to the analysis of heterogeneities in household finances across the euro area. New projects have been initiated based on the rich information collected via the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey (CES). Research on climate change-related issues also intensified. Collaboration with national central banks within the research clusters of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) continued, with annual workshops organised to discuss the most pressing issues in their respective fields of specialisation. The Price-setting Microdata Analysis (PRISMA) network concluded its work and delivered several policy-relevant findings (see Box 5).
8.1 Update on ECB research initiatives
In 2022 a main focus of the ECB’s research was to examine the effects of interest rate and balance sheet normalisation, including the transmission channels and trade-offs involved. A wide array of in-house models with macro-financial linkages were used to assess the potential impact of normalisation on financial stability. A key and persistent insight from most of this research is that policy normalisation mitigates the build-up of financial vulnerabilities and lowers tail risks to inflation over the medium term, at the cost of tighter financing conditions and greater downside risks to growth in the short term.
The HFCN has served as a key input for constructing the euro area distributional wealth accounts and is an important source of information for several research projects conducted by the ECB’s Research Taskforce on Heterogeneity.
Research based on HFCN data focused on the difference in wealth and liquid assets between non-immigrant and immigrant households in the euro area, financial distress of households, substantial differences in housing and home ownership rates across euro area countries, and the heterogeneity of the effects of the pandemic on household finances.
The ECB’s CES gained increasing visibility over the course of 2022. This was evidenced by the development of new survey modules on consumer finance, housing, labour markets and other central banking-related topics, as well as the expansion of research output and new projects drawing on the rich array of topics covered by the survey. Work based on the CES has featured prominently in the ECB’s economic, monetary and financial analysis, as well as in its official publications. As highlighted on the newly developedCES web page, publications featuring the survey data have led to insights on a variety of topics including inflation expectations, central bank communication, consumption and consumer finance, monetary policy transmission to households, the energy shock, and fiscal support to households. In addition, the aggregate results from the monthly surveys are now reported regularly on the CES web page. A monthly press release initiated in August 2022 summarises consumers’ expectations about inflation, the housing market, access to credit, income, consumption, the labour market, and economic growth.
Research on climate change intensified in the course of 2022. Researchers focused on various aspects of the interaction between financial stability, financial markets, government policy and the green transition. A number of ECB research papers were published on various aspects of this topic and drew the following policy-relevant conclusions: (i) bank lending responds to climate policy, with visible reallocation of fossil fuel lending across national borders in response to carbon taxes[62]and a significant decline in lending to greenhouse gas-intensive companies following the Paris Agreement[63]; (ii) more equity-based economies decarbonise faster than more debt-based economies[64]; (iii) natural-resource scarcity prompts energy-saving technical change[65]; and (iv) it is considerably costlier for society to set carbon taxes at lower-than-optimal rather than higher-than-optimal levels[66].
Another strand of research studied how climate-related risk and financial stability are connected and considered three main dimensions: 1) data on and measurement of climate-related risks for the financial system, 2) stress test assessments of climate-related risks, and 3) macroprudential policy implications of climate-related risks. The findings were published in a jointECB/ESRB reportin July 2022.
8.2 Update on the work of ESCB research clusters
Regular research networks continued coordinating research efforts within the ESCB and maintaining relations with academic researchers. In particular, the ESCB research clusters on “Monetary economics” (Cluster 1), “International macroeconomics, fiscal policy, labour economics, competitiveness and EMU governance” (Cluster 2), “Financial stability, macroprudential regulation and microprudential supervision” (Cluster 3) and “Climate change” (Cluster 4) held workshops on the most pressing issues in their fields.
The annual workshop of Cluster 1 took place in Paris on 10-11 October 2022. Organised by the Banque de France, it focused on the themes of inflation, interest rates, and monetary and fiscal policy interactions. Cluster 2 held its annual workshop at the Bank of Greece on 29-30 September 2022. It focused on the implications of economic sanctions, in particular their effects on trade, employment and production. Members also discussed the interactions between monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the design of EU institutions in the light of the threat of disintegration. The annual workshop of Cluster 3, hosted by the Banco de Portugal, took place in Lisbon on 20-21 October 2022. It covered topics ranging from banking regulation and supervision to housing markets and central bank digital currencies. On 5-6 September 2022 Cluster 4 held its first annual workshop virtually, hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank. The workshop dealt with theoretical and empirical research on the macroeconomic effects of climate change and climate policy, as well as the implications for various financial markets.
In 2022 the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “Court of Justice”) interpreted for the first time the concept of “other type of credit facility” in the context of the monetary financing prohibition and recognised the financial independence of national central banks (Case C-45/21). The Court of Justice also put an end to almost ten years of litigation relating to the 2013 resolution measures in Cyprus (Cases T-200/18 and T-379/16) and further clarified important aspects of the ECB’s supervisory powers (Case T-275/19). The ECB adopted 14 opinions on proposed Union acts and 32 opinions on draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence. Five cases of non-compliance with the obligation to consult the ECB on draft legislation were recorded in respect of national laws. The ECB’s 2022 monitoring exercise on central banks’ compliance with the prohibitions on monetary financing and privileged access confirmed that Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty were in general respected.
9.1 Jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning the ECB
In September 2022 the Court of Justice of the European Union, sitting in Grand Chamber, ruled for the first time on the interpretation of the term “other type of credit facility” used in Article 123(1) of theTreaty on the Functioning of the European Unionand defined in Article 1(1)(b)(ii) ofCouncil Regulation (EC) No 3603/93as “any financing of the public sector’s obligations vis-à-vis third parties” (Case C-45/21). According to the Court of Justice, the prohibition of a credit facility within the meaning of any financing of the public sector’s obligation vis-à-vis third parties not only means that the national central banks (NCBs) must not assume pre-existing obligations of other public authorities or bodies vis-à-vis third parties; it also requires that the effective financing of the obligations vis-à-vis third parties by the NCBs must not result directly from the measures adopted by, or from the policy choices made by, other public authorities or bodies. In the same preliminary ruling, the Court of Justice expressly recognised, again for the first time, the financial dimension of the NCBs’ independence and interpreted its implications in the context of an NCB performing national tasks outside the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). According to the Court of Justice, NCBs’ ability to carry out independently a task falling within the scope of the ESCB would be undermined if national tasks falling outside that scope precluded NCBs from building up adequate financial resources in the form of reserves or buffers to offset losses, particularly those resulting from monetary policy operations.
In July and November 2022, respectively the General Court dismissed the last pending actions for damages brought against, amongst others, the ECB by some stakeholders in two Cypriot banks which were subject to the 2013 resolution measures (Cases T-200/18 and T-379/16). The orders follow the 2020 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the joinedChrysostomidesandBourdouvalicases[67]that concerned similar subject matter. The applicants alleged that the relevant resolution measures were imposed by the ECB and other defendants[68]through, among other things, their involvement in the Eurogroup meetings, their role in the negotiation and adoption of the Cypriot Memorandum of Understanding, and the ECB Governing Council decisions relating to the emergency liquidity assistance. The General Court found that the ECB and other defendants did not commit any breach of the right to property, the principle of legitimate expectations, the principle of proportionality or the principle of equal treatment. The orders delivered by the General Court put an end to almost ten years of litigation relating to the 2013 resolution measures in Cyprus and in which the ECB has always prevailed by demonstrating that it acted lawfully.
In December 2022 the General Court delivered four judgments, dismissing all actions brought by AS PNB Banka against a series of ECB supervisory decisions and further clarifying the ECB’s supervisory powers. From January 2019 to February 2020 the ECB adopted a series of supervisory decisions regarding AS PNB Banka. Reviewing these decisions, the General Court confirmed that the ECB is competent to exercise, with regard to a less significant credit institution, all investigatory powers listed in Articles 10 to 13 of theSSM Regulation, including on-site inspections, and clarified that applicable regulation does not require the inspected entity to be heard before the adoption of the decision to perform an on-site inspection (Case T-275/19). The General Court also confirmed that the ECB enjoys broad discretion to activate the power to take over direct supervision of a less significant institution when necessary to ensure consistent application of high supervisory standards (Case T-301/19). Third, the General Court ruled that the ECB may oppose a proposed acquisition of a qualifying holding if there are reasonable grounds for doing so on the basis of one or more of the criteria referred to in Article 23(1) of Directive 2013/36, without being required to examine the other criteria (Case T-330/19). Lastly, having regard to the withdrawal decision, the General Court clarified some aspects relating to the relations between a proposal by a national competent authority (NCA) and the ECB’s final decision on withdrawal. For example, it ruled that, since it is not bound by the NCA proposal, the ECB shall perform its own assessment, taking into account the elements listed in Article 83(2) of the SSM Framework Regulation. As a result, the ECB may, if appropriate, add in the final withdrawal decision grounds for withdrawal which were not included in the NCA proposal (Case T-230/20).
9.2 ECB opinions and cases of non-compliance
Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union require that the ECB be consulted on any proposed EU or draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence. All ECB opinions are published onEUR-Lex. ECB opinions on proposed EU legislation are also published in the Official Journal of the European Union. In 2022 the ECB adopted 14 opinions on proposed Union legal acts and 32 opinions on draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence.
Five cases of non-compliance with the obligation to consult the ECB on draft legislation were recorded in respect of national laws and Union legal acts. The first case concerned a Finnish law on an emergency interbank payment scheme. This case was considered to be clear and important owing to its potential impact on the ESCB’s task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems and on the tasks of Suomen Pankki. The second case concerned an Italian law on measures prohibiting the financing of companies producing anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions and submunitions, which required the relevant authorities, including Banca d’Italia, to ensure that credit institutions comply with the ban on financing companies that produce anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions and submunitions.This case was considered to be clear and important owing to its potential impact on Banca d’Italia due to the atypical nature of the task for a national central bank. The third case concerned the Irish Land Development Agency Act, which makes provision for the compulsory acquisition of lands owned by relevant public bodies, including the Central Bank of Ireland. This case was considered to be clear and important owing to its potential impact on the Central Bank of Ireland, in particular on its financial independence. The fourth case concerned a Lithuanian law on securitisation and covered bonds amending the Law on Lietuvos bankas that designated Lietuvos bankas as the competent authority responsible for the public supervision of securitisation and covered bonds and conferred on it the related supervisory, investigatory and sanctioning powers. This case was considered to be a clear and important case owing to its impact on the tasks of Lietuvos bankas. The fifth case concerned the Union Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union. This case was considered to be a clear and important case of failure to consult the ECB because of its potential impact on the ESCB’s tasks, in particular the promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems, the contribution to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by competent authorities relating to the stability of the financial market system and the ECB’s tasks concerning the prudential supervision of credit institutions.
The ECB adopted 14 opinions on EU legislative proposals, covering topicssuch as the introduction of the euro in Croatia and the conversion rate to euro for the Croatian kuna; the introduction of a gas price market correction mechanism; CSDs; prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms as regards requirements for credit risks and with respect to resolution (CRR III); supervisory powers, sanctions, third-country branches, and environmental, social and governance risk (CRD VI); the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing (AMLD 6), and the establishment of an Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism; ensuring a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS 2); markets in financial instruments (MiFIR/MiFID II); alternative investment fund managers; harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data (Data Act); the establishment and functioning of a European Single Access Point providing centralised access to publicly available information relevant to financial services, capital markets and sustainability; and the system of national and regional accounts in the European Union.
With regard to national legislation, which often covers more than one subject, the ECB adopted eight opinions concerning currency matters and means of payment; 25 opinions concerning NCBs; two opinions concerning payment and/or securities settlement systems; four opinions concerning statistical matters; five opinions concerning the stability of the financial system; two opinions concerning monetary policy instruments and operations; and seven opinions concerning the prudential supervision of credit institutions.
9.3 Compliance with the prohibition of monetary financing and privileged access
Pursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the compliance of the EU NCBs with the prohibitions laid down in Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty and Council Regulations (EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 123 prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from providing overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility to governments and EU institutions or bodies, as well as from purchasing in the primary market debt instruments issued by these institutions. Article 124 prohibits any measure, not based on prudential considerations, which establishes privileged access by governments and EU institutions or bodies to financial institutions. In parallel with the Governing Council of the ECB, the European Commission monitors Member States’ compliance with the above provisions.
The ECB also monitors the EU central banks’ secondary market purchases of debt instruments issued by the domestic public sector, the public sector of other Member States and EU institutions and bodies. According to the recitals of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the acquisition of public sector debt instruments in the secondary market must not be used to circumvent the objective of Article 123 of the Treaty. Such purchases should not become a form of indirect monetary financing of the public sector.
The ECB’s monitoring exercise conducted for 2022 confirmed that Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty were in general respected.
The ECB will continue monitoring the involvement of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in the Budapest Stock Exchange as the purchase of the majority ownership of the Budapest Stock Exchange by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in 2015 may still be seen as giving rise to monetary financing concerns.
The Central Bank of Ireland’s reduction of assets related to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation during 2022 through sales of long-duration floating rate notes is a step towards the necessary full disposal of these assets and raises the prospect of fully dissolving the Special Portfolio in 2023. Continued sales at an appropriate pace would further mitigate the serious monetary financing concerns that persist.
The financing by NCBs of obligations falling upon the public sector vis-à-vis the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is not considered as monetary financing provided it results in foreign claims that have all characteristics of reserve assets. However, financial donations as provided in 2022 and previous years by a few NCBs via the IMF for debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries did not result in any foreign claims.This form of financial contributions by NCBs to IMF initiatives is therefore not compatible with the prohibition of monetary financing and warrants corrective measures where not yet fully implemented (Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique, Banque de France, Banca d’Italia, Lietuvos bankas and Sveriges Riksbank).
The ECB continued to interact closely with its European and international partners in 2022. The ECB’s relationship with the European Parliament is an essential part of its accountability framework. Throughout the year, the ECB engaged in regular hearings and exchanges of letters with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament (ECON). It held additional meetings with ECON as part of its ongoing work on a digital euro. At international level, the ECB engaged constructively in a challenging dialogue with G20 finance ministries and central banks. It also contributed to central bank-relevant discussions at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), focusing on policy responses to alleviate the consequences on IMF members of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The ECB also interacted closely with the IMF on the operationalisation of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust to facilitate the voluntary channelling of special drawing rights (SDRs) following the landmark general allocation of SDRs in 2021 in line with the governance framework of Economic and Monetary Union. The ECB, often together with its partners in the European System of Central Banks, also continued its international engagement beyond the G20 and the IMF in other fora, including through central bank cooperation with Ukraine, and with other prospective EU Member States and developing and emerging countries.
10.1 The ECB’s accountability
The ECB was granted independence under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), meaning that it is not subject to instructions from Union institutions, any national government or other bodies. This ensures that the ECB can make decisions in pursuit of its objective to maintain price stability without being influenced by political actors. The necessary counterpart to independence is accountability. The ECB is accountable for its actions to the European Parliament as the body composed of the elected representatives of the EU’s citizens. The effective discharge of the ECB’s accountability obligations to the European Parliament is an essential part of its work. The two-way dialogue between the ECB and the European Parliament allows the ECB to explain its actions and policies to the representatives of EU citizens and to listen to their concerns. This dialogue has evolved over time, going beyond the requirements set out in Article 284(3) of the TFEU. Additionally, the actions of the ECB are subject to judicial review by the Court of Justice of the European Union, providing an additional layer of accountability.
In 2022 the President of the ECB attended four regular hearings of the ECON Committee and participated in theplenary debateon the ECB’s 2020 Annual Report in February. During the regular hearings, the President of the ECB answered more than 120 questions from Members of the European Parliament covering a wide range of topics. A majority of the questions focused on the ECB’s monetary policy and the economic outlook (75%), but Members also raised issues related to economic governance (9%), climate change (6%) and financial legislation (4%). The ECB Vice-President alsopresented the ECB’s 2021 Annual Reportto the ECON Committee in April 2022. On the same occasion, the ECB published itsfeedbackon the input provided by the European Parliament as part of the latter’s resolution on the 2020 Annual Report. Moreover, in May 2022 a delegation of Members of the ECON Committee participated in the annual visit to the ECB, which took place in person following two years of virtual visits during the pandemic. In addition to these direct interactions, the ECB alsorepliedto 32 written questions from Members of the European Parliament over the course of the year.
Furthermore, the ECB interacted closely with the ECON Committee in the context of its work on a digital euro.[69]In 2022 Executive Board Member Mr Panetta attended three hearings of the ECON Committee to discuss progress made during the digital euro investigation phase, including the topics of privacy, financial stability and the role of the private sector in a digital euro ecosystem. The ECB also organised staff-level technical seminars with the European Parliament and participated in events organised by Members of the European Parliament to discuss a digital euro.
The Winter 2022-23Eurobarometer surveyconducted in January and February 2023 indicated that 79% of euro area respondents supported the euro. While these results are encouraging, the same survey also showed that a relatively smaller share of 44% tended to trust the ECB. It is essential for the ECB to foster public trust both to anchor inflation expectations and to shield the ECB from political pressures that could undermine its independence. The ECB will therefore continue its efforts to build trust among the public by engaging in constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and euro area citizens to explain its decisions and listen to their concerns.
10.2 International relations
Global economic developments during Indonesia’s G20 Presidency in 2022 were dominated by the severe economic and humanitarian impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine, which exacerbated global fragilities and slowed the nascent global recovery. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors had to respond to the direct and indirect impacts of the war, such as food and energy shortages, rising global inflation and increasing debt problems, in particular in vulnerable countries. Moreover, long-term structural challenges, such as mitigating climate change, improving pandemic preparedness, and avoiding protectionism and global fragmentation remained high on the agenda.
The ECB also continued to support G20 initiatives in the area of strengthening financial stability and resilience. This included reducing structural vulnerabilities stemming from non-bank financial intermediation and making progress towards the implementation of a regulatory framework at international and jurisdictional level to contain the risks from crypto-assets ecosystems. The ECB also supported the G20 in developing a framework to ensure just and affordable climate transitions and to accelerate the flow of sustainable investment. With regard to vulnerable countries, the ECB continued to support a predictable, timely and coordinated implementation of the Common Framework for Debt Treatments as well as measures to enhance debt transparency.
The IMF played a prominent role in supporting Ukraine and other member countries affected by the direct and indirect repercussions of Russia’s war in Ukraine, such as the energy and food crises. It deployed several measures, including a newly created food shock window under its emergency financing instruments and a new Program Monitoring with Board involvement, from which Ukraine and several other countries benefited. An Administered Account was set up to allow donor countries to securely channel financial support – loans or grants – to Ukraine using the IMF’s payment infrastructure. Moreover, the IMF has been closely engaging with Ukrainian authorities to provide technical support for Ukraine’s economic policy measures.
In terms of the IMF’s lending toolkit, the newResilience and Sustainability Trust(RST) – first proposed following the 2021 general allocation of SDRs – was approved and became operational ahead of the 2022 IMF Annual Meetings. The RST will help amplify the positive effects of the general allocation of SDRs in 2021 by facilitating the voluntary channelling of SDRs from members with strong external positions to low-income countries and vulnerable middle-income countries. RST funding can be used to address longer-term structural challenges, including climate change and pandemic preparedness, thereby contributing to prospective balance of payments stability. For contributions from the ESCB, similar to other channelling alternatives via the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, it is essential that claims on the RST maintain reserve asset quality. Among other SDR-related issues, in May 2022 the IMF concluded thefive-year review of the SDR valuation, according to which the euro remained the second largest currency by size of share after the US dollar.
Amid heightened debt vulnerabilities following the pandemic, which were further exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine, the IMF continued to develop its debt-related work agenda, completing itsReview of the Fund’s Policies on Sovereign Arrears and Related Perimeter Issuesin Spring 2022. The Review revisited the conditions under which the Fund can lend to a member country in the presence of sovereign arrears, taking into account the evolution in the creditor landscape, including the emergence of new official bilateral and institutional creditors and instruments. This includes a refinement of the claims that are subject to the policy of non-toleration of arrears, the highest level of IMF protection for the claims of international financial institutions and official bilateral creditors. The work on debt transparency under the joint IMF-World Bank Multipronged Approach to Address Debt Vulnerabilities has proceeded further. The IMF also completed theReview of The Institutional View on the Liberalization and Management of Capital Flowsin March 2022. This forms part of its surveillance activities, which are increasingly important in the light of the slowing growth momentum, tightening financial conditions, and the impact of the energy and food crises.
In 2022 the ECB closely monitored the developments on sustainability reporting at European and international level to continuously increase transparency on its activities in the environmental, social and governance fields. Key work in these areas was carried out throughout the year including the achievement of several milestones set for the ECB’s climate agenda, the launch of awareness-raising campaigns and easy access to advice on ethics and good conduct to address the growing relevance of ethics and compliance issues, the expansion of the ways in which the ECB communicates with the public and the adjustment of human resources policies and practices to the new ways of working that emerged after the pandemic.
11.1 The ECB’s response to sustainability and related impacts and risks
The ECB first started reporting on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters in a more holistic manner in 2021, based on a materiality assessment which identified key sustainability topics for the organisation. This exercise also guided the ECB’s disclosures for 2022, which were further enriched through an initial analysis of the sustainability topics identified in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards in 2022.[70]
As a public institution, the ECB strives for the highest level of integrity and good conduct, continuously monitoring and adapting its frameworks to make them fit for purpose in a fast-changing world (see Section 11.2). With regard to its social impacts, the ECB has made further efforts to explain its policies to the public, targeting different audiences and addressing the concerns of citizens, while also creating space for conversations with the public on a regular basis. Section 11.3 sets out the key activities in this domain in 2022. The ECB also updated its human resources policies and practices in line with the new ways of working that arose in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included developing a new, flexible teleworking policy, introducing new learning programmes and advancing its diversity and inclusion initiatives, as outlined in Section 11.4. In 2022 the ECB further defined its strategic approach to climate change by developing an ECB climate agenda (see Section 11.5).
In addition to assessing ESG aspects from an impact perspective, the ECB considers sustainability risks under its existing governance framework, as highlighted in the chapter on risk management in the Annual Accounts.
11.2 Strengthening ethics and integrity
The ECB actively promotes an organisational culture of ethics and compliance, ensuring that its high-level officials, management and staff members perform their functions in accordance with the highest standards of conduct. The Compliance and Governance Office (CGO) is responsible for establishing the rules on ethics and governance for ECB staff and for monitoring compliance with these. It organises awareness campaigns, training courses and e‑learning programmes, and provides individual advice and guidance on ethical issues. In 2022 efforts were made to enhance awareness about these rules and facilitate access to advice on ethics. Noting the importance of a prompt delivery of quality guidance, the CGO developed an ethics chatbot, which is able to provide general information and replies to straightforward questions in several ethical areas in real time. As a result, the number of queries submitted to the CGO fell by almost 20% from approximately 2,050 in 2021 to 1,690 in 2022, allowing the ethics and compliance experts to focus on more complex issues (Chart 11.1).
In addition to its regular information and advisory activities, the ECB invested in further strengthening its integrity and good conduct frameworks. In 2022 the ECB adopted a structured approach to managing the risk incurred if contractors working in sensitive areas do not behave according to the ECB’s ethics standards. The new approach complements the ECB’s vendor risk management framework and provides guidance on the monitoring and management of conduct risk during contract implementation.
An independent Ethics Committee provides advice to high-level ECB officials on questions of ethics, mostly concerning private activities and post-mandate gainful employment, and assesses their declarations of interests. In line with the ECB’s commitment to transparency and public trust-building, theopinions of the Ethics Committeeon conflicts of interest, post‑mandate gainful employment and private activities, as well as thedeclarations of interestsof high-level officials are published on the ECB website.
In addition, the Ethics Committee monitors international developments in the field of ethics and good conduct and advises on desirable updates of the ECB’s ethics framework for high-level ECB officials. At the end of 2021 the Ethics Committee proposed a review of the rules governing private financial transactions to further mitigate the risks of misuse of confidential information and possible conflicts of interest. As a result, in November 2022 the Governing Council adopted an enhanced Single Code of Conduct imposing additional restrictions on the investment universe and horizon of private financial transactions, as well as new transparency obligations.[71]
At Eurosystem level, the Ethics and Compliance Conference, which comprises the Chief Ethics Officers of the ECB, national central banks (NCBs) and national competent authorities (NCAs), supported the ongoing implementation of the Ethics Guidelines adopted in 2021, which promote a consistent interpretation of the provisions across the national institutions.[72]To reflect the growing importance of ethics and compliance, the Governing Council decided to transform the Conference into an Ethics and Compliance Committee.
The ECB participates in joint activities and knowledge-sharing with the ethics functions of European institutions and international organisations. To encourage conversations on ethics and integrity, the Ethics and Compliance Committee organised thematic sessions with guest speakers from European and international organisations. In 2022 the ECB participated in interinstitutional discussions on the establishment of an independent ethics body common to all EU institutions, contributed to the Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption andassumed the role of Vice-Chair of theEthics Network of Multilateral Organizations.
11.3 Enhancing transparency and fostering understanding of ECB policy
In 2022 the surge in inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis created a challenging environment, including for the ECB’s communication. During times of exceptional uncertainty, clear, credible and consistent communication is particularly essential to anchor expectations and foster trust among the public in the ECB’s commitment and ability to restore price stability. To that end, the ECB continued its major efforts to foster better understanding of its decisions among both experts and the wider public, using innovative formats and adopting a multilingual approach.
With inflation rising to levels not seen in the history of the euro, and the ECB taking decisive monetary policy action, it was essential to step up communication and provide accessible explanations. First and foremost, this included reassuring European citizens about the ECB’s core commitment to bring inflation back to its 2% target over the medium term and its ability to deliver price stability with the tools at its disposal. At the same time, it was important to acknowledge that high inflation is a strain on everyone in the economy and that the necessary monetary policy tightening will also cause pain.
The ECB undertook major efforts to explain how its policy decisions will affect inflation. The interest rate hike in July 2022 was the first in 11 years. To explain to the wider public what higher interest rates seek to achieve, what they mean concretely for people and their economic choices, the ECB ran an extensive communication campaign. This involved publishing a newexplainer(available in all EU languages) and arranging a number of TV and radio appearances by ECB Executive Board members and staff members to explain the various decisions and the reasoning behind them, as well as to address concerns.
In addition, a dedicatedECB Podcast episodeexplained the basic mechanisms of how higher interest rates can rein in inflation, and a secondpodcaston why monetary policy tightening needs to continue despite a weakening economy.
Sharing more of the insights and analysis that feed into ECB decisions can also help to foster understanding of the ECB’s policy among the interested public. To that end, 2022 saw the launch of a revampedECB Blog, which now includes contributions from both Executive Board members and ECB staff.
With a fresh look and a steady flow of interesting and visually attractive posts, the ECB Blog has become an appealing channel for learning about a variety of central banking topics, ranging from differences in how men and women “feel” inflation to the financing of green innovation and the rise and fall of crypto-assets. Since blog posts are, as a rule, concise and written in accessible language, they tend to attract a readership that goes beyond experts and academics.
In 2022 the ECB also followed up on its commitment stemming from the ECB’s monetary policy strategy review to expand the reach of its communication and engagement beyond financial markets and experts to focus more on the wider public. Based on the finding from internal research that the majority of Europeans (79%) hear about the ECB via television, with radio and other general interest media also playing a very important role, the ECB focused its efforts on these media in 2022. This was reflected in the significant increase in the presence of ECB Executive Board members on radio and television (Chart 11.2).
As younger people in particular increasingly access news via digital channels, the ECB also strengthened its online presence. It did so by enhancing its websites and by expanding its activity and using new formats on a variety of social media platforms, leading to continued growth in the number of followers.
In view of the outcome of the strategy review, the ECB had also committed to making direct engagement and interaction with the wider public a structural part of its communication – in other words, to expand on its one-way communication to encompass two-way conversation. To that end, the “ECB Listens” concept developed into a new “ECB & You” format. “ECB & You” seeks to enable direct dialogue between the ECB’s top representatives and the public. It aims for the widest possible reach, for instance via suitable TV programmes in euro area countries. The first event of this kind on a Dutch TV programme called “College Tour” gave local students an opportunity to interact live with President Lagarde on a variety of topics, including inflation, the digital euro, crypto-assets and career advice.
To reach the wider public effectively, the ECB has to speak to people in their own languages. Taking a multilingual approach to communications is the only way it can do this. To that end, significant parts of the ECB’s websites are available in all 24 official EU languages, including in Irish from 2022.
Providing access to documents is a key part of the ECB’s transparency policy. In 2022 the ECB undertook several initiatives to facilitate the submission and handling of requests for public access to ECB documents. Not least, following up on the policies and practices proposed by the European Ombudsman to give effect to the right of public access to documents, the ECB enhanced the information available on itsAccess to documents web pageby publishing its filing and retention plan, as well as summary information on the requests for public access received in the previous year. With regard to therecommendations on the recording of text and instant messages sent/received by staff members in their professional capacity, the ECB prepared guidance for staff on the strictly limited use and mandatory recording of text and instant messages exchanged for business purposes.
No findings of maladministration were raised by the European Ombudsman regarding the ECB’s handling of public access requests.
To facilitate the handling of requests for public access to ECB documents within the ECB, the Eurosystem and the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the CGO developed a portal on transparency and access to documents, accessible to staff of the ECB, NCBs and NCAs. It provides easy access to the legal framework and procedures to follow, as well as information on past cases. It also raises awareness about transparency developments at the EU and international levels.
In 2022 the ECB responded to around 10,400 enquiries from European citizens, an increase of 7% compared with 2021. Citizens requested information or commented on a wide variety of topics, including inflation, interest rates, Russia’s war in Ukraine, climate change, the euro and exchange rates.
11.4 Empowering our people to excel for Europe
After more than two years of mostly working remotely, in 2022 ECB staff gradually returned to the office and started preparing for a new way of working. To support them during this period, we developed and adapted our people policies and initiatives. We continued to run pulse checks to check in with our employees on their well-being, connectedness and initial experiences with hybrid working. As we shifted to a hybrid working model, we also strengthened our diversity and inclusion efforts to create a workplace where everyone feels safe, valued and respected for who they are.
In May 2022 ECB staff entered a transition phase during which they gradually returned to the office, based on a minimum on-site presence of eight days per month. In parallel, we launched a Hybrid Working Model pilot to collect initial experiences with hybrid working. Roughly 1,400 employees from six business areas took part. The findings from the pilot, together with the feedback shared by ECB staff via different channels, extensive benchmarking and several rounds of consultation with our staff representatives all fed into the ECB’s new teleworking policy. This new policy, effective as of 1 January 2023, stands out in terms of overall flexibility compared with other organisations, allowing ECB staff to telework up to 110 days per year (around 50% of their working time).
To gain insight into our employees’ well-being, productivity, connectedness and first experiences with hybrid working, we continued to run pulse checks, with participation rates of around 60%. While our employees’ well-being continued to improve in the first part of the year, it dropped towards the end of the year despite an improved feeling of connectedness after returning to the offices. Our latest pulse check showed that our employees feel well equipped to work in a hybrid way and that83% of them feel proud to work for the ECB and 72% would recommend the ECB asa great place to work.
In 2022 we offered learning initiatives to accelerate digital business transformation, equip our staff for hybrid working and support their professional development. For example, we launched a digital dexterity learning portfolio that included masterclasses and e-learning courses for leaders and all staff and re-introduced a Leadership Growth Programme for our ECB leaders. In parallel to enabling our employees to access learning material from the European Commission and other EU institutions, as well as LinkedIn Learning through the Commission’s learning portal “EU Learn”, we launched EUREKA (“European Expertise & Knowledge Academy”), our new virtual learning platform. EUREKApromotes knowledge-sharing and collaboration. It also gathers learning and mobility opportunities within the ECB in one place. From 2023 it will also cover learning and mobility opportunities across other institutions in the ESCB and SSM.
We use mobility to foster versatility and to attract talented people with new perspectives. This proved useful during the pandemic when we redeployed ECB staff on mobility to their former business areas in response to urgent business needs. In 2022 staff mobility in the ECB across business areas decreased slightly to 4.3% (compared with 4.5% in 2021). However, mobility within the ESCB and SSM increased thanks to two related initiatives: the relaunched Schuman programme and a new “System-wide Virtual Teams” programme pilot, allowing both ECB staff and staff from other ESCB and SSM institutions to work on interesting projects remotely (Table 11.1).
The ECB took several measures to support Ukrainian nationals after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We launched a traineeship for Ukrainian graduates and offered short-term contracts to Ukrainian professionals. In September 2022 we welcomed 15 Ukrainian trainees and two short-term employees. We also ensured that our childcare and accommodation service providers were available for Ukrainian refugees. Furthermore, we have been working on offering opportunities to staff from the National Bank of Ukraine.
Attracting diverse talent is crucial for the ECB to be able to make the best possible decisions for the citizens it serves. To achieve this, in 2022 the ECB participated in several careers fairs, such as the careers fair organised by ADAN (Afro Deutsches Akademiker Netzwerk), Europe's largest careers fair for black people and people of colour, and EUROUT, Europe’s leading LGBTQ+ business conference. We also successfully launched a traineeship pilot for applicants on the autism spectrum.
We continued monitoring our progress towards our2020-26 gender targetsthrough improved gender scorecards. In 2022 the ECB met its target to hire and promote women in at least 50% of cases at management level (all management and senior management). However, the targets were missed at the (team) lead, expert and analyst levels by between 10 and 6 percentage points. When it comes to the overall share of women in the relevant salary band groups, the 2022 targets were achieved at management (all management and senior management) and analyst levels. However, the targets were missed at the (team) lead and expert levels by 2 percentage points and 1 percentage point respectively (Table 11.2). We will continue to strengthen our efforts to achieve gender balance.
We also implemented further measures focused on the intersection of gender with other aspects of diversity, such as age, ethnicity and disability. One such measure was the launch of our redesignedECB Scholarship for Women.
At the ECB, we strive to create a working culture where all employees feel included and respected, and where individual backgrounds, experiences and abilities are welcomed and valued. To enable such a culture and engage with our employees on this topic, in 2022 we continued to roll out our Inclusion Programme. In addition to providing training and e-learning courses, we launched several workshops focusing on inclusive behaviours within teams. Furthermore, President Christine Lagarde and the governors of 28 NCBs and NCAs signed anEquality, diversity and inclusion charterto promote a culture based on respect, dignity and inclusion across the ESCB and SSM.
11.5 Addressing environmental and climate-related challenges
The ECB is committed to playing its part in the fight against climate change and in addressing climate-related risks, within its mandate. In 2021 the ECB strengthened the governance of its climate-related work by setting up the climate change centre (CCC), which reports directly to the ECB President and regularly updates the Executive Board on progress and priorities.
The CCC designs and steers the ECB’s strategy on climate and advances climate-related work in collaboration with relevant internal and external stakeholders. Regular meetings with ECB senior managers serve as a forum for coordination and information exchange.
Climate-related considerations are already integrated in the ECB’s existing governance structures, for example in its assessment of climate-related risks, as well as in monetary policy operations, non-monetary policy portfolios, financial stability and operational risk management wherever relevant. Furthermore, in 2022 the ECB decided to adopt an internal framework supporting the integration of the objectives of the European Climate Law into the ECB’s policies, projects and activities and to report on these measures in the Annual Report. Within the Eurosystem, a new climate change forum was established to deepen collaboration on information-sharing and capacity-building, as well as to foster innovation in climate-related work. Policy issues related to climate change continue to be addressed in the relevant Eurosystem and ESCB committees.
TheECB climate agendawas launched in 2022 and sets out the strategic objectives, priorities and a roadmap for the ECB’s work in this area. It is guided by three strategic objectives. First, the ECB manages and mitigates the financial risks associated with climate change and assesses its economic impact. Second, it supports an orderly transition to a climate-neutral economy with measures that are within its mandate. Third, it shares expertise with the aim of fostering action beyond the ECB. The ECB’s climate agenda will be regularly updated, with details on the activities supporting the achievement of the strategic objectives grouped under six priority areas as outlined in Figure 11.1.
In 2022 the ECB took further steps to incorporate climate change considerations into its activities within its mandate and given the tasks at hand.
Through its analytical work, the ECB continued to assess the macroeconomic impact of climate change and mitigation policies on inflation and the real economy. TheDecember 2022 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro areaincluded an evaluation of the macroeconomic impact of climate change-related fiscal measures, such as energy taxes, on growth and inflation. The main results were published in theEconomic Bulletin. Analytical work focused, among other things, on assessing the impact of extreme weather events on inflation. Furthermore, the ECB made progress on integrating climate change considerations into the macroeconomic modelling toolbox.
The Eurosystem developedclimate-related statistical indicators, including experimental indicators for sustainable financial instruments and analytical indicators on financial institutions’ exposures to physical risk and the carbon footprint of their portfolios. These indicators will be developed further. In this context, the Eurosystem also aims to improve the availability and quality of climate data, for instance by means of assessing and incorporating public data sources for the analysis of transition and physical risk and through the procurement of commercial data to close existing data gaps.
To enhance the assessment of climate-related financial risks, in 2022 the Eurosystem conducted a first climate stress test of several of the financial exposures on its balance sheet. The main results relating to the corporate bond portfolio were published in the Eurosystem’s climate-related financial disclosures in March 2023. The Eurosystem also developedcommon minimum standards for incorporating climate change risks into the in-house credit assessment systemsof NCBs for Eurosystem collateral, which will enter into force by the end of 2024. ECB analysis also provided further evidence on the systemic nature of climate risks and made the case for adapting existing macroprudential policy instruments to mitigate such risks for the financial system.[73]
Climate and environmental risks are being further integrated into the ECB’s banking supervision and are identified as asupervisory priorityfor 2023-25. Information on the key actions taken in 2022 is provided in theECB Annual Report on supervisory activities.
The Eurosystem tookfurther stepsto incorporate climate change into its monetary policy operations. As of October 2022 the Eurosystem began todecarbonise the corporate bond holdings in its monetary policy portfoliosby tilting its holdings towards issuers with a better climate performance as measured by past emissions, the ambitiousness of emission reduction plans and the quality of reporting.
Furthermore, in its collateral framework, the Eurosystem decided to limit the share of assets issued by non-financial corporations with a high carbon footprint that counterparties can pledge as collateral when borrowing from the Eurosystem. The limitation will apply by the end of 2024, provided that the necessary technical preconditions are in place. Furthermore, in December 2022 the ECB considered climate risks during its regular reviews of haircuts applied to corporate bonds used as collateral for the first time. The2022 review of risk control measuresdid not find evidence that called for changes to the haircut schedule based on climate considerations, as the updated haircut schedule is already sufficiently protective against climate-related financial risks. Other measures in the collateral framework include the introduction of disclosure-related eligibility requirements, expected to apply as of 2026, for entities that are subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and the above-mentioned enhancement of risk assessment.
In the areas of EU and international policy and financial regulation, the ECB actively participated in discussions on sustainable finance in relevant fora, including the G7, G20, Financial Stability Board, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), European Banking Authority and EFRAG. Through this, the ECB aims to further advance the regulatory framework to address climate change, improve climate risk analysis and climate scenarios, act as a catalyst to improve reporting from its perspective, fill data gaps and ultimately help scale up private and public sustainable finance. Examples of the ECB’s work in the field of EU sustainable finance and climate legislation include theopinion on the proposed recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directiveand its contribution to developing the European Sustainability Reporting Standards as observer on the Sustainability Reporting Board of EFRAG. At the international level, the ECB also currently chairs the workstream on Scenario Design and Analysis and the Experts’ Network on Legal Issues of the NGFS.
In itsEnvironmental Statement 2022the ECB set out how it plans to align its business operations with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The plan focuses on reducing travel and conference-related environmental impacts and engaging with suppliers via tools offered by sustainable procurement processes to manage impacts along the value chain. Progress was also made in the assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the second series of euro banknotes over the lifecycle. Based on the information available, research activities were launched and policies implemented to minimise the environmental impact of euro banknotes, such as the use of sustainable cotton for banknote paper, the extension of banknotes’ life in circulation and the use of more sustainable methods to dispose of used banknotes.
With regard to increased transparency, in March 2023 the ECB and the Eurosystem published their firstclimate-related financial disclosuresof the euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios of the ECB and the Eurosystem NCBs and of the Eurosystem corporate bond portfolio for monetary policy purposes. The ECB’s report on non-monetary policy portfolios explains the ECB’s investment strategy and outlines the progress made on decarbonising its own funds and staff pension fund portfolios.
Changing jobs within the ECB or working temporarily at another central bank or partner institution has become an integral part of the professional and personal development of colleagues within the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks. Such mobility opportunities are a great tool for staff to broaden their knowledge and skills, while allowing them to contribute their specific expertise to important projects with a European impact.
The following stories give an insight into the rich array of assignments undertaken by colleagues via various forms of mobility.
After a temporary assignment in Directorate General (DG) Secretariat under the ECB’s internal mobility scheme, I returned in 2022 to DG Economics to undertake a challenging project. I was entrusted the task of co-leading a group of experts from the ECB and national central banks to investigate issues related to forecasting owner-occupied housing costs.
Interestingly, the current inflation measure only partially includes the housing service costs of homeowners associated with owning, maintaining and living in their own home, even though these represent key expenditure items. While the future inclusion of these costs in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices is a multi-year project under the remit of the European Statistical System, forecasting inflation and its components is one of the main tasks of a central bank.
Having worked previously on various aspects of inflation forecasting, I was interested in gaining an understanding of the challenges involved in forecasting owner-occupied housing costs and investigating ways to address these. I found interacting with colleagues from the national central banks particularly rewarding. We worked closely on the project and were able to share diverse insights and information on country particularities. This was extremely useful given the heterogeneity of housing markets across the euro area. I felt that we managed to deepen our understanding of the costs associated with owner-occupied housing and the potential impact of including them in the HICP from the forecasting and monitoring perspectives.
While addressing climate change is a global challenge that requires global action, central banks operate in very different circumstances. Having been involved as a member of the DG Market Operations team in shaping the ECB’s initial thinking on how to integrate climate change into its monetary policy framework, I was curious to understand how other central banks operating in different environments address this challenge. Thanks to a special mobility initiative among the EU’s national central banks (Schuman Programme), I was able to join theNGFSSecretariat (hosted by the Banque de France), where I support theworkstream on monetary policy. My focus area is the greening of monetary policy operations, which involves facilitating exchanges between more experienced central banks, including the ECB, and central banks that are exploring the possibility of making climate-related adaptations to their respective operational frameworks.
Thanks to this very rewarding assignment I have been able to learn first-hand about central banks’ actions and initiatives, and facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experience across institutions. On a personal level, while relocating my family from Frankfurt am Main to the Paris area was challenging, it has also created opportunities for personal growth and long-lasting memories.
I started my career at the ECB in the Governance and Transformation Services Division, where I was involved in IT governance and digital transformation. After a few years, I realised that I would be interested in getting to know the ECB from a different perspective and bringing my experience to a new context. Thanks to an opportunity for internal mobility, in 2022 I joined the Data and Analytics Services Division of DG Information Systems. My new Division works on cutting-edge data platforms and analytical applications that help the ECB meet its goal of becoming a data-driven organisation.
I currently work on a centralised data collection platform called CASPER, which automates the submission of data to the ECB from anywhere in the world in a self-service mode and within a short time frame. More than 3,000 users and 175 different institutions currently use it to fulfil their reporting obligations.
In my new role, I am involved in project management and business analysis. Together with colleagues from DG Statistics, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our services. For example, my new Division has initiated a Common Data Management programme. This is a complex project, which aims to build a new-generation data management and analytics platform for all ESCB and SSM users. There are many transformational challenges ahead, but our team spirit and constructive approach are one of our strengths!
Being on mobility has been enriching, both professionally and personally. It has allowed me to expand my network and work on innovative assignments wearing my two hats: contributing a different perspective thanks to my “newcomer’s eyes” combined with my experience as a seasoned professional.
In 2022 I joined the ECB’s Monetary Policy Strategy Division on secondment from Suomen Pankki under a Eurosystem staff mobility initiative called the Schuman Programme. As an economist with expertise in the payments field, I contribute to analysing the monetary policy effects of a digital euro with colleagues from various ECB business areas. While a digital euro could offer a wide range of benefits, it could also have monetary policy and financial stability implications depending on the extent to which it would become a substitute for bank deposits.
I am involved in a project that aims to predict the potential demand for a digital euro depending on its design features. The findings of this research can be used to gauge the impact of introducing a digital euro on households’ bank deposits and cash holdings. Insights from the analysis also shed light on how different design choices affect the demand for a digital euro and the way in which demand varies according to household characteristics and across euro area countries.
This secondment has offered me a unique opportunity to enhance my skills, grow my networks, get to know the ECB better and contribute to an incredibly interesting project. It has been an inspiring experience to see so many talented people working together towards common goals."
175,2022-12-20,—,Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE) – 2022,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/space/html/ecb.spacereport202212~783ffdf46e.en.html,"
The ongoing digitalisation of the economy affects almost all aspects of our daily lives, including the ways in which we pay. The Eurosystem has a key interest in understanding how the payment landscape is evolving and how citizens in the euro area pay for goods and services, as well as how they pay to each other. Ensuring access to means of payment, cash and cashless, is at the heart of both the Eurosystem’s retail payments strategy and its Cash 2030 strategy.
To get a better understanding of how consumers are changing their payment habits, and to what extent, in 2019 the ECB launched a survey to investigate the payment attitudes and behaviours of euro area citizens. To capture changing payment behaviour in a timely manner, the Eurosystem decided to repeat the survey every two years.
The second of these surveys was launched in 2021 and completed in 2022. This report presents the results and describes the key trends identified in euro area consumer payments. While the move towards cashless payments continues, as the report shows, cash still plays an important role. It remains the predominant payment method at the point of sale and for person-to-person payments. Nonetheless, cashless payments are on the rise, supported by a shift from purchases at the point of sale to online purchases. The rate of increase varies across countries and demographic groups. Taking into account ongoing shifts in the payment landscape, the report sheds light on the perceived availability and costs of instant payments for consumers, and on the ownership and use of crypto assets for payment and investment purposes.
Monitoring these trends closely going forward is important for us, in view of our responsibility for issuing public money (currently in the form of cash, and possibly in the future in the form of a digital euro alongside cash) and promoting the smooth functioning of payment systems. This will help us ensure that means of payment remain accessible to all euro area citizens, regardless of their age, income or place of residence, guaranteeing consumers’ freedom to choose how they pay, even in a time of digital transformation.

Following on from the first Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE) in 2019, the European Central Bank (ECB) has now conducted a second one. This report presents the key findings from SPACE 2022 and compares them with the results of the 2019 study and, where relevant, with an earlier ECB study conducted in 2016, the Study on the use of cash by households in the euro area (SUCH). When interpreting the 2022 results it is important to note that while no major lockdowns were in place in most euro area countries during the fieldwork periods, the payment behaviour of consumers was still affected by various measures related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic – both before and between the survey rounds. These led to restricted entry and even closure of some points of sale, such as restaurants and venues for culture and entertainment, in some Member States.
The SPACE 2022 results show that:
The way consumers in the euro area pay and the payment instruments they prefer are constantly evolving. Monitoring payment methods on a continuous basis makes it possible to capture changes in consumer demand and market trends.
The Study on the use of cash by households in the euro area (SUCH)[1]was the first payment behaviour survey conducted by the ECB, back in 2016. Results from SUCH are only comparable to the SPACE studies to a limited extent because the survey modes were different and the output variables only partially overlap. The first study on payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE)[2]was conducted in 2019 and will be followed up by comparable surveys on a biannual basis.
The results from the SPACE survey make it possible to estimate the share of different payment instruments used by consumers at the point of sale (POS),[3]for person-to-person payments (P2P),[4]online and for recurring payments[5]in various ways, including by demographics and payment patterns. In addition, the surveys give an insight into consumers’ access to and acceptance of cash and other means of payment.
Compared to the 2019 survey, SPACE 2022 additionally looked at: (i) changes in payment behaviour since the onset of the pandemic; (ii) recent trends in digital payments, such as the availability and perceived cost of instant payments; (iii) crypto assets, including information on respondents’ ownership and usage patterns. The results should also serve to better illustrate consumers’ preferences for cash holdings.
Data for SPACE 2022[6]were collected through a survey of a random sample of the population in all euro area countries. The most important methodological choices – such as the survey mode, sampling strategy and weighting methodology – were identical to SPACE 2019, making the results of most indicators comparable. A detailed description of the methodologies used is available in a separate document[7]This section briefly summarises the methodology.
The ECB coordinated the data collection in 17 euro area countries, i.e. all except Germany and the Netherlands. The Deutsche Bundesbank (2022) and De Nederlandsche Bank and the Dutch Payments Association (2022) collected their own data with questionnaires harmonised to a large extent with the one used in the other countries.
The data for all countries except Germany and the Netherlands were collected using an identical questionnaire translated into national languages. The market research company Kantar Public was responsible for data collection. 50% of the interviews were collected in computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and 50% in computer-assisted web interviews (CAWI). The CATI sample was drawn with probabilistic methods, while the CAWI sample was drawn from non-probabilistic Kantar Public online panels. For both samples, quotas for country, age, gender and day of the week were set. The total sample size achieved in the 17 euro area countries was 39,765 respondents.
The interview process consisted of three parts: a recruitment interview, the recording period and the main (follow up) interview. The payment diary was split into modules covering (i) POS payments, (ii) P2P payments, (iii) online payments and (iv) recurring payments. Survey respondents were asked to report their POS, P2P and online transactions in a one-day diary, and their recurring payments from the past 30 days.[8]
When interpreting the survey results it is important to recognise the benefits and caveats of recording payment behaviour in one-day diaries. Transactions are recorded more comprehensively in diaries covering one day than those with a period of several days (Jonker and Kosse, 2013). However, the degree of uncertainty involved in any survey data is more pronounced in one-day diaries, especially for drawing conclusions on countries and other subgroups of the population with small sample sizes. Data from a longer diary period include more transactions per sample unit and consequently increase the precision of the estimated indicators (Schmidt,  2014). In particular, indicators on the value of POS and online payments need to be interpreted with care.
In addition to the diary, respondents were asked questions about their behaviour and attitudes to cash and cashless payment instruments in the main interview. Further questions aimed to understand which financial products were available to them, the extent of their access to the internet and how the pandemic had impacted their payment behaviour.
SPACE 2022 interviews were conducted in two survey rounds. During the first, between 2 October and 7 December 2021, 40% of interviews were carried out; the remaining ones were held in the second round, between 17 March and 9 June 2022. The survey rounds were spread across different months of the year to cover various periods and capture seasonal patterns in peoples’ payment behaviour (see Table 1).[9]
In Germany the data were collected in one survey round between 8 September and 5 December 2021. In contrast to the ECB data collection, the German participants were asked to complete a three-day diary. In the Netherlands the diary data and main questionnaire were collected for different samples; the diary data were collected in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the data for the main questionnaire in the first quarter of 2022.
After the fieldwork period the data were cleaned, edited, and imputed.[10]The sample was weighted to minimise the observable bias of survey estimates and enable solid inferences to be made based on the demographic characteristics.
The report includes figures from SUCH 2016 and SPACE 2019 when comparison with SPACE 2022 results is deemed practical and the data are comparable. In addition, after the first iteration of SPACE data collection in 2019, the ECB collected information on the impact of the early phases of the pandemic in a separate survey (the survey on the impact of the pandemic on cash trends or IMPACT survey). Some results of that survey were included in SPACE 2019 and are referred to in this report.
For time series comparisons the payment diary data from 2016 and 2019 were adjusted for inflation. For each country, one price adjustment factor per year was applied.[11]Most of the 2019 data are comparable with the 2022 data. However, due to a change in the definition of online payments between 2019 and 2022,[12]online purchases paid with cash or bank cheques in the 2019 data have been re-classified as POS payments.[13]
Two major trends in the way consumers pay for their daily non-recurring payments between 2019 and 2022 have been identified. First, online payments[14]have become more frequent. Second, the share of cash payments at the POS has declined. The less frequent use of cash was already identified in 2019 and the pandemic probably accelerated both trends.
Even though no major lockdowns were in place in most euro area countries during the fieldwork periods,[15]the payment behaviour of consumers was still affected by various measures related to the pandemic. However, it is still uncertain whether this tendency will continue at the pace observed over the past three years, or return to its pre-pandemic path once certain causes inherent in the pandemic cease to apply.
2.1 Change in the breakdown of non-recurring payments
Non-recurring day-to-day payments consist of payments made to purchase goods and services at the physical point of sale, P2P payments not connected to the purchase of goods and services and online payments. Online payments were defined as goods and services ordered and paid for online. However, goods ordered online but paid while picking up the goods or to the courier delivering the goods were defined as POS payments.
The share of online payments in consumers’ non-recurring purchases increased considerably between 2019 and 2022 in the euro area. Even though there were no major lockdowns in most euro area countries during the fieldwork periods of the latest SPACE survey, those experienced between the data collection periods may have changed the behaviour of some consumers and made them better acquainted with purchasing goods and services online. As shown in Chart 1, of all day-to-day payments, 17% were made online in 2022, compared with only 6% in 2019. In terms of value, the share of online payments in 2022 was 28% (up from 14%), indicating that online payments were more frequently used for larger payment amounts.
The share of the number of P2P transactions in non-recurring payments declined slightly, down from 5% to 4%. The change in the value of P2P payments declined a little more, from 7% to 5%.
2.2 Use of cash is declining, but remains most important at the POS
The share of cash payments at the point of sale[16]in terms of volume has declined in recent years. This decline accelerated during the pandemic. In 2022, 59% of transactions were carried out using cash. Three years earlier the share of cash transactions was 72%; in 2016 the figure was 79%. However, cash remained the most frequently used method for payments at the POS in the euro area.
When measuring POS transactions in terms of value, the share of card transactions in 2022 (46%) was higher than the share of cash transactions (42%) for the first time. In 2019 the share of cash transactions by value was 47% and the equivalent share of card transactions 43% (Chart 2).
Consumers were making payments using mobile phone apps more often than before. However, their share in total POS payments was still relatively low compared to cash and card payments. Mobile phone payments accounted for 3% of the number of transactions in 2022 (up from 1% in 2019) and 4% of the value (up from 1%).
Of all non-recurring payment transactions in 2022, 80% were POS, 17% online and 4% P2P. The share of POS in terms of value was approximately two-thirds. Pronounced differences in the breakdown of payment instrument use can be observed from these differing payment situations.
3.1 Share of online payments in non-recurring payments
As seen in Box 1, self-assessment information provided by consumers suggests they increased their online shopping during the pandemic. This change was also reflected in the data on actual payment behaviour in every euro area country (Chart 3). Online payments have become more frequent in comparison to POS and P2P across the euro area. In 2022, at least 10% of all non-recurring transactions were online payments in every euro area country. This is a notable change, given that online payments accounted for less than 5% of non-recurring payments in Malta, Cyprus and Germany in 2019. In several countries the share of online payments in 2022 was over 20%, the highest values being reported in Belgium (24%), Austria and Ireland (both 21%) and France (20%).
Online payments were more frequently made for larger-value purchases. The share of online payments was higher in terms of value than number. The highest shares of online payments by value were reported in Slovenia (40%), Finland (37%), Belgium (36%) and Austria (35%).
Chart 4 shows that the share of online transactions in non-recurring payments decreases by age, except for those aged 18-24, who made slightly fewer online purchases than those aged 25-39. The reason for this may be that consumers under the age of 24 have less frequent access to payment accounts than other age groups (see Chapter 8.2). Comparing young adults (25-39) to those aged 65 and older, the share of online payments falls from 22% to only 11%. However, people in the latter age group made more online purchases than three years ago.
The share of online shopping was also significantly higher for consumers with higher education. Improvements in the market for online shopping have enabled consumers with sufficient technological literacy to conduct more price arbitrage for their non-recurring payments. The relationship between household income and online purchases is not straightforward. When measured in terms of number of payments, the share of online purchases in non-recurring payments was highest for the two lowest income groups, and relatively similar for households in income groups with monthly income above €1,000.
3.2 POS transactions
There are large cross-country differences in the payment habits of consumers when purchasing goods or services at the POS (Chart 5). In several countries, a clear majority of POS payments in 2022 were made in cash. The highest shares in terms of number of payments were observed in Malta (77%), Slovenia (73%), Austria (70%) and Italy (69%), and in terms of value of payments in Malta (65%), Lithuania (61%) and Slovenia (59%). Card payments were the most frequently used method at the POS in 2022 in four euro area countries: Finland (70%), the Netherlands (67%), Luxembourg (52%) and Belgium (48%). In Estonia, the share of card payments was almost identical to the share of cash payments (both 46%).
Although payments with mobile apps have increased in recent years, their share in POS payments was still relatively low. The share of mobile payments (by number of transactions) was highest in the Netherlands (10%), and exceeded 5% in Finland, Ireland, Latvia and Luxembourg.
Compared with 2019, the use of cash has declined. This was observed across most euro area countries, although in both Slovenia and Estonia the share of cash payments is virtually unchanged. Cash use declined most in southern European countries: Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal (Figure 1). Measured by value, the share of cash payments has even increased in some euro area countries.
The indicators on payments by value reflect uncertainties, as well as the data for countries that have a small sample size. In particular, variations between the different years and among countries in such cases should be interpreted with caution.[17]
Looking at the share of cash transactions at the POS by age group, it can be seen that older age groups (i.e. those over 55) tended to use cash relatively more often than younger generations (Chart 6). The share of cash payments in the oldest age group was 5 percentage points higher than the average for all consumers; among those aged 25-39 (who make the least cash payments) it was 4 percentage points lower than the euro area average.
Overall for the euro area, all age groups made more than half of their POS payments in cash. The differences among age groups are similar in terms of value of transactions. All age groups made more payments with cards than with cash in terms of value.
The share of cash payments also declines as respondents’ level of education and income rises.[18]Those with a low level of education reported a share of cash transactions 8 percentage points higher than individuals with a high level of education.[19]The highest earning group paid just above half of its POS transactions with cash, while the lowest income group paid two-thirds. In terms of value, the two highest income groups paid more than 50% of their POS payments with cards.
3.3 P2P payments
P2P payments are private payments between individuals not connected to the purchase of goods and services. Examples may include giving pocket money to children or donating money to charity. The breakdown of P2P payments by instrument is quite different from that of POS payments. As can be expected, the role of cards in P2P payments is small, given that private individuals rarely have ability to accept card payments. On the other hand, cash and mobile payments are used for P2P payments more frequently than for POS payments (Chart 7).
Cash was the dominant means of payment in P2P transactions, although its share in the total number of payments in the euro area declined from 86% in 2019 to 73% in 2022, as shown in Chart 7. In terms of value, the share of cash declined from 65% to 59%. P2P payments with mobile phone apps are becoming more frequent. In 2022,10% of P2P payments were made using mobile phones, compared to 3% in 2019. The share of payment methods other than cash, cards or mobile payments also increased between 2019 and 2022, mainly due to the increase in private payments using credit transfers.
Looking at P2P payments by country in Chart 8, the share of cash in terms of the number of payments was over 80% in Germany, Cyprus, Slovenia, Greece, Italy and Austria, while cash was used for less than half of P2P transactions in Estonia, Finland and the Netherlands. The share of mobile phone apps in P2P payments was highest in the Netherlands (43%). In Finland, Estonia, Luxembourg and Malta the share of mobile payments in P2P transactions was about 25%. In value terms, the share of mobile payments was even higher, reaching 52% in the Netherlands and 34% in Luxembourg. The role of credit transfers, included in Chart 8 under Other, was also bigger in P2P payments than in payments at the POS.
3.4 Online payments
Online payments, as defined in this report, include any payments made online, excluding regular bill payments such as electricity bills or rent. These are analysed separately as recurring payments in Section 5. The SPACE 2022 diary clearly distinguished between online payments and online purchases, meaning that any orders made online but paid at the point of sale (e.g. when picking up food from a restaurant or paying a courier at the door) were reported as POS payments.[22]
Chart 3 shows that the share of the number of online payments in non-recurring payments increased significantly between 2019 and 2022. In 2022 consumers made over three times more online payments than in 2019. The breakdown of online payments, however, remained relatively stable.
More than half of online payments were made with cards (Chart 9). The share of card payments declined slightly between 2019 and 2022, from 54% down to 51%. The use of PayPal and similar online or mobile payment solutions has decreased slightly. The variety of online payment methods has grown in recent years; 9% of all online payments were made using a method the respondent could not identify from the answer options in the questionnaire.[23]
In terms of payment value, the share of credit transfers was larger. Consequently, credit transfers were used more often for large-value payments compared to other payment instruments.
The breakdown of online payments varies a great deal by country (Chart 10). The use of e-payment solutions such as iDeal, PayPal and Klarna is by far the most frequent way to pay for online purchases in the Netherlands. E-payment solutions account for a large share of all online payment methods in Germany, too.[24]However, card payments were still the most frequently used instrument for online payments in most euro area countries.
4.1 POS and online payments by value range
Purchase price influences how and where consumers pay for goods and services. Smaller-value purchases are typically paid for at the POS, with higher-value payments more often made online. In 2022, the share of POS payments under €20 was almost 60%, while only 4% of POS payments had a price higher than €100. Conversely, online purchases for less than €10 were infrequent and more than one online payment in four had a price over €50 (see Chart 11, left-hand panel).
The share of various payment instruments used for high and low-value payments is very different. Looking at POS transactions, the use of cash was especially common for purchases of lower value, in line with the findings of previous surveys. Four out of five POS purchases for less than €5 were paid with cash (Chart 11). Although mostly in line with previous surveys, the shareof card transactions for low-value payments has increased since 2019. For example, for payments below €5, the share of payments using a card went from 7% in 2019 to 15% in 2022. Similarly, for payments between €5 and €10, the share of card payments went from 15% in 2019 to 24% in 2022.
The share of cash transactions declines significantly with transaction value. For purchases over €50, cards were the most frequently used payment method at the POS. However, almost one-third of POS payments over €100 were still made with cash. The share of payments with a mobile app was relatively stable across value ranges, although they were used slightly more frequently for higher-value payments.
There is no clear pattern in the use of online payment methods for purchases of different value. Credit transfers were used more frequently for higher-value payments and cards slightly less frequently. PayPal and other e-payment solutions were used for about one online payment in four, regardless of their value.
4.2 POS and online payments by location and purpose
Payments at the point of sale include very different kinds of purchases. Consumers can for example buy day-to-day goods at a supermarket, consumer durables or home services, make purchases in hotels, restaurants, venues for culture and sports or petrol stations, or buy tickets or other goods from vending machines. SPACE 2022 aimed to capture different payment situations as accurately as possible in order to understand how consumers’ payment behaviour differs across a variety of locations and purposes (see Chart 12).
Most transactions, both in terms of number and value, were made in supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day goods. Their share of the total number of purchases was 54% in 2022. The share of restaurants, cafes and hotels was 18%.
The breakdown of payments by location remained essentially stable from SPACE 2019. In 2022 consumers were making slightly more transactions in supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day goods. Payments at restaurants, cafes and hotels declined slightly; this may reflect patterns learnt during the pandemic. While food stores were kept open during most lockdown periods, restaurants and hotels stayed closed for extended periods in some euro area countries. The share of payments at venues for sports, culture and entertainment also declined, but this figure was already relatively low in 2019. Although there were no significant lockdowns during the fieldwork periods in the autumn of 2021 and spring of 2022, consumption behaviour learnt during the pandemic may still have had a longer-term behavioural impact on consumers. Looking at the value of POS transactions, only limited changes in payment behaviour by location were witnessed compared with 2019.
Cash was used most frequently for payments at vending machines (74%), in restaurants and hotels (68%) and in supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day goods (61%). In shops selling durable goods the share of card transactions was higher than the share of cash transactions (51% compared to 39%). Mobile app payments were used with similar frequency across all locations; the share varied between 3% and 5%. The highest share of mobile payments was reported in venues for culture and sports (see Chart 13).
Overall, consumers were using cash less frequently at the POS in 2022 than they did 2019. There are considerable differences in how this change in behaviour was observed in various types of locations. The share of cash transactions declined by more than 10 percentage points in restaurants and hotels, venues for culture and sports, supermarkets and other shops selling day-to-day items, as well as in other places, which includes home services, public offices and other non-categorised venues. On the other hand, cash was used in 2022 at approximately the same frequency for payments at petrol stations and vending machines as in 2019. In fact, the share of cash payments by value at these locations even increased.
SPACE collects data on online payments by purpose, distinguishing between the most frequent purposes of non-recurring payments, such as food and daily supplies, clothes, household durables and media and entertainment (e.g. games and music). Between 2019 and 2022 consumers increased their online shopping considerably, as mentioned earlier. The breakdown of online payments by purpose also changed considerably.
Online shopping for food and daily supplies, including both restaurant and grocery store deliveries, has become much more frequent. Online delivery was the only available means of purchasing restaurant food almost everywhere at the height of lockdown, with evidence suggesting consumers may have retained the habit even after the pandemic. The share of payments for food in all online payments has grown from 10% to 24%, as seen in Chart 14. Buying medicine and cosmetics online has also become more frequent. The share of online payments for all other purposes decreased compared to payments for food and medicine. Given the large increase in total online shopping, this does not necessarily indicate that the total value of online shopping for these purposes (e.g. clothes and consumer durables) has decreased.
In addition to day-to-day payments, consumers make various kinds of recurring payments on a weekly, monthly, annual or other basis. SPACE 2022 collected information on recurring payments in eight categories: rent or mortgage, utility bills, insurance, telephone or internet bills, taxes and public charges, subscriptions (e.g. magazines, sports club, streaming TV), season tickets for transport and loans. The SPACE data refer to payments made by individuals during the 30-day reporting period.[25]
Recurring payments were most frequently used for telephone and internet bills (78%), followed by utility bills (70%) and insurance (51%), as indicated in Chart 15. About 20% of consumers paid back consumer loans and 14% purchased season tickets for public transport. The average value of payments differs substantially between the various payment types, from €41 for subscriptions to almost €600 for rent or mortgage.
Recurring payments are of a very different nature to daily transactions, and consequently the patterns of using various payment instruments are also different. For most types of recurring payment direct debit was the most frequently used instrument, used by approximately half of consumers. Another 30-40% paid their recurring bills by credit transfer. Cards, cash or other instruments were used by less than 10% of consumers for most recurring payments.
Two categories, subscriptions to magazines, streaming TV, etc. and tickets for public transport follow different patterns (Chart 16). This may be explained by the smaller amounts of such payments, as well as the distinct profile of consumers opting to make such payments and the fact that transport tickets are normally bought at physical locations (e.g. dedicated machines). While direct debit was the most frequently used method for subscriptions, card payments were used most often for transport tickets. For the latter, 24% of recurring payments were made in cash, indicating that they are often made at the POS rather than remotely.
6.1 The importance of having the option to pay with cash
While use of and preferences for cash payments are on a declining trend, the importance of cash remains at a high level.[26]Overall, 60% of the euro area population considered having the option to pay with cash to be very or fairly important, as it can be seen in Chart 17. More than half of the population considered the option to pay with cash fairly or very important in this survey, even in countries like Belgium, Luxembourg and Finland, where consumers were using other payment options for the majority of POS purchases.
Looking across demographic groups, Chart 18 shows that the ability to always pay in cash seemed to be more important for respondents older than 55 and those with upper/post-secondary education, with no notable differences by gender.
6.2 Preferences at the POS
How people pay can be influenced by various factors; revealed preferences may be one of these. Payment preferences play a major role in guiding consumers’ use of different payment methods and are influenced by several factors: age, income, habits, education, job, etc. This section shows the declining preference for cash at the POS as well as the trends for online payments.
The extent to which paying by different means (cash, cards, credit transfer, direct debit, e-money or other means) is preferred differed greatly from country to country (Chart 19). Overall, the general preference for cash decreased by 5 percentage points from SPACE 2019 (Chart 20). Since 2016, strict cash preference has witnessed a steady decline – from 32% of the respondents preferring it in 2016, down to 27% in 2019 and 22% in 2022.
Nonetheless, in a few countries the preference for cash increased from 2019: Belgium (up 9 percentage points), Estonia (up 7 percentage points), France (up 5 percentage points), Austria (up 3 percentage points) and Slovenia (up 2 percentage points).[27]See Chart 20.
Despite a declining stated preference for cash, it remained the most used payment instrument for POS transactions, being used in 59% of them (see Chart 2). Once again, this is testament to the discrepancy between consumers’ stated preferences and their actual behaviour, as identified in previous studies such as SPACE 2019. The reasons might be various. The question is asked in general, and no distinction can be made between high-volume payments and low-volume ones. Respondents might have a preference for cash when making low-value payments, for instance. Another reason could be acceptance of different means of payment on the part of the merchant. The literature suggests that higher cash usage is associated with lower levels of perceived card acceptance at the POS (Bagnall et al., 2016; Wakamori and Welte, 2017).
Looking at euro area results by demographics (see Chart 21), no big difference emerged between male and female behaviour. Around 21% of male respondents and 22% of female respondents preferred cash, compared to 55% of male and 54% of female respondents who preferred cashless payment.[28]A more pronounced difference can be seen in the attitude of people in the age groups 18-24 and 65+. In fact, 24% of each of these two categories stated they prefer cash, against 20% of the age groups 25-39 and 40-54. 23% of respondents aged 55-64 expressed a cash preference. In terms of education level, 24% of respondents with a primary or lower-secondary education declared they prefer cash, against 17% of people holding a university-level education or a PhD.
6.3 Perceived advantages of payment instruments, cash and cards
According to Hernandez et al (2017), how consumers perceive payment instruments, and their characteristics influences payment behaviour. SPACE 2022 collected information on the perceived main advantages of cash and cards. The main reasons why cash is preferred were: (i) cash is considered to make one more aware of one’s own expenses; (ii) cash is perceived as anonymous (and therefore protects privacy); (iii) cash transactions are perceived to be immediately settled. The first two reasons were chosen by 40% of the population (see Chart 22).
Two of the three most important perceived advantages of cash have changed dramatically over the past five years.[29]In 2016, 42% of the population stated that by using cash they had a clear overview of their own spending. However, when it came to the second and third advantages, 38% answered that cash was always accepted (against the 27% in 2022 who said it was accepted in more situations), while 32% stated that cash payments were fast (against 19% in 2022). Not only has the preference for the wide acceptance of cash declined – anonymity has acquired a more prominent role in respondents’ opinions, rising from 13% in 2016 to over 40% in 2022. This could be partly for methodological reasons, as anonymity and privacy protection were bundled together in 2022, while the 2019 survey only asked respondents about their preference for anonymity. However, since not all respondents may appreciate the difference between anonymity and privacy protection, it is possible that awareness of privacy protection has increased. The fact that cash payments are immediately settled has acquired importance; in 2016 only 13% selected that option as an advantage. The ease and safety of cash payments, on the other hand, have stayed relatively constant (ease: 21% in 2016, 19% in 2022; safety: 16% in 2016, 17% in 2022).
When it comes to the advantages of card payments, a relatively large majority (62%) saw the key advantage as being that they don’t have to carry a lot of cash with them (see Chart 23). In 2016 only 33% cited a similar, although not identical, reason (avoiding the need to check whether you are carrying enough cash). Other reasons selected for preferring cards to cash have hardly changed. The share of the population deeming card payments easier has decreased slightly (down from 40% to 37%), while the share of those thinking card transactions are faster has grown 5 percentage points (up from 35% to 40% of respondents). Consumers feeling that card transactions are safer have increased 3 percentage points (23% to 26%). Almost no change is visible in consumers who see widespread acceptance as a top advantage (20% in 2016; 19% in 2022).
This section presents an analysis of both cash reserves and cash in wallet maintained by euro area citizens.
The likelihood of using cash for transactions increases when the level of cash holdings is higher (Bagnall et al., 2016; Arango et al., 2015). Estimating the amount of cash in wallet might shed light on the reasons behind consumers’ decision to pay in cash. Respondents in the survey were asked to report the exact amount of cash in their wallet at the beginning of the day. People in the euro area possessed an average of €83 in their wallet, as shown in Chart 24. The average amount of cash held varied across countries. In Austria, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Lithuania the average amount was more than €110 – not too divergent from the 2019 findings.
As already seen in SPACE 2019, cash is also used as a store of value in the euro area (European Central Bank, 2020). Indeed, estimates from 2019 suggest that as much as around 28-50% of the value of euro banknotes in circulation is used to store value in the euro area (Zamora-Pérez, 2021). The new survey data from 2022 indicate that people are keeping more cash reserves now than before (37% of euro area consumers in 2022, compared with 34% in 2019), as depicted in Chart 25. It could be that this was because of the pandemic and uncertainty in the economy, and a perceived need to keep cash on hand at home because it is portable, fungible, and immediately useful offline. Cash might also be habitual for some groups, and cash management is a useful way to keep track of a fixed budget (Financial Conduct Authority, 2021). In the euro area, Slovakia (58%) and Estonia (49%) ranked among the highest in the share of population reporting they keep extra cash on hand as a store of value. France (30%) and Cyprus (25%) ranked lowest. Cyprus also saw the highest share of the population refusing to answer whether they keep extra cash holdings – almost 10%. This shows that cash management can be a deeply personal issue for many people, and is in line with the 40% of people who like the anonymity cash affords them.
Cash received as part of income could influence cash usage in transactions. The results show that most euro area citizens (85%) did not receive any regular income in cash (see Chart 26). This figure was marginally higher in 2019, at 87%. Greece was an outlier, in that 11% of people in that country received up to a quarter of their income in cash (roughly twice the euro area average of 5%); 8% received half and 9% received more than three-quarters. This indicates a stronger cash dependency in Greece than other Member States, at least in terms of willingness to accept cash as opposed to other options like direct deposit.
Ensuring equitable access to cash is a fundamental part of the Eurosystem’s Cash 2030 Strategy. The overall number of ATMs per inhabitant has increased slightly, but only partly offset the continued closure of bank branches (Zamora-Pérez, 2022). However, in some euro area countries – most notably Belgium and the Netherlands – the ATM network has actually shrunk (Zamora-Pérez, 2022) leading to concerns about the ability of more vulnerable people to make payments. The Eurosystem also looks into how access for all citizens can be promoted in the payments sector, as part of its retail payments strategy.[30]With the payment mix undergoing continued changes, it is the role of the Eurosystem to ensure that people continue to have the freedom to pay wherever they want, irrespective of geographical location. Access to a given means of payment can be an important factor in determining how people decide to pay. Anticipating trends in changing payment behaviour and the logistical requirements needed to continue to provide cash is a way of upholding people’s universal right to public money should they choose to use it. Cash can be obtained from various sources: withdrawals in bank branches, from ATMs and from retailers via cashback services or cash-in-shop.
8.1 Access to cash
Access to cash withdrawals is a key way of measuring how much freedom of choice consumers ultimately have when making a payment. The ease with which it can be accessed may influence consumers’ propensity to choose cash when deciding what option to use from the range of payment methods available. When asked about their views on ease of access to cash withdrawals (Chart 27), half (50%) of the population polled said access to cash withdrawals was very easy, which is roughly similar to the results in 2019. Another 39% scored it as fairly easy while only 7% said it was fairly difficult and 3% found it very difficult.
Specifically on cash withdrawals (Chart 28), there was a worsening trend in the difficulty of obtaining cash from ATMs in some countries, especially Belgium (up 12 percentage points) and the Netherlands and Luxembourg (each up 7 percentage points). However, most countries across the euro area have seen a perceived increase in ease of access to cash withdrawals. Lithuania (minus 3 percentage points) and Estonia (minus 4 percentage points) both witnessed reductions in the difficulty of accessing an ATM, as did Slovenia (also minus 4 percentage points). Other countries to see modest gains include Greece (minus 1 percentage point); the most substantial improvement in ease of access to cash from ATMs was in Malta (minus 6 percentage points). In four countries (Ireland, France, Italy and Latvia), perceived ease of access remained stable.
The European Commission (2022) noted that 46% of all EU citizens find it very easy to withdraw cash at ATMs or a physical bank branch in the area where they live, and 40% find it rather easy.[31]
As already mentioned, the Eurosystem is committed to ensuring that people and businesses have access to their money – whatever their preferences and payment needs.
Cash can be accessed from various sources: bank branches, an ATM, or cashback and cash-in-shop services provided by retailers.[32]The preferred source of withdrawal remained ATMs, while Germany (30%) and Malta (25%) boasted the highest share of respondents citing cash reserves as a third-order preference, as shown in Chart 29.[33]
Fees and the number of withdrawals permitted vary across countries. As with ease of access, this may influence consumer withdrawal patterns and, in the absence of an alternative source of cash, exacerbate problems related to access. Chart 30 shows the frequency at which consumers reported having to pay fees, highlighting the different fee structures across countries. In most countries, more than half of consumers report not having to pay a fee at all. Exceptions to this include Ireland, where 24% of consumers said they always pay a fee when withdrawing, and Belgium (14%) – one of the countries where ease of access to cash has become more difficult since 2019.
8.2 Access to non-cash means of payment
Access to other payment options is of paramount importance for financial inclusion. Consumers cannot make card payments without prior access to a payment card or pay by credit transfer or direct debit if they do not hold payment accounts. Consequently, the survey asked people whether they had access to payment accounts and payment cards. It also touched on evolving trends such as ownership and use of crypto assets, described in Box 3.
Chart 31 shows that, on average, 94% of respondents in the euro area reported having access to a payment card, while 91% reported having an account for payments. The country breakdown shows that the share of consumers that have access to an account for payments was highest in Germany (99%); Greece was lowest at 79%.[34]Germany and Finland reported the highest percentage with access to a payment card (99% each), while Portugal (79%) reported the lowest.
Survey responses show that in most countries the younger segment of the population (18-24) is less likely to hold payment accounts than older age groups, although this is not always the case. While holding payment accounts and payment cards often go hand in hand, it is always possible to hold one without the other; but choosing to do so will limit payment options. However, when averaged out across the euro area, there was only a slight discrepancy between those holding payment accounts (91%) and those holding cards (94%). It could be that people use prepaid cards for which no account is needed, or credit cards may be linked to accounts held by other family members, such as parents or spouses. Interestingly, a small percentage of people in most countries in most age groups responded that they did not hold payment accounts, payment cards or crypto assets. It is reasonable to suppose that these people rely largely on cash for payments, although they might rely on friends or family members whenever they need to pay with something other than cash, for example when purchasing online. Overall, twice as many age cohorts across all countries were more likely to hold a payment card than a payment account; but the differences were sometimes small.
The results show only very slight differences between the shares of the rural and urban population with access to payment accounts and cards (see Chart 32). For example, a small urban-rural gap was observed in access to payment accounts (87% in urban areas and 89% in rural areas) and access to cards (91% in urban areas and 92% in rural areas).There was also an identical difference of 2 percentage points across payment accounts and cards at all education levels: 89% of the population with primary/lower-secondary education held a payment account and 91% a card, while 92% of the population with both upper-secondary and university/PhD/research education had a payment account and 94% a card. These small differences make it difficult to tell from the statistics alone whether a greater preference for cards over payment accounts is associated with the level of education or rurality, and hence further research on this topic is encouraged.
A key goal of the Eurosystem’s retail payments strategy[35]is full deployment of Single Euro Payments Area Instant Credit Transfers (SCT Inst), i.e. instant payments[36]. These can be defined as retail payments that are processed in real time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with funds made available immediately for use by the recipient.[37]
The perceived availability of instant payments was highest in Luxembourg (63%) and lowest in Greece (33%). In the Netherlands and Estonia, countries typically associated with more digitalised forms of payment, 36% and 19% respectively of the population had not heard of the service.[38]This may be attributable to respondents not knowing what SCT Inst is, being unaware that it is the default in their market or conflating it with another means of payment; the data provide no clear indication. Overall, the euro area average (Chart 33) points to 51% of the population with perceived access to instant payments, with 22% having stated that the service is not available to them.[39]
One factor assessed in the survey was whether users pay fees for instant payments (Chart 34). There are considerable differences between countries. 95% of respondents in Cyprus and 89% in Spain said they pay either no fee or the same fee as for credit transfers, but only 46% of respondents in Germany gave the same answer. This may be partly because almost one-third of German respondents did not know whether they paid a fee, which was the highest percentage in any of the countries surveyed. However, 38% of people in Italy and 23% in Germany paid a higher fee for instant credit transfers. Italy was also the only country where more people reported paying higher fees for instant credit transfers than reported paying no fees at all.
8.3 Acceptance of cash and other cashless means of payment
There is evidence to suggest a circular relationship between acceptance of different payment methods by merchants and the probability of consumers using them. Merchant acceptance conditions how people pay. However, it could also follow that merchants’ preference for a particular means of payment depends on the number of customers who use it (McAndrews and Wang, 2012). This feedback loop can potentially have profound effects on the payment methods used for POS transactions.
When calculating the share of reported POS transactions where cash was accepted, Chart 35 shows that, in general, cash was still widely accepted in all countries. However, compared to 2019, acceptance has declined in all countries, except for the Netherlands[41]. On average, 95% of the POS transactions could be carried out using cash according to respondents, compared to 98% in 2019.[42]Interestingly, the cash acceptance rate among companies in the entire euro area foundby the European Central Bank (2022b) stood at 96% in 2021, which indicates that perceived cash acceptance by consumers deviates only slightly in aggregate.
As regards the option to use cashless payment methods, Chart 36 shows that it was possible to pay with non-cash payment instruments in 81% of transactions in the euro area, a slight increase of two percentage points since 2019. Acceptance of different cashless means of payment seems to have increased in most countries except for Malta, Lithuania, France, Finland and Luxembourg.
Following its predecessors – starting in 2016 with SUCH (Esselink and Hernández, 2017) and SPACE 2019 (European Central Bank, 2020) – SPACE 2022 describes the evolving nature of the payment behaviour of consumers across all 19 euro-area countries. It sheds light on the trends affecting payment preferences, alongside self-stated preferences for and perceived advantages of different payment methods such as cash and card payments. It also addresses differing levels of access to and acceptance of cash and other means of payment. The study further describes the perceived short-term impact of the pandemic on consumer payment behaviour, although a longer time span may be needed to identify whether this was transitory or an acceleration of an existing trend.
The findings on payment behaviour show that cash was the most frequently used payment method at the POS in the euro area, representing 59% of the total number of payments (down from 72% in 2019). Card payments were used in 34% of POS transactions (up from 25% in 2019) and mobile payments in 3% (up from 1% in 2019). Contactless payments experienced the strongest increase of all card payments at the POS over the three years since SPACE 2019 was conducted, up from 41% in 2019 to 62% in 2022. Trends towards online payments are also pronounced; this is visible in the rising share of online payments in consumers’ daily purchases (up from 6% in 2019 to 17% in 2022), particularly online payments for food and daily supplies. Cash remained the dominant means of payment in P2P transactions, although it declined from 86% in 2019 to 73% in 2022. This fall was mainly driven by the increase in mobile apps for P2P payments.
All this shows an acceleration of the previous trend toward the use of cashless means of payment already observed between 2016 and 2019. Nonetheless, since the outbreak of the pandemic, more than half of consumers (54%) reported no change in their use of cash at the POS, and 14% said that they used cash more often than before. Roughly one-third of consumers (31%) are using cash less often than before the pandemic; these are the ones driving the overall acceleration towards use of cashless means of payments at the POS.
In terms of stated preferences, 60% of consumers considered the option to pay with cash to be important or very important. Despite the impact of the pandemic and related lockdown measures and self-reported preferences, an increasing share of euro area consumers would like to have cash as a payment option. This contrasts with self-reported preferences for cash or cashless; 55% of respondents say they prefer cashless means of payments (up from 49% in 2019), while 22% prefer cash and 23% have no clear preference.
The data on consumer preferences for the different attributes of cash and cards suggest they demand the two categories for different reasons. The perception that cash makes one more aware of one’s own expenses and its anonymity and privacy were ranked as the main advantages of using cash. Convenience and the fact that fewer items need to be carried around were perceived as the main advantages of card payments. This shows that, depending on the profile of the consumer, both means of payments serve a function in the retail payments landscape.
The overwhelming majority of consumers (90%) found it easy to withdraw cash from an ATM or bank, which is similar to the euro area average in 2019. However, a country-level breakdown shows that this conceals a decline in access to cash in five countries, alongside improved access to cash in the rest of the euro area. As for merchant acceptance, cash was reportedly accepted at 95% of all physical payment locations.
The survey suggests that people are now keeping more cash reserves than before.
On average, 91% of consumers stated that they have access to an account for payments, while 94% said they have access to a payment card. Instant payments are available to 51% of euro area consumers. The survey also shed light on recent developments such as the adoption of crypto assets; it found that overall uptake is still marginal and primarily driven by speculation rather than by transactional use. Non-cash means of payment were reportedly accepted for 81% of payments at physical payment locations.
Insights into the evolution of payment behaviour and payment attitudes can yield important information for the ECB, allowing it to implement timely policy measures and continue to ensure equitable access to public money. The information is also helpful for monitoring trends on the use of new means of payment as they gain increasing relevance across the euro area. It is therefore of fundamental importance to repeat the SPACE study regularly and retain its methodology if the ECB is to continue monitoring changes and trends in the retail payment landscape.
